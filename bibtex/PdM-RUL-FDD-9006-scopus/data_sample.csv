"Rolling bearing fault diagnosis method of acoustic and vibration multi-level fusion with attention-1DCNN Bearing faults are one of the most common causes of machine failures. However, due to the diverse nature of fault characteristics, a single sensor is insufficient for accurately identifying these features. Multi-source signals contain more comprehensive fault feature information. In order to effectively integrate multi-sensor signals and improve fault recognition accuracy, this paper proposes a rolling bearing fault diagnosis method based on acoustic-vibration multi-level fusion and Attention-1DCNN. Firstly, a single Attention-1DCNN module is employed to extract self-features from both the acoustic emission signal and vibration signal separately. Subsequently, complementary features are extracted from the fused acoustic emission and vibration signals using a feature mapping stacking method for fault identification. Finally, through softmax regression analysis, the fused features are classified into specific faults. The effectiveness of the proposed method was validated using an experimentally constructed dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that under various fault modes such as outer ring crack, inner ring crack, and rolling body pitting, the proposed method achieved 100% recognition accuracy. Compared with single-sensor or single-level fusion diagnostic methods, this approach exhibits higher diagnostic accuracy and improved robustness. © 2024 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85219599283
"Predictive Failure Analysis of Spindle Motor & Cutting Oil Condition Monitoring of Grinding Machine using Artificial Intelligence Models With the advent of Industry 4.0, manufacturing industries are competing to adopt intelligent machining systems to deliver high performance in minimum possible time. Machine downtimes results in hefty production loss(s). To avoid them, we must identify their causes (spindle failure in our case) and predict their occurrences. We used vibration analysis methods to analyze wear-tear of spindle during running condition. Our objective is to design a low-cost smart maintenance model to predict the failure before its occurrence using Support Vector Machine model. Additionally, condition-monitoring of cutting fluid by analyzing variation in temperature of rotating spindle, pH due to Sulphur concentration has been included. Learning Vector Quantization algorithm is used for data analysis of sensors monitoring the health of cutting fluids and filter oil. Time Series Analysis has been performed on pH data to predict the pH of cutting fluid for prevention of cutting fluid deterioration. The model is tested for a good range of working conditions and results are found more promising than existing system. © 2020 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85101539067
"Model-based fault detection and localization algorithm for air handling units in large-scale buildings This work presents the design of a model-based algorithm that detects and identifies the location of faults that may occur in Air Handling Unit (AHU) components such as valves or temperature sensors in large-scale buildings. The detection process is based on the design of residuals; i.e., the difference between measured and estimated values of the system states, and adaptive thresholds; i.e., an online signal designed to bound the residual under fault-free conditions, considering known bounds on modeling uncertainty and measurement noise. The presence of a fault in a certain AHU component may cause the corresponding residual to exceed the adaptive threshold, thus triggering an alarm. Different types of faults can affect the relations of residuals and thresholds in a distinct manner, which facilitates the design of a combinatorial logic to indicate the type and location of faults. The performance of the proposed algorithm is investigated through a simulation analysis of a 25-zone building modeled in EnergyPlus. © 2020 16th Conference of the International Society of Indoor Air Quality and Climate: Creative and Smart Solutions for Better Built Environments, Indoor Air 2020.

"The Initial Structural Health Monitoring System of the Nibelungen Bridge Worms As an essential part of the validation project for the German Research Foundation-funded Priority Program SPP 100+, an initial structural health monitoring system was implemented on the Nibelungen Bridge in Worms. The aim of this system is to monitor the general behavior of the bridge for further development of condition indicators, and to provide real data to all research partners and other relevant users to validate their methods. In this scope, 20 sensors, including humidity, temperature, inclination, linear variable differential transformer, and acceleration sensors, have been installed on the bridge. The quality of the recorded data, including measurement technical traceability, completeness, and reliability are guaranteed. Subsequently, both the raw data and the first statistically evaluated values, including the maximum, average, and minimum values, are saved. These raw and first-hand data are made available to the involved research partners in a possible real-time manner. In addition, a web-based visualization platform has also been established that allows users to directly access deviations of measured values from different sensors. The results of the first 11 months confirm the plausibility of the monitoring data. © 2024 11th European Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring, EWSHM 2024. All rights reserved.",2-s2.0-85202570011
"Test research on poor contact defect detection of GIS based on temperature and vibration GIS is the key equipment in power transmission and transformation system, and its operation fault seriously affects the reliability of power supply. According to statistics, GIS faults caused by poor contact defects account for 29%. Therefore, this paper builds a GIS test platform to study the characteristics of GIS contact defects. This test platform takes GIS branch bus with disconnector as the main research object and simulates poor contact state by adjusting contact insertion depth. A stable AC current is provided for the test platform through a high current lifter. Relevant data are obtained by temperature sensor, infrared camera and vibration sensor. The equipment in good contact state and poor contact state were compared in terms of temperature and vibration. It is found that when GIS contact is not good, the shell temperature rises and the high-frequency component of vibration signal on the shell increases significantly. It is proved that temperature method and vibration method are feasible to study the GIS contact defects on the test platform. © 2020 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85100730328

"Simulation Analysis of Partial Discharge Detection and Localization of Power Cable Based on ATP-EMTP Partial discharge(PD) is an effective method to evaluate the insulation state of power cables. Accurate detection and localization of PD signals in cables can be conducive to detect the early fault of the cables.Where to place the sensor to capture and locate the PD signals is a problem in the cable system that one end of the sheath is grounded and one end the sheath is grounded through the sheath protector. For the purpose of solving this problem, we build a ethylenepropylene rubber insulated(EPR) power cable model in ATP-EMTP and study propagation characteristics of PD signals in cables as well as the coupling effect between the conductor and the sheath of the cables. Then the cable system that one end of the sheath is grounded and one end the sheath is grounded through the sheath protector is built. And the optimal installation position of the sensor is determined by simulation. Based on the above research,the PD signals can be located by using the two-terminal location method. © 2020 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85087501853

"Artificial Intelligence in Next Generation IoT Infrastructure: Challenges and Opportunities Numerous facets of the public realm could be revolutionised by the convergence of the Internet of Things (the Internet of Things) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). This project developed a based-on data predictive maintenance system for manufacturing production lines. One of these anticipated improvements that can be included into the factory's production system is 'AI of Things (AIoT),' which refers to the use of the IoT to carry out intelligent tasks with the aid of AI integration.

"Practical Implementation of Multiple Faults in a Coupled-Tank System: Verified by Model-Based Fault Detection Methods In order to prevent system failures, fault detection and performance assessment are always essential factors. This article investigates the practical implementation of common faults in a two-tank networked control system, one of the most widely utilized liquid-level control systems in the food industries, petrochemicals, and many more. The system was modeled and controlled, and then, faults were conducted on the system, including leakage, sedimentation, sensor bias, and pump stuck, which covered a wide range of fault types. After that, model-based fault detection methods, such as unknown input observer (UIO), parity, and factorization methods, were employed to evaluate fault implementation. By thresholding residuals of fault detection methods, the factorization method shows the most effective performance concerning false alarm rates (FAR), missed alarm rates (MAR), and detection delays (DD). Using the UIO is a suitable substitute, and parity is only appropriate for announcing the fault start time.  © 2023 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85185563016
