"Multiple IMU Fusion Algorithm Comparison for Sounding Rocket Attitude Applications Micro-electro-mechanical (MEMS) technology is known to offer a wide variety of advantages for navigation and guidance purposes in terms of cost, size and weight. However, sensor accuracy limits its applications. The use of a Redundant Inertial Measurement Unit (RIMU) configuration allows combining inertial observations not only to obtain a better performances for attitude estimation, but also to be able to detect and isolate a sensor not properly working. The output signals of uncorrelated IMU sensors can be integrated using a data fusion algorithm (e.g Extended Kalman Filter, EKF). The aim of this study is to present the implementation of several filters for an array of consumer grade IMUs placed on a ""skew-redundant"" configuration in a sounding rocket vehicle. The filtering method allows designing an attitude estimator capable of improving the kinematic predictions from gyroscope measurement integration by applying a correction method from accelerometer and magnetometer data. Moreover, simulations are performed to analyze the resilience and fault detection, while laboratory tests check the performance of the two proposed architectures. With the aim of testing accuracy of the algorithms for the RIMU a software simulation tool and laboratory tests are presented. © 2022 35th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation, ION GNSS+ 2022.

"Development of a cyber physical production system framework for 3D printing analytics[Formula presented] 3D printing technology is considered one of the emerging areas to deal with global sustainability challenges and to facilitate the Industry 4.0 adoption. However, 3D printing technology is still immature due to several limitations and negative perceptions about its quality and performance. The goal of this paper is to propose a cyber physical production system (CPPS) framework for a 3D printer to (i) monitor the process, parameters, and carbon footprint, (ii) predict the nozzle's remaining useful life (RUL), and (iii) prescribe optimum 3D printing parameters for minimizing carbon footprint and printing time, simultaneously at the targeted surface quality. Experiments were designed based on Taguchi L-27 orthogonal array to investigate the relationship between printing parameters and performance characteristics. The usefulness of the proposed framework has been demonstrated for a 3D printer to predict the remaining useful life of the printer nozzle (prognostic model), and to find an optimal combination of printing parameters for the simultaneous optimization of sustainability and productivity at the targeted surface quality (prescriptive model). Layer height was found to have a statically significant impact on the specific carbon footprint followed by scale and bed temperature. Layer height is the only statically significant contributor to the surface roughness of 3D printed parts. The scale and layer height followed by infill have significant effect on the printing time. The significance of the present work lies in enhancing the performance of a conventional 3D printer using low-cost smart sensors, devices, and open-source software. The usefulness of the proposed CPPS framework is demonstrated as a decision support tool for a 3D printer real-time monitoring, visualization, and control. The proposed CPPS framework and its application for prognostic and prescriptive analytics is generic in nature, and is transferable and applicable to other FDM 3D printers, irrespective of brand and size. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",2-s2.0-85168427262,"development cyber physical production system framework 3d printing analytics[formula presented ] 3d printing technology considered emerging areas deal global sustainability challenges facilitate industry 4.0 adoption . , 3d printing technology immature limitations negative perceptions quality performance . goal paper propose cyber physical production system ( cpps ) framework 3d printer ( ) monitor process , parameters , carbon footprint , ( ii ) predict nozzle remaining useful life ( rul ) , ( iii ) prescribe optimum 3d printing parameters minimizing carbon footprint printing time , simultaneously targeted surface quality . experiments designed based taguchi l-27 orthogonal array investigate relationship printing parameters performance characteristics . usefulness proposed framework demonstrated 3d printer predict remaining useful life printer nozzle ( prognostic model ) , find optimal combination printing parameters simultaneous optimization sustainability productivity targeted surface quality ( prescriptive model ) . layer height found statically significant impact specific carbon footprint followed scale bed temperature . layer height statically significant contributor surface roughness 3d printed parts . scale layer height followed infill significant effect printing time . significance present work lies enhancing performance conventional 3d printer low - cost smart sensors , devices , open - source software . usefulness proposed cpps framework demonstrated decision support tool 3d printer real - time monitoring , visualization , control . proposed cpps framework application prognostic prescriptive analytics generic nature , transferable applicable fdm 3d printers , irrespective brand size . © 2023 elsevier b.v."
"Integrating electro-mechanical impedance data with machine learning for damage detection and classification of blended concrete systems In recent years, the assessment of structural integrity and durability of concrete systems has significantly advanced with the integration of novel sensing technologies and data-driven techniques. This study introduces an innovative approach that utilizes electro-mechanical impedance (EMI) data acquired through embedded piezo sensors (EPS) to monitor and analyze the condition of blended concrete systems. Moreover, the study involves blended concrete specimens are subjected to controlled damage scenarios under mechanical loadings to establish EPS as an early warning sensor for detecting damage in these systems. Furthermore, the extent of damage under these loadings is comprehensively evaluated using statistical indices and an equivalent stiffness parameter. Additionally, the study focuses on the application of machine learning (ML) algorithms to interpret EMI data for efficient damage classification. ML models, such as decision trees (DT), random forests (RF), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machines (SVM), and naive Bayes (NB) are trained to identify patterns correlating with different types and extents of structural damage. Among them, the RF classifier exhibits the highest accuracy of 0.91, followed by DT, KNN, SVM, and NB with accuracies of 0.88, 0.86, 0.68, and 0.17 respectively. The integration of EMI data with ML approaches demonstrates significant potential to revolutionize predictive maintenance strategies, enabling precise classification of structural damage and providing critical insights for engineers and stakeholders to proactively address issues, thereby significantly enhancing the safety, durability, and lifespan of concrete infrastructure.

"Hierarchical cognize framework for the multi-fault diagnosis of the interconnected system based on domain knowledge and data fusion An interconnected system (ICS) is a complex industry system with multiple sensors, multiple tasks, and massive interaction. It is also of great importance for conducting the fault diagnosis technology research. Multi-fault diagnosis (MFD) is an urgent problem in engineering, while the complex mapping relationships among the system sensors, data patterns in single sensors, and fault modes in ICSs bringing severe challenges. The faults of ICS are similar to human disease in multiple dimensions. Enlightening the understanding of diseases in medicine guides us: hierarchical cognition and knowledge-data-fusion are important systematic ideas. Inspired by these, we propose a hierarchical cognize framework (HCF), which covers the cognition of sensors, data patterns in single sensors, and data climates. Subsequently, we propose a fuzzy neighbourhood three-way decision (FN3WD), experience fused self-adaptation Gaussian-mixture-model (EFSA-GMM), and coding-with-knowledge-discrimination (CWKD) to construct an HCF. To comprehensively verify the HCF, we successfully apply the HCF to the MFD of a satellite power system. Classic models of two-mainstream strategies are introduced as comparisons, specifically, MC-DCNN, MC-SVM, ML-DCNN, and ML-SVM. Compared to the comparative models, the HCF performs an increase of 12.35%, 7.72%, 6.90%, and 8.10% at least in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, respectively, in 10 times cross-validation. Benefitting from the fusion of knowledge, the HCF has cognitive advantages in obtaining a high accuracy and precision diagnosis results. Meanwhile, the time consumption of the HCF is approximately 130 s, which is considerably reduced by as much as 50% compared with the deep learning models. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85122626606,"hierarchical cognize framework multi - fault diagnosis interconnected system based domain knowledge data fusion interconnected system ( ics ) complex industry system multiple sensors , multiple tasks , massive interaction . great importance conducting fault diagnosis technology research . multi - fault diagnosis ( mfd ) urgent problem engineering , complex mapping relationships system sensors , data patterns single sensors , fault modes icss bringing severe challenges . faults ics similar human disease multiple dimensions . enlightening understanding diseases medicine guides : hierarchical cognition knowledge - data - fusion important systematic ideas . inspired , propose hierarchical cognize framework ( hcf ) , covers cognition sensors , data patterns single sensors , data climates . subsequently , propose fuzzy neighbourhood - way decision ( fn3wd ) , experience fused self - adaptation gaussian - mixture - model ( efsa - gmm ) , coding - - knowledge - discrimination ( cwkd ) construct hcf . comprehensively verify hcf , successfully apply hcf mfd satellite power system . classic models - mainstream strategies introduced comparisons , specifically , mc - dcnn , mc - svm , ml - dcnn , ml - svm . compared comparative models , hcf performs increase 12.35 % , 7.72 % , 6.90 % , 8.10 % accuracy , precision , recall , f1 - score , respectively , 10 times cross - validation . benefitting fusion knowledge , hcf cognitive advantages obtaining high accuracy precision diagnosis results . , time consumption hcf approximately 130 s , considerably reduced 50 % compared deep learning models . © 2022 elsevier ltd"

"Asynchronous Fault Detection for Memristive Neural Networks With Dwell-Time-Based Communication Protocol This article studies the asynchronous fault detection filter problem for discrete-time memristive neural networks with a stochastic communication protocol (SCP) and denial-of-service attacks. Aiming at alleviating the occurrence of network-induced phenomena, a dwell-time-based SCP is scheduled to coordinate the packet transmission between sensors and filter, whose deterministic switching signal arranges the proper feedback switching information among the homogeneous Markov processes (HMPs) for different scenarios. A variable obeying the Bernoulli distribution is proposed to characterize the randomly occurring denial-of-service attacks, in which the attack rate is uncertain. More specifically, both dwell-time-based SCP and denial-of-service attacks are modeled by means of compensation strategy. In light of the mode mismatches between data transmission and filter, a hidden Markov model (HMM) is adopted to describe the asynchronous fault detection filter. Consequently, sufficient conditions of stochastic stability of memristive neural networks are devised with the assistance of Lyapunov theory. In the end, a numerical example is applied to show the effectiveness of the theoretical method. © 2012 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85126287322,"asynchronous fault detection memristive neural networks dwell - time - based communication protocol article studies asynchronous fault detection filter problem discrete - time memristive neural networks stochastic communication protocol ( scp ) denial - - service attacks . aiming alleviating occurrence network - induced phenomena , dwell - time - based scp scheduled coordinate packet transmission sensors filter , deterministic switching signal arranges proper feedback switching information homogeneous markov processes ( hmps ) different scenarios . variable obeying bernoulli distribution proposed characterize randomly occurring denial - - service attacks , attack rate uncertain . specifically , dwell - time - based scp denial - - service attacks modeled means compensation strategy . light mode mismatches data transmission filter , hidden markov model ( hmm ) adopted describe asynchronous fault detection filter . consequently , sufficient conditions stochastic stability memristive neural networks devised assistance lyapunov theory . end , numerical example applied effectiveness theoretical method . © 2012 ieee ."
"Fault detection of wheel in wheel/rail system using kurtosis beamforming method Fault detection systems are typically applied in the railway industry to examine the structural health status of the wheel/rail system. We herein propose a time-domain kurtosis beamforming technique using an array of microphones for the fault identification and localisation of the wheel/rail system under an environment with high background noise. As an acoustics-based noncontact diagnosis method, this technique overcomes the challenge of the contact between the sensors and examined structures, and it is more applicable for impulsive signals of broadband nature, such as impact noise generated from faults on the wheel surface. Moreover, the application of kurtosis enables the identification and localisation at low signal-to-noise ratio. Under such circumstance, the impulsive signals generated by faults were totally merged in rolling noise and background noise. Meanwhile, different types of faults on the wheels could be identified and localised by observing the kurtosis value on the beamforming sound map. The effectiveness of the proposed method to diagnose the type of wheel fault with low signal-to-noise ratio and moving source has been validated experimentally. This method may provide a useful tool for the routine maintenance of trains. © The Author(s) 2019.",2-s2.0-85067835259,"fault detection wheel wheel / rail system kurtosis beamforming method fault detection systems typically applied railway industry examine structural health status wheel / rail system . propose time - domain kurtosis beamforming technique array microphones fault identification localisation wheel / rail system environment high background noise . acoustics - based noncontact diagnosis method , technique overcomes challenge contact sensors examined structures , applicable impulsive signals broadband nature , impact noise generated faults wheel surface . , application kurtosis enables identification localisation low signal - - noise ratio . circumstance , impulsive signals generated faults totally merged rolling noise background noise . , different types faults wheels identified localised observing kurtosis value beamforming sound map . effectiveness proposed method diagnose type wheel fault low signal - - noise ratio moving source validated experimentally . method provide useful tool routine maintenance trains . © author(s ) 2019 ."
"Comparison of machine learning algorithms for structure state prediction in operational load monitoring The aim of operational load monitoring is to make predictions about the remaining usability time of structures, which is extremely useful in aerospace industry where in-service life of aircraft structural components can be maximized, taking into account safety. In order to make such predictions, strain sensors are mounted to the structure, from which data are acquired during operational time. This allows to determine how many load cycles has the structure withstood so far. Continuous monitoring of the strain distribution of the whole structure can be complicated due to vicissitude nature of the loads. Sensors should be mounted in places where stress and strain accumulations occur, and due to experiencing variable loads, the number of required sensors may be high. In this work, different machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms are implemented to predict the current safety factor of the structure in its most stressed point, based on relatively low number of strain measurements. Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS), support-vector machines (SVM) and Gaussian processes for machine learning (GPML) are trained with simulation data, and their effectiveness is measured using data obtained from experiments. The proposed methods are compared to the earlier work where artificial neural networks (ANN) were proven to be efficiently used for reduction of the number of sensors in operational load monitoring processes.

"Advancing Light Aircraft Health Monitoring with Flight Phase Clustering This paper addresses the clustering of flight phases of a light aircraft for health monitoring using vibration data. The aim is to improve diagnostic and prognostic functions. Grouping condition monitoring data under similar operating conditions is significant for predictive maintenance. Clustering also supports advanced analytics for fault detection and estimation of remaining life. The proposed framework uses self-organizing maps for flight phase clustering. The findings show that the algorithm can recognize and classify flight phases in various operational domains. Additionally, visualization of cluster maps uncovers complex patterns and non-linear relationships in sensor data under different flight conditions. As a followup, analyzing the vibration properties within these estimated clusters (regimes) provides insights from condition monitoring data behavior during flight phases. The results confirm the effectiveness of the method, but also confirm that determining light aircraft regimes requires more focus due to their unique flight patterns that are absent in commercial airliners.

"Structural health monitoring for corrosion induced thickness loss in marine plates subjected to random loads In the highly corrosive environment where marine structures operate, the current industry practice is to overcompensate for corrosion induced thickness loss (CITL) and replace any parts that score below specified allowable limits during scheduled maintenance. Hence, there would be immediate benefits from the implementation of a Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) system that would allow for predictive, condition-based maintenance. The objective of this study is to investigate and assess the effectiveness of state-of-the-art statistical pattern recognition (SPR) and machine learning (ML) methods in association with alternative sensor grid architectures as an SHM scheme for detecting CITL, under highly variable operational conditions. For this purpose, a simple rectangular plate at different corrosion levels (uniform and pitting) was considered as a reference structural element, which was subjected to a stochastic pressure load. Strain response data were produced using Finite Element (FE) simulations and were treated under a probabilistic framework.

"Unknown fault feature extraction of rolling bearings under variable speed conditions based on statistical complexity measures As the main transmission components of rotating machinery, rolling bearings have important research significance for fault diagnosis and state detection. However, the operating environment of mechanical equipment is complex, and the fault characteristic information of rolling bearings is often unknown. Through the complex transmission path, the bearing seat vibration sensor picks up the fault vibration response is weaker, and it is often submerged by strong noise. When the speed and load of rotating mechanical equipment change, the fault characteristic of rolling bearings is more obvious under variable speed conditions. The fault diagnosis problem of rolling bearings needs to be solved urgently under strong noise background, variable speed, and unknown fault characteristics. Therefore, this paper studies an unknown fault feature extraction method of variable speed rolling bearing based on statistical complexity measures (SCM). Order analysis preprocesses the variable speed vibration signal of rolling bearings. It is convenient for subsequent fault feature extraction and analysis. The SCM selects the optimal intrinsic mode function (IMF) component corresponding to the Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) decomposition, and it is also evaluated index for the optimal response of stochastic resonance. Therefore, the adaptive frequency shift stochastic resonance effectively extracts the unknown fault features of rolling bearings under strong noise background. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85125872513,"unknown fault feature extraction rolling bearings variable speed conditions based statistical complexity measures main transmission components rotating machinery , rolling bearings important research significance fault diagnosis state detection . , operating environment mechanical equipment complex , fault characteristic information rolling bearings unknown . complex transmission path , bearing seat vibration sensor picks fault vibration response weaker , submerged strong noise . speed load rotating mechanical equipment change , fault characteristic rolling bearings obvious variable speed conditions . fault diagnosis problem rolling bearings needs solved urgently strong noise background , variable speed , unknown fault characteristics . , paper studies unknown fault feature extraction method variable speed rolling bearing based statistical complexity measures ( scm ) . order analysis preprocesses variable speed vibration signal rolling bearings . convenient subsequent fault feature extraction analysis . scm selects optimal intrinsic mode function ( imf ) component corresponding empirical mode decomposition ( emd ) decomposition , evaluated index optimal response stochastic resonance . , adaptive frequency shift stochastic resonance effectively extracts unknown fault features rolling bearings strong noise background . © 2022 elsevier ltd"
"Neutralization of temperature effects in damage diagnosis of MDOF systems by combinations of autoencoders and particle filters In the last years, scientific and industrial communities have put a lot of efforts into the development of a new framework for the assessment of structural integrity, generally known as Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), which should allow real-time, automatic evaluations of the state of the structures based on a network of permanently installed sensors. In the context of mechanical, aerospace and civil structures, several approaches have been proposed to address the SHM problem, yet, it remains often difficult to diagnose damages and estimate the structural health when dealing with varying operating and environmental conditions. Particle Filters have already been proposed as a time-domain-based method in the field of SHM, showing promising results as estimators of hidden, not directly observable states, such as those typically related to damages. At the same time, neural networks-based autoencoders have been proposed for structural damage detection, demonstrating to be capable of capturing damage-related features from vibration measurements. This work aims at exploiting the individual advantages offered by the two approaches by combining them in a novel algorithm for structural damage detection and localization, robust with respect to changing environmental conditions. The algorithm is further equipped with a fault indicator module stemming from the introduction of an automatic threshold and both deterministic and probabilistic fault indicators, thus offering a complete, valuable tool for supporting decision making with limited human intervention. The method is demonstrated with reference to a numerical MDOF system whose parameters are taken from a literature benchmark case study. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85107872040,"neutralization temperature effects damage diagnosis mdof systems combinations autoencoders particle filters years , scientific industrial communities lot efforts development new framework assessment structural integrity , generally known structural health monitoring ( shm ) , allow real - time , automatic evaluations state structures based network permanently installed sensors . context mechanical , aerospace civil structures , approaches proposed address shm problem , , remains difficult diagnose damages estimate structural health dealing varying operating environmental conditions . particle filters proposed time - domain - based method field shm , showing promising results estimators hidden , directly observable states , typically related damages . time , neural networks - based autoencoders proposed structural damage detection , demonstrating capable capturing damage - related features vibration measurements . work aims exploiting individual advantages offered approaches combining novel algorithm structural damage detection localization , robust respect changing environmental conditions . algorithm equipped fault indicator module stemming introduction automatic threshold deterministic probabilistic fault indicators , offering complete , valuable tool supporting decision making limited human intervention . method demonstrated reference numerical mdof system parameters taken literature benchmark case study . © 2021 elsevier ltd"
"A data-driven fault detection approach for Modular Reconfigurable Flying Array based on the Improved Deep Forest The Modular Reconfigurable Flying Array, as a kind of special modular rotorcraft UAV, can change its topology configurations fitting for different tasks and varying work scenarios. However, strongly nonlinear characteristics and limited uncertainties of Modular Reconfigurable Flying Array make its sensor faults happen easily and fail to be detected with higher accuracy. In the light of the potential serious losses of its sensors faults, it is valuable and challenging to detect the sensor faults of the aircraft accurately and effectively. Therefore, a data-driven multivariate regression approach based on the Improved Deep Forest is proposed to fulfill sensor faults detection. Firstly, the Deep Forest algorithm is improved by adding the enhanced cascade layer structure and redesigning the inter-layer loss function to pursuit better prediction accuracy. And then, the Improved Deep Forest algorithm is used to establish a multivariate regression model and obtains an estimation of the monitored parameter by learning the historical flight data. Finally, the residual between the actual flight data and the estimated value is calculated to achieve sensor faults detection by comparing with the statistical threshold. What is more, the proposed faults detection approach is evaluated with two real flight datasets collected from the self-made rotorcraft and the experimental results show that the average ACC and AUC are increased by 3% and 2.3% respectively compared with the approach based on the standard Deep Forest. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85145590270,"data - driven fault detection approach modular reconfigurable flying array based improved deep forest modular reconfigurable flying array , kind special modular rotorcraft uav , change topology configurations fitting different tasks varying work scenarios . , strongly nonlinear characteristics limited uncertainties modular reconfigurable flying array sensor faults happen easily fail detected higher accuracy . light potential losses sensors faults , valuable challenging detect sensor faults aircraft accurately effectively . , data - driven multivariate regression approach based improved deep forest proposed fulfill sensor faults detection . firstly , deep forest algorithm improved adding enhanced cascade layer structure redesigning inter - layer loss function pursuit better prediction accuracy . , improved deep forest algorithm establish multivariate regression model obtains estimation monitored parameter learning historical flight data . finally , residual actual flight data estimated value calculated achieve sensor faults detection comparing statistical threshold . , proposed faults detection approach evaluated real flight datasets collected self - rotorcraft experimental results average acc auc increased 3 % 2.3 % respectively compared approach based standard deep forest . © 2022 elsevier ltd"
"Multi-level attention graph feature fusion smooth prognostics approach for aircraft engines remaining useful life prediction In the development of a prognostic and health management system, it is a challenge to mine the degradation characteristics, estimate the RUL reliably and smoothly, and explain the RUL prediction results from the multi-sensor condition monitoring data collected under the non-fixed-length equipment operation cycle and multi-operating conditions. In this paper, a Multi-level Attention Graph feature Fusion Smooth Prognostics Approach (MAGF-SPA) is proposed to achieve accurate, smooth, and interpretable RUL prediction results. In this method, firstly, multivariate time series (MTS) are transformed into graph signals from a purely data-driven perspective. Secondly, the four-level feature extraction strategy, which includes node-level, subgraph-level, cyclical-level, and temporal-level feature extraction, is designed to extract the inherent hidden degradation characteristics of MTS. Finally, a smoothing trick proposed in this paper can optimise the RUL prediction value corresponding to the degradation characteristics in real time. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art on the N-CMAPSS dataset. © 2024 Northeastern University, China.",2-s2.0-85206934786,"multi - level attention graph feature fusion smooth prognostics approach aircraft engines remaining useful life prediction development prognostic health management system , challenge degradation characteristics , estimate rul reliably smoothly , explain rul prediction results multi - sensor condition monitoring data collected non - fixed - length equipment operation cycle multi - operating conditions . paper , multi - level attention graph feature fusion smooth prognostics approach ( magf - spa ) proposed achieve accurate , smooth , interpretable rul prediction results . method , firstly , multivariate time series ( mts ) transformed graph signals purely data - driven perspective . secondly , - level feature extraction strategy , includes node - level , subgraph - level , cyclical - level , temporal - level feature extraction , designed extract inherent hidden degradation characteristics mts . finally , smoothing trick proposed paper optimise rul prediction value corresponding degradation characteristics real time . experimental results proposed method achieves state - - - art n - cmapss dataset . © 2024 northeastern university , china ."
