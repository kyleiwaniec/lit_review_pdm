"Automatic Phase Sequence Detection in BLDC Motor Drives with Hall Sensors Brushless DC (BLDC) motors with hall effect sensors are one of the most common arrangements in electric vehicle drives, particularly in E-rickshaw type of applications. The drive operation is dependent on the hall sensor signals that correspond to particular rotor position in an electrical cycle. Each hall is placed in fixed spatial configuration against the three phase stator windings. Thus, hall signal pattern is fixed against fixed motor phase sequence in clockwise or counterclockwise rotation. This sequence locking is necessary for the drive operation. If correct sequencing is not used for connecting motor phase or hall terminals with controller terminals, the phase sequence detected by the controller is different from the actual sequence. The switching pattern implemented by the controller is incorrect in such a case. This paper presents a scheme for automatic phase detection and subsequent correction in controller without requiring physical reconnection of motor phase windings. © 2024 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85208470942
"Estimation of the equipment residual lifetime in major hazard industries by using a virtual sensor Prognostic is central in the management of components and production systems, structures and infrastructures. It aims estimating their health status and predicting residual useful lifetime, based on data and information related to degradation processes, the normal plant operability and the environmental conditions. Trustable estimates of the residual lifetime for systems allow achieving several goals, including a safe conduction of operations, an efficient operability that allows predictive maintenance actions and the extension of operational lifetime, under safety conditions. This point is particularly important in the context of the chemical and process industry, that is subject to the Seveso Directive. This normative recently imposed the plant operator to assess and manage equipment aging by redacting a detailed aging management plan. As a consequence, methods and tools are being developed for the assessment and management of deterioration mechanisms at major hazard industries. This paper presents the results related to the development of a virtual sensor for the estimation of the residual lifetime of the industrial equipment. In the initial version, the virtual sensor uses simplified models for the aging forecasting and information collected during audits and the equipment monitoring. Preliminary results of the implementation and testing of the initial version of the virtual sensor are shown by means of its application to a case-study.

"A Fault Diagnosability Evaluation Method for A Class of Affine Nonlinear Systems Considering Sensor Faults In the present study of fault diagnosability of nonlinear systems, the fault diagnosability of sensor fault is not considered. The paper considered the sensor fault and the fault diagnosability evaluation method for a class of affine nonlinear systems is proposed by using the theory of differential geometry. The diagnosability of faults is regarded as an inherent property of the system and does not change with the change of diagnostic methods. Based on the controllability and observability decomposition theorems, the controllability distribution and observability distribution of faults are defined, and then the detectability and isolability criteria between process faults and sensor faults are given based on the containment relationship between each distribution.

"A deep adversarial approach based on multisensor fusion for remaining useful life prognostics Multi-sensor systems are proliferating the asset management industry and by proxy, the structural health management community. Asset managers are beginning to require a prognostics and health management system to predict and assess maintenance decisions. These systems handle big machinery data and multi-sensor fusion and integrate remaining useful life prognostic capabilities. We introduce a deep adversarial learning approach to damage prognostics. A non-Markovian variation inference-based model incorporating an adversarial training algorithm framework was developed. The proposed framework was applied to a public multi-sensor data set of turbofan engines to demonstrate its ability to predict remaining useful life. We find that using the deep adversarial based approach results in higher performing remaining useful life predictions. © 2019 European Safety and Reliability Association.

"Actuator Load Estimation From Distributed Optical Sensing of Airframe Deformation Real-time health monitoring of flight control actuators usually involves the comparison of measured signals either with numerical models or with statistical data. As the external loads experienced by the system influence the operation of most actuators, such loads are a useful quantity to compare with the actuator output and perform on-board fault detection. In common flight controls, the actuator load is not directly available as a measured signal, due to the reliability and complexity penalties often associated to the installation of dedicated sensors and transducers. In this work, we discuss the use of distributed sensing of the airframe strain to infer the aerodynamic loads acting on the flight control actuator. We address a specific sensing technology based on Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBGs) as it combines a good accuracy with minimal invasivity and low complexity. Specifically, we combined a structural and an aerodynamic model to collect a database to train data-driven surrogates intended to map from strain measures to actuator load.

"Estimating the remaining useful life of a flow distribution system Flow distribution systems (FDS) are widely used in many industrial processes when it is necessary to distribute products in several ways and then to collect them into one or several discharge destinations, such as water supply, heat supply, electricity supply network, etc. The maintenance decisions on a flow distribution system are challenging because the degradation of individual components is independent and not fully detectable. It can lead to inaccurate diagnostic and prognostic results. Industrial systems are often equipped with multiple sensors on each component to collect the efficient information that helps computing the remaining life of the system (RUL). As multiple data are captured, it is a multiple outputs system. This paper proposes an Input-Output Hidden Markov Model (IOHMM) for RUL assessment to maintenance aid decision making of a multi-component flow distribution system. The components are considered independently for the diagnostic and prognostic of their health conditions and thus of the system. The goal of this paper is to find the best path to know the health conditions of the components for supplying the demand to the destination. The study offers an optimal solution in two steps to keep the system alive longer while it can fulfil customer needs. The first step is the independent monitoring of all components to determine the most appropriate supply planning strategy. The second step is to identify all the possible routes where the flow gets through different components for discharging to the destinations. This aims to benefit such as the alternative flow paths or maintenance activities at the system level. The operating conditions are considered as inputs for each of the components independently. © ESREL2020-PSAM15 Organizers. Published by Research Publishing, Singapore.",2-s2.0-85107271596
"High integrity multi-sensor navigation system for safety critical applications The high increase of safety critical applications such as autonomous driving, Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS), Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) and many applications that can cause human or economic losses pose a significant challenge of navigation integrity. Although the integrity concept is not new, a major challenge in these applications is to ensure both high accuracy and high integrity in very challenging environments. In response to the high requirements of these applications, this paper will present a high integrity multi-sensor navigation system specially designed for safety critical applications. The system is composed of a MEMS Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), a multi-constellation multi-frequency GNSS receiver and an odometer communicating via a CAN bus. A tightly coupled solution [1] based on an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) has been developed by SBG-Systems to fuse all these sensors to deliver a high accuracy and availability especially in complex environments where satellites signals are prone to attenuation or even unavailability. In addition, advanced vehicle modeling and constraints [2] have been added with respect to the motion profile to provide a navigation solution for the targeted applications. The integrity management starts with the correction service such as the State Space Representation Corrections (SSR) [3]; many services now provide SSR corrections over the world with integrity messages. Another challenging aspect of robust navigation is the integration of an Advanced Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (ARAIM) [4], which can be defined as a two steps process. First, a Fault Detection and Exclusion (FDE) is performed, then if a consistent solution is found the Protection Levels (PL) are calculated [5]. The system will assure a continuous monitoring of multiple integrity indicator, the PL will be computed and compared to an Alert Limit (AL) threshold to notify the user about system availability. During the GNSS outages, the INS and the odometer not only keep the precision of the position solution, but also scale and propagate the PL using the inertial models [6]. This paper also focuses on the integrity assessment of the developed system. Indeed, an extensive test campaign has been conducted to evaluate the maturity of the technology and its compliance with autonomous vehicles requirements. Several ranges of products and configurations are tested to measure the performance driving factors and evaluate the typical use case. © 2021 Proceedings of the 34th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation, ION GNSS+ 2021.

"Online framework of prognostic and health management for cmg under multiphysics Control moment gyroscope (CMG) is the key actuator of satellite and it is critical for monitoring health condition and maintenance. However, there are three challenges in health management. Firstly, the environment where a CMG works is complex and is hard to be decomposed into the receiver and the affected, which brings difficulty to estimate the performance of CMG. Secondly, because of design requirement and installation cost, the vibration sensor, which is regarded as a key health indication other industrial background, is unavailable. Finally, missing data is a big data with unconnected base stations for transforming collected sensor data, decreasing the accuracy of online CMG health condition estimation and rest useful life (RUL) prediction. To face these challenges, this paper proposed a system framework of prognostic and health management considering environment. The contributions in this paper include: 1) introducing a relationship between temperature, current and speed of high-speed bearing to depict the degeneration process. 2) considering the environmental effect on system and designing a duel-flow deep learning model to detect abnormal time serial data. 3) proposing a workflow before data training for estimate missing data. 4) Describing software architecture for spacecraft diagnostics and health management.

"Fail-Aware Concept for Autonomous Driving Cars Condition monitoring is getting increased attention in the automotive industry. Especially the development of autonomous driving cars requires information about the health status of a vehicle. Not a driver but the car itself has to react on a fault autonomously. Cars have to be built in a way that they are fail-safe, fail-operational, and fail-aware. This affects their architectures, the modules and subsystems used, and the semiconductors that are selected. The idea of the fail-aware concept is to detect degeneration of a device and act before a failure occurs. This turns a potential failure into a maintenance action. Fail-aware reflects the health status of a device and is part of a prognostics and health management (PHM) system. In order to detect drift of electrical parameters of semiconductor devices, we use data from stress tests, like the high temperature operating life test1 (HTOL). At the HTOL test devices are electrically tested, then put to stress, tested again, and put to stress again. This is repeated until the required stress time is completed. We use the data from these electrical tests and correct them for tester offsets and for the measurement uncertainty2 . The drift is calculated for each device individually. We model the drift itself as a normally distributed random variable. In that way we are able to calculate the likelihood of a device to drift outside the specification limits during operation and the remaining useful life (RUL). As a example, an angle sensor may show some drift. This drift can be tracked in the autonomous driving car and the RUL can be calculated. On higher system levels data driven tools are used, like the weakness monitor3 . Such health status information can be made available via the on-board diagnostics system of an autonomous driving vehicle. © ESREL 2021.

"Digital Twin Based Health Monitoring of DC-AC Inverter: A Review This article summarizes the state of digital twin-based health monitoring for DC-AC inverters. When used in conjunction with a real-life DC-AC inverter, a digital twin creates an exact replica of the system in question.

"A Method for Detecting Gradient Coil Cooling Faults for Magnetic Resonance Imaging This paper proposes a method for monitoring and diagnosing cooling system faults in the gradient coils of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In fact, cooling system fault can potentially lead to significant imaging deviations. Hence, a Hash Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (LCMAC) is devised to learn the normal characteristics of gradient coils. When cooling failure affects the gradient coils' performance, the LCMAC response deviates from the norm. Additionally, two characteristic variables, degradation index, and waveform index, are introduced for residual error analysis. Notably, this approach offers the advantage of not requiring the dismantling of the MRI equipment's outer casing or the addition of extra sensors. Moreover, an alternative strategy is formulated to identify degradation types and estimate their severity. Testing a typical gradient coil under five fault conditions in the air conditioning unit validates the effectiveness and robustness of this strategy. © 2024 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85200395618

Then, ET mechanisms are designed on the basis of the filters gains, and an ET FDI scheme is constructed. Different from the existing results, the influence of sensor faults on the output space is considered, and the gains of the designed filters in the absence of ET mechanisms are still applicable after the ET mechanisms are introduced, while the ones in the existing results need to be redesigned.

"Robust Sensor Fault Detection for Linear Parameter-Varying Systems using Interval Observer This paper proposes a new interval observer for continuous-time linear parameter-varying systems with an unmeasurable parameter vector subject to unknown but bounded disturbances. The parameter-varying matrices are assumed to be elementwise bounded. This observer is used to compute a so-called residual interval used for sensor fault detection by checking if zero is contained in the interval. To attenuate the effect of the system’s uncertainties on the detectability of faults, additional weighting matrices and different upper and lower observer gains are introduced, providing more degrees of freedom than the classical interval observer strategies. In addition, a L∞ procedure is proposed to tune the value of the observer gains, this procedure being easy to modify to introduce additional constraints on the estimation algorithm.

"Wireless Monitoring of Gearbox Vibrations with Embedded Sensors Using LabVIEW The development of sensor monitoring systems for rotating machinery is important in automating industrial machine monitoring. Traditionally, the primary method for monitoring rotating machinery involved wired sensors such as accelerometers that were attached to the housing of the component under operation. However, this approach has a limitation since it cannot capture vibrations from the rotating part underneath the housing. Vibration measurements are crucial for machine health monitoring and analysis. Wireless vibration monitoring offers many benefits over wired monitoring. Thus, we implemented a wireless monitoring system using an embedded system design as a reliable option. A wireless monitoring system based on MEMS accelerometers with 3-axis digital outputs was used to measure vibrations ranging from -10 g to 10 g and temperature in a range from 0 to +70 °C. The system used the IEEE 802.11 wireless communication protocol and ESP modules. All the sensors were connected to a microcontroller and integrated into a printed circuit board, and the signals, data logging, and alarms were integrated into a PC platform using National Instruments LabVIEW software. The proposed monitoring system was embedded in a planetary gearbox to test its capabilities. The experimental results showed that the proposed wireless monitoring system could monitor gearbox vibrations in real-time, rendering data in the time domain, frequency domain, and root mean square.

"A Design of Ultra-High Definition Dual-Lens Optical System with Long Back Focal Length Inspired by the human visual system, the dual-lens optical system emulates the binocular stereoscopic vision. It captures two perspectives of the same scene from separate viewpoints, creating a sense of depth and a three-dimensional effect. Currently, research progress has been made in the design of dual-lens optical systems in terms of zooming and baseline variation, but there are still issues such as limited field of view and a narrow range of baseline variation. To overcome these limitations and extend the working distance of the system while ensuring image quality, this paper proposes a design method for an ultra-high definition dual-lens optical system with an extended rear stopping distance. This study first compares three traditional binocular stereoscopic imaging techniques (dual-lens dual-sensor, single-lens single-sensor, dual-lens single-sensor), analyzes the shortcomings of the current dual-lens optical system design, and proposes an improvement plan to increase the rear working distance of the system. Based on retaining some of the imaging advantages of the existing dual-lens single-sensor optical system, this study explores the possibility of achieving a long rear focal length and a compact volume by introducing an inverted telephoto structure. In the design process, the two optical paths are completely identical and mirror-symmetrical. This paper first designs a suitable initial structure for one of the optical paths and evaluates and optimizes the image quality. After the image quality meets the requirements, the dual-lens optical system is combined using multiple configurations in ZEMAX software to determine the final system structure. The focus of this study's design is on the inverted telephoto optical system, which adopts an asymmetric structure composed of positive and negative lens groups. The negative lens group reduces the field of view of the off-axis light to the positive group, achieving a wide-angle effect, while the positive lens group ensures that the image is formed on the designated working image plane, thus achieving a long working distance. This study is conducted on ZEMAX software, aiming to achieve an optical system with a rear working distance greater than 50mm and a focal length between 105-150mm, and analyzes the image quality, including the optical point spread function (PSF), modulation transfer function (MTF), spherical aberration, distortion, etc. The evaluation and analysis results of this study show that the image quality of the optical system is good, but further efforts are still needed to achieve good imaging over a wider field of view. © 2024 SPIE.",2-s2.0-85214027061

"Wireless sensor node powered by piezoelectric vibration energy harvester for vibrational mode identification and structural health monitoring We applied our previously developed wireless sensor node (WSN), which is powered by a piezoelectric vibration energy harvester (VEH), to structural health monitoring and verified its classification performance. The self-powered WSN can measure structural vibrations and transmit the three-axis acceleration waveform data wirelessly. A normal intact beam and four beams that had a single notch cut at four different locations were prepared for classification testing. The WSN, which was connected to the piezoelectric VEH, was mounted on the tip of an aluminum alloy beam, and a random vibration was then applied to the clamped end of the beam. First, the power of the piezoelectric VEH under the random vibration condition was investigated by introducing the probability of harvesting. The beam's vibrational modes were identified within the 0-1,600 Hz frequency range using the transmitted waveform data. Second, based on an analogy to 2D image classification, we created an input image by arranging the x, y, z-axis acceleration spectrum data vertically and then classifying the arranged data using 2D convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) layers. The Bayesian optimization technique was used to maximize classification accuracy by optimizing the hyperparameters.

Furthermore, the introduction of real in-process measuring systems in laser material processing like OCT has significantly increased the safety of both defect detection and process control [5][6][7][8][9]. The focus of this contribution, however, relates to the use of artificial intelligence algorithms to ""See New Things"". We will discuss how classified, physical properties can be derived from already reliable process information - ""seeing the unseen"", so to speak. Instead of defining complex rules for algorithms, the use of Data Science and Machine Learning methods reveals hidden structures in noisy unstructured data and make it possible to find the relationships of the data to the physical measurement. There are several systems available in the market which capture or measure and analyze physical effects of the process zone and their properties during the laser processing, but none of these effects and properties stand for “seam quality” for themselves, which is typically defined by mechanical, geometrical and metallurgical properties of the solidified seam. The process properties like emitted visible and thermal radiation or geometrical values of the melt pool or the penetration depth of the laser forming the keyhole (penetration depth) only provide indications of how the desired quality might be achieved. When welding thousands of seams per shift during serial production for Li-Ion batteries in e-mobiles, very often users would like to stop their fully automatic machines once the laser process is suddenly running out of previously set boundaries. Such an approach allows users to find systematic faults where and when they occur, rather than at the end of the line where quality inspection takes place and the line is still running, producing more and more parts with the same faults. When it comes to the use of artificial intelligence algorithms the following questions must be answered: ‧ Is it possible to map an input time series to a real value? ‧ Can we get out the strength of the weld from the process emissions? ‧ Is the information buried in the signal? The vision, which can be represented by Figure 1, is that by using the data from process emissions and specific data models, a relationship to physical quantities can be established. Thus, AI goes a significant step beyond the simple ""good-bad"" statement. © 2023 SPIE.",2-s2.0-85159788015

"Abnormal Automated Guided Vehicles Detection for Fleet Management Systems: A Reputation-based Distributed Velocity Estimation Approach Fleet management systems usually require many automated guided vehicles (AGVs) work together to carry out one specific task.

"Refrigerated Showcase Fault Detection by an Autoencoder with the Adaptive Kernel Size Tuning using Maximum Correntropy Criterion This paper proposes refrigerated showcase fault detection by an autoencoder with the adaptive kernel size tuning (AKST) using Maximum Correntropy Criterion (MCC) and Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum. Refrigerated showcase data may include outliers that store values differing from actual values because of various reasons such as incorrect sensor settings and radio frequency interference. The conventional fault detection methods by an autoencoder using Least Square Error (LSE) as a loss function are affected by the outliers when the outliers are included in learning data. On the contrary, the conventional fault detection methods by an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using MCC as a loss function can ignore influence of the outliers. Moreover, faults rarely occur in refrigerated showcases. The methods by an ANN using MCC require fault data for learning. A fault detection method by an autoencoder using the MCC that is a combination of the above two methods can ignore influence of the outliers and doesn't require fault data. However, there is a parameter named kernel size in the MCC. It is required to tune the parameter properly and the parameter tuning requires engineering. The proposed AKST method reduces the engineering of the kernel size tuning. Effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by comparison with comparative methods by an autoencoder using LSE and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), an autoencoder with fixed kernel size using the MCC and SGD, an autoencoder with the AKST using the MCC and Adam, and an autoencoder with the AKST using the MCC and AdaGrad. © 2022 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85147796958

"LSTM-based fatigue monitoring of fiberglass composites using laser-induced graphene This study aims to advance the field of composite material fatigue prognosis by employing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks for in-situ damage progression monitoring under random dynamic loading conditions. A unique approach is adopted, wherein Laser-Induced Graphene (LIG) interlayers are embedded into fiberglass composites. These LIG interlayers are innovative sensors owing to their piezoresistive properties, enabling real-time measurement of fatigue damage monitoring. The crux of this research lies in applying LSTM neural networks, specifically designed to handle time-series data, making them ideal for modeling the stochastic and unpredictable nature of fatigue loading in composite materials. Contrasting the performance of LSTM with traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), it is observed that LSTM yields superior prediction accuracy in estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of LIG interlayered fiberglass composites. By utilizing predefined electrical resistance damage parameters, the LSTM algorithm correlates the rate of fatigue damage buildup to the impending decline in mechanical performance. This research establishes that integrating piezoresistive LIG interlayers with LSTM neural networks culminates in a robust, reliable, and closed-loop system for structural fatigue monitoring and lifecycle prediction in composite materials subjected to random dynamic loading.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

"Multi-scale and multi-view fusion based state space model for bridge health monitoring sensor fault diagnosis As bridge infrastructure ages and load increases, Bridge Health Monitoring Systems (BHMS) have become increasingly important. Sensors play a crucial role in BHMS, but sensor failures may result in inaccurate data, thereby reducing the reliability of the monitoring system. Due to the interference from the vehicles on the bridge, current bridge sensor fault detection algorithms cannot detect the faults of sensors accurately.

"Health Estimation and Fault Prediction of the Sensors of a HVAC System Due to ageing or adverse environment, the sensors of an HVAC system deteriorate progressively and fail to produce the desired output after sometime.

"Fusion of experiments and simulations for real-time identification of pipeline defects Natural gas pipelines are critical infrastructure assets that require robust and continuous health monitoring to ensure safe and reliable operations. This paper presents an intelligent monitoring approach using fiber optic acoustic sensors based on a hybrid dataset comprising both real third-party intrusion and simulated guided wave signals. A 16-ft pipeline with inherent defects served as the test bed, where guided wave propagation experiments were conducted using a collar exciter at 32 kHz and a specialized single mode-multi mode-single mode (SMS) fiber optic acoustic sensor to detect signal responses. In parallel, third-party intrusion events were artificially generated via a speaker simulating various acoustic events, further broadening the dataset. The resulting data consisted of approximately 20 unique events, each played for 10 seconds twice. A physics-based guided wave simulation model was developed to replicate defects with varying dimensions and locations, producing a suite of virtual signals. Combining the experimentally measured and simulated signals yielded a robust hybrid dataset for advanced signal classification and regression. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was employed to classify events into physical defects versus non-physical intrusion signatures. Subsequently, for the classified physical defect signals, an XGBoost regressor was utilized to estimate defect variables (e.g., depth, length) and their positions within the pipeline. Results indicate that the proposed pipeline monitoring framework, enabled by fiber optic acoustic sensing and machine learning models, offers high accuracy in detecting and characterizing defects. This integrated approach can thus serve as an effective method for predictive maintenance, minimizing downtime and enhancing safety in natural gas pipeline operations.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

"Feasibility of in-situ health monitoring for composite structure with embedded piezoelectric sensor networks Continuous Inspection and maintenance of high performing modern structural composite structures are essential to ensure the safety and efficiency of the any industry. Unlike conventional metals, the damage of fibre-reinforced polymer matrix composite materials that are commonly used in structural components is relatively difficult to detect, given the various micro-constituents present. Especially, carbon fiber-reinforced polymer and glass fiber-reinforced polymer laminate can produce no-visible surface damage while sustaining internal delamination and fiber failures upon experiencing Low-Velocity Impact (LVI) forces. Barely Visible Impact Damage (BVID) is one of important damages that is tedious to detect with non-destructive methods as the damage location and intensity is unknown to the operator unless detected using Non-Destructive Techniques (NDT). Therefore, Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is an active system that provides constant surveillance of the component's vitals in operating conditions, thereby reducing the structural Meant Time To Repair (MTTR). In this work, piezoelectric based sensors are embedded into a composite laminate with electrical cables for voltage detection under LVI impacts. Experiments were conducted with an array of sensors at various locations. The measured signals are analyzed for their amplitude with reference to the embedded location to determine the damage intensity and impact location. A Machine Learning (ML) model is developed to provide a predictive method for SHM of the composite structure for impact damage. Besides, mechanical tests are also conducted to prove the compatibility of the embedded sensors in the host structure in order to check for the knock down in the safety factor of the component due to the presence of a foreign object in the material system.

"A Hybrid Active-Passive Approach to Imbalanced Nonstationary Data Stream Classification In real-world applications, the process generating the data might suffer from nonstationary effects (e.g., due to seasonality, faults affecting sensors or actuators, and changes in the users' behaviour). These changes, often called concept drift, might induce severe (potentially catastrophic) impacts on trained learning models that become obsolete over time, and inadequate to solve the task at hand. Learning in presence of concept drift aims at designing machine and deep learning models that are able to track and adapt to concept drift. Typically, techniques to handle concept drift are either active or passive, and traditionally, these have been considered to be mutually exclusive. Active techniques use an explicit drift detection mechanism, and re-train the learning algorithm when concept drift is detected. Passive techniques use an implicit method to deal with drift, and continually update the model using incremental learning. Differently from what present in the literature, we propose a hybrid alternative which merges the two approaches, hence, leveraging on their advantages.

"Remaining Useful Life Prediction Based on Hybrid Convolutional Neural Networks and Multi-Layer Perceptron Remaining useful life prediction has been an important task for Prognostics and Health Management systems. Accurate monitoring of mechanical equipment conditions requires the coordinated operation of a large number of sensors. During the degradation monitoring process of mechanical equipment, there exists a potential correlation among sensors. Existing deep learning-based methods often only utilize CNN as a feature extractor, making it difficult to capture spatial correlations among different sensors, and the simultaneous use of recurrent neural networks for Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction leads to longer training durations and susceptibility to issues such as vanishing or exploding gradients.

"Dielectric elastomer sensors adapted for monitoring compression load of clamped battery cells Condition monitoring of Li-ion cells in battery packs for electric vehicles is becoming increasingly important, not only in terms of safety, but also with respect to predictive maintenance and recycling applications of the battery. Parameters already monitored by the battery management system are the pack temperature and electrical properties such as cell voltage and current flow. The compression load in a stacked battery pack, which changes not only during charging and discharging but also during aging, would provide valuable information about the health condition of the cell. This work shows the development of a dielectric elastomer sensor (DES) system especially adapted for monitoring the compression load of clamped Li-ion cells. By attaching special elastomer-based structures on both sides of an elastomer film, a thin and soft compression load sensor is realized. Various sensor configurations were investigated in order to increase the sensor performance in the required pressure range of the battery cell. The sensor design was varied by using different structures or by modifying the elastomer material or the electrodes of the intermediate elastomer film. The sensor characterization was performed by applying a controlled compression load and simultaneously recording the capacitance signals of the sensor. First cycling experiments using a sensor array in a clamped setup with the battery cell showed that the sensor capacitance depends on the compression load as the cell is charged and discharged. This result demonstrates the great potential in the field of condition monitoring of Li-ion battery cells. © 2023 SPIE.",2-s2.0-85173802557

"CA-TimeMixer based action recognition and scoring Action recognition and scoring have important application value in health monitoring, sports analysis, and physical education. With the development of wearable devices and sensor technology, sensor sequences based action recognition and scoring have become a hot research topic. However, the complexity and individual differences of action sequences require recognition models to have high generalization. In addition, the key features in action sensor sequence data are often sparse. It is challenging to combine the global features and local details for collaborative analysis. To address these challenges, a novel action recognition and scoring method CA-TimeMixer based on contrastive learning and TimeMixer is proposed in this paper. In terms of model architecture, the Past Decomposable Mixing (PDM) of TimeMixer is employed for feature extraction. Cross Attention (CA) is introduced to fuse different scaled features of the sensor sequences, thereby enhancing the model's ability to extract local-global features. A supervised contrastive loss is adopted to perform contrastive learning on sequence samples of different actions for action recognition. During inference, the feature similarity between the test sample and the benchmark action sequence is computed to determine whether the category of test sample is the same with the benchmark action. For the action scoring, the test sequence and the benchmark sequence are input into CA-TimeMixer. The difference tensor of these two features predicts a score with a linear layer. Comparative experiments and ablation studies were conducted on the collected Taichi action sequence dataset. Compared with the benchmark models, the proposed CA-TimeMixer achieves Accuracy of 94.7% in action recognition and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.36 in action scoring.

An Intelligent System for Bearing Fault Identification based on Gramian Multi-Resolution Dynamic Mode Decomposition This work introduces a single sensor intelligent end-to-end framework for fault detection based on Gramian-multi-resolution dynamic mode decomposition (GMrDMD). Vibration signals are transformed using gram matrix followed by spatial temporal decomposition based on multi-resolution dynamic mode decomposition (MrDMD).

Accurate data from these sensors is required to avoid collisions and catastrophic events in actual situations. Redundant sensors are often used in mission critical sensors to mitigate both unexpected failures and cyberattacks. Redundant sensors double or triple the sensor system cost without giving the user information about which sensor is faulty in real-time. We developed a method that exploits small sensor-to-sensor variations; thereby fingerprinting them. For this purpose, we designed circuitry measuring a TMCS1101A4 magnetic current sensor pair.

At room temperature, a degassing time of 25 min can achieve an oil-gas equilibrium of 82%. After correction using the Oswald coefficient, the prototype's minimum detection limit for acetylene in oil was determined to be 0.12 mL·L-1. This device is easy to install and adjust, doesn't require many electromagnetic valves, is compact in size, and is suitable for multi-channel parallel integration. Its detection cycle is less than 30 minutes. In the event of a sudden change in acetylene concentration in the oil, it can respond with over 90% accuracy within 30 minutes. © 2024 SPIE.",2-s2.0-85184664741
"Optical frequency domain reflectometry vibration sensing based on fiber bragg grating Vibration detection and analysis can provide raw data for early detection, diagnosis, and prevention of mechanical faults. Meanwhile, fiber Bragg grating(FBG) sensors offer advantages such as strong anti-interference capability, high precision, and high signal-to-noise ratio compared to traditional electro-mechanical sensors. Addressing the limitation of traditional fiber optic grating-based vibration sensing systems, which is constrained by the Nyquist theorem, an FBG-based OFDR vibration sensing system is proposed. Leveraging the Doppler effect, this system achieves the capability of measuring high vibration frequencies at low repetition rates. Additionally, an adaptive orthogonal demodulation algorithm is introduced to mitigate the spectral broadening issue caused by the non-negligible grating length. Experimental results demonstrate that this system can measure vibration frequencies as high as 30 kHz with a repetition rate of 10 Hz. Comparative analyses between experimental and simulated data validate the performance advantages of the proposed demodulation algorithm. © 2024 SPIE.",2-s2.0-85203109335
"Advancements of the ELT M1 Figure Control Loop: Edge Sensor Fault Detection and Management of Actuator Non-Linearities in a Large MIMO System The primary mirror of ESO's Extremely Large Telescope contains 798 hexagonal segments, which are equipped with position actuators (PACT) for segment piston-tip-tilt actuation and edge sensors (ES) to measure the relative segment displacements. PACT and ES are used for M1 figure control, i.e. for maintaining the reference shape of the primary mirror. Due to the sheer number of used sensors (4524), ES failures cannot be excluded. In order to minimize the influence of such failures on observations, an automated approach for ES failure handling has been developed. Besides identification of one or more malfunctioning sensors, replacement values for the erroneous sensor signals are calculated and fed back into the figure loop, enabling uninterrupted observations. The figure loop position actuators are hybrid actuators, combining brushless DC motors for a large range of motion with Piezo actuators for high accuracy and fast settling. Motions larger than the Piezo range (∼ 10µm) are restricted to a maximum velocity of 100µm/s. Since the figure loop is controlled in modal space such a rate limit introduces non-linearities in this large Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) system resulting in cross-coupling of modes and undesirable transient behavior. A custom management scheme for MIMO systems with actuator non-linearities has been developed and successfully tested. It minimizes overshoots and cross-coupling between modes during transitions considering the PACT velocity limitation. In addition, this scheme simplifies closure of the figure loop from any initial condition. This paper covers advancements in both areas. After a brief description of the relevant subsystems, the algorithm to detect faulty ES is introduced. The closely related calculation of ideal replacement values is shown and simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the Fault Detection, Isolation & Recovery (FDIR) measures for the ELT M1. Then the theory of considering actuator non-linearities in large MIMO systems is introduced. A custom scheme is derived and applied to the ELT M1 Figure Loop. Simulation results and measurements taken with ESO's seven segment M1 Test Facility are presented. © 2024 SPIE.",2-s2.0-85201960994

"Autonomous Vehicle Development and Navigation on Lane-Less Roads Using Enhanced Lane Detection Techniques Self-driving technology is evolving day by day as numerous modern vehicles strive to incorporate some degree of automation. Safety, ease of driving, affordable traveling, reduced road congestion and minimized fuel emissions are some of the key benefits offered by self-driving technology. Self driving cars are still a far-fledged goal in developing countries like India, owing to poor road conditions, little or no lane markings, higher level of disorderliness on roads and improper traffic management.

"Can a deep learning based IoT fault diagnosis system identify more than one fault at a time? The experiments in this study propose a fault diagnosis method to incorporate in an internet-of-things (IoT) system for the condition monitoring of high-voltage generating stations. The approach is based on feature extraction with signal processing methods and a deep learning model to tackle fault classification in measured signals that contain one or more faults simultaneously. The proposed system implements feature extraction through the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) of 1-D electro-magnetic interference (EMI) fault signals obtained from online high-voltage (HV) assets.

"Model Aggregation for Virtual Metrology in High-Volume Manufacturing Virtual metrology (VM) plays a pivotal role in enhancing productivity, improving quality, and reducing maintenance costs in semiconductor manufacturing by replacing traditional physical metrology. Many implementations of VM rely on the predictive modeling approach that leverages equipment sensor data to estimate crucial process outcome variables. Despite its inherent advantages, VM has not been deployed widely in actual manufacturing processes due to the lack of accuracy and scalability. Most machine learning algorithms struggle to effectively address practical challenges such as data drift, data shift, sparse ground-truth data, and inconsistent data quality prevalent in semiconductor manufacturing processes. To address these limitations, we introduce the aggregated adaptive online model (AggAOM), a novel approach that effectively tackles the challenge of data scarcity in VM. By leveraging the hierarchical structure of manufacturing equipment, AggAOM captures and utilizes the underlying commonalities among equipment chambers within the same hierarchy besides their individual variations. This methodology enables more efficient use of limited data and substantially improves the prediction accuracy of VM running in mega-fabs for high-volume manufacturing. We present the experimental results by utilizing the datasets collected from SK hynix over nine months and demonstrate that AggAOM outperforms existing models significantly in accuracy.

"Comparing Life-cycle Dynamics of Li-Ion Batteries (LIBs) Clustered by Operating Conditions with SINDy Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) play a big part in the vision of a net-zero emission economy, yet it is commonly reported that only a small percentage of LIBs are recycled worldwide. An outstanding barrier to making recycling LIBs economical throughout the supply chain pertains to the uncertainty surrounding their remaining useful life (RUL). How do operating conditions impact initial useful life of the battery? We applied sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics method (SINDy) to understand the life-cycle dynamics of LIBs with respect to sensor data observed for current, voltage, internal resistance and temperature.

"Maximize the Production Process by Using a Novel Hybrid Model to Predict the Failure of Machine The widespread availability of sensing technology, such as detectors, has led to the generation of enormous volumes of time-series data by equipment in manufacturing warehouses and industries. There is a ton of knowledge accessible that may be put to use in order to forecast the failure of machinery and the decline of its quality in a particular plant. The downtime of manufacturing machinery is responsible for significant monetary losses, which may be mitigated by accurately predicting when the system will cease to function by analyzing sensor data. Actual data collection from sensors is now technically viable because to the advances that went into creating the Internet of Things (IoT). Our research has shown that combination research has the potential to provide reliable estimates since it is able to accurately represent the abstract features that are essential to the development of more consistent reading. This makes hybrid modeling a useful tool. In addition, it might be challenging to establish an efficient optimization approach due to the complicated nature of the many sensor data that is seen in real-time circumstances. A technique for nonlinear time prediction for predictive maintenance (PdM) is proposed in this study. The method utilizes a combination of convolution operation, extended memory recall, and skips connections (CNN-LSTM). For the purpose of predicting when machines may break down, we try out several forecasting methods, one at a time, including CNN, LSTM, and CNNLSTM. The data were taken from the case study conducted by Microsoft and utilized in this research. The database contains information on the history of breakdowns, the service background, the error circumstances, as well as the machinery attributes and telemetry, which includes information such as the output power, stress, motion, and roster accelerometer gathered during years 2015 and 2016.

"FTC: A Universal Sensor for Fault Injection Attack Detection Over the past two decades, fault-injection methods have evolved into very effective attacks to cause integrity or con-fidentiality violations in integrated circuits or electronic systems. Fault-injection attacks (FIAs) can be carried out using clock-glitch, voltage glitch, laser, optical instruments, electromagnetic (EM) emanation, and more. One promising solution to detect FIAs is to use on-chip sensors to capture the attacks' effect. However, having different types and techniques of FIAs enforces using the custom-designed sensors for each type of attack, which is challenging and introduces a large overhead. To address this, in this paper, we propose to develop a universal Fault-to- Time Converter (FTC) sensor that can effectively detect all the above-mentioned FIAs while requiring minimal overhead. The FTC sensor converts the effect of faults injected by an FIA method into 'time' that is measurable. Then, the 'time' difference can be analyzed further to identify whether an attack has been carried out successfully. Our FTC sensor implementation in FPGA platforms demonstrates that the design can effectively differentiate various FIA attack scenarios with its encoded output. The FTC sensor can also be extended to cover other fault attacks that have a similar impact on the victim device (i.e., affecting circuit timing).  © 2022 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85136420789

"Federated Learning for Distributed Spectrum Sensing in NextG Communication Networks NextG networks are intended to provide the flexibility of sharing the spectrum with incumbent users and support various spectrum monitoring tasks such as anomaly detection, fault diagnostics, user equipment identification, and authentication. For that purpose, a network of wireless sensors is needed to monitor the spectrum for signal transmissions of interest over a large deployment area. Each sensor receives signals under a specific channel condition depending on its location and trains an individual model of a deep neural network accordingly to classify signals. To improve the accuracy, individual sensors may exchange sensing data or sensor results with each other or with a fusion center (such as in cooperative spectrum sensing). In this paper, distributed federated learning over a multi-hop wireless network is considered to collectively train a deep neural network for signal identification. In distributed federated learning, each sensor broadcasts its trained model to its neighbors, collects the deep neural network models from its neighbors, and aggregates them to initialize its own model for the next round of training. Without exchanging any spectrum data, this process is repeated over time such that a common deep neural network is built across the network while preserving the privacy associated with signals collected at different locations. Signal classification accuracy and convergence time are evaluated for different network topologies (including line, star, ring, grid, and random networks) and packet loss events. In addition, the reduction of communication overhead and energy consumption is considered with random participation of sensors in model updates. The results show the feasibility of extending cooperative spectrum sensing over a general multi-hop wireless network through federated learning and indicate the robustness of federated learning to wireless network effects, thereby sustaining high accuracy with low communication overhead and energy consumption. © 2022 SPIE.",2-s2.0-85143390207
"In-line inspecting device for leak detection from gas-filled food packages A device based on non-dispersive infrared spectroscopy has been developed for leak testing through non-invasive evaluation of escaping carbon dioxide (CO2) outside of Modified-Atmosphere-Packed (MAP) cheese containers. The targeted samples are bags of processed mozzarella sealed in modified atmosphere at the end of the manufacturing process, in which the internal CO2 concentration is higher than 10% vol. for product shelf-life extension. The device performs in-line measurement on moving samples on a conveyor belt with the application of a calibrated test pressure to the samples to stimulate leaks through any possible package defect such as holes, cuts, wrinkles and swelling in the seal. The sensor device takes advantage of a multichannel suction manifold and an array of high-speed, optical non-dispersive CO2 sensors for a space-resolved sensing of any leaked carbon dioxide around the sample perimeter. Any variation in the detected carbon dioxide level when compared with ambient background is correlated with a faulty package. Moreover, the device is able to report and log an approximate fault location and automatically remove the defective package from the production line. © 2020 SPIE.",2-s2.0-85087914163

"Fatigue crack prognosis of lifting-lug by nonlinear ultrasonic modulation For a metallic component, prediction of a remaining useful life (RUL) is of extreme importance to prevent a sudden failure of the structure. If a fatigue crack exists, the nonlinear interaction of a low frequency pumping wave (LF) and a high frequency probing wave (HF) generates additional responses at the frequencies equal to the sum and difference of the input frequencies. In this study, the nonlinear ultrasonic modulation is used for fatigue crack prognosis of the lifting-lug that connects a tension cable. Nonlinear ultrasonic modulation components are used to define a fatigue index. The functional relationship between fatigue index and the number of loading cycles is established based on Paris-Erdogan theories. Then, by curve fitting of the established function to the fatigue index values obtained at various loading cycles, the RUL corresponding to a fatigue index is estimated from the fitted function. The proposed RUL estimation method is associated with the following advantages: (1) the fatigue index is defined as a function of nonlinear ultrasonic modulation components, (2) the functional relationship between fatigue index and loading cycles is established for lifting-lug structure, and (3) online remaining useful life is predicted and updated using sequentially measured ultrasonic signals. To validate the proposed method, the lifting-lug specimen is used and subjected to cyclic loading. The experiment is conducted using surface-mounted piezoelectric sensors for ultrasonic signal excitation and measurement.

Among various power cables, XLPE insulated power cables have become a major variety of high-voltage power cables and have received widespread attention in recent years because of excellent electrical properties, good mechanical properties, good heat resistance, and simple structures. The maximum long-term operating temperature is 90 ., . Once the temperature is exceeded for a long time, the aging will be accelerated and the life will be greatly reduced. It is found through testing that if the cables overheat, ethylene gas will be emitted. Therefore, if the ethylene gas sensor is used, the cable status can be effectively monitored in a timely manner and faults can be found to ensure the safety and long-term stability of the cable. This paper mainly studies the hydrothermal synthesis of nano-flower NiO and its detection of ethylene gas generated during the operation of XLPE power cables. A simple nano-flower NiO was synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method. NiO is prepared as ethylene gas sensor, and the experimental results show that its gas sensing performance is better. From the analysis of the experimental results, it can be seen that the detection limit of nano flower-shaped NiO to ethylene is low and the response value is large, indicating that NiO can be used to prepare a sensor for detecting cable faults, which provides a direction for the fault detection of cross-linked polyethylene power cables in the future. © 2020 COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Our combined method has been evaluated through software simulation, in which we have injected 1200 fault attacks into a running AES code. The simulation results show that the run-time monitoring and post-execution verification methods can, together, detect up to 98% of conducted fault attacks. The biggest advantage of this method is its applicability to any hardware platform without the need for additional hardware support. © 2024 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85206127269
"Characterization of incremental encoders by accelerometers mounted on the rotor Among the bearing and/or gear fault detection methods used, the measurement of instantaneous angular speed has proven to be a reliable tool, the potential of which have not yet been fully investigated. The sensor used to obtain this signal is most often an incremental encoder which, due to its design, is subjected to a geometric error that can more or less mask the useful content of the signal. The purpose of this paper is to present a method for qualifying the geometric error of incremental encoders by means of accelerometers positioned in the tangential direction. The accelerometers are free of geometric errors and therefore constitute a reference for the evaluation of the geometric error of other sensors, allowing to compare different types of sensors. Moreover, the separation of the torsional and transverse components of the accelerometer signal leads to the evaluation of the impact of transverse vibrations on the signal delivered by the encoder, and therefore on the instantaneous measured speed of rotation. Finally, the paper suggest that tangential accelerometers may be used rather than incremental encoders in the context of fault detection. © 2020 Proceedings of ISMA 2020 - International Conference on Noise and Vibration Engineering and USD 2020 - International Conference on Uncertainty in Structural Dynamics.

"Data-driven strain prediction models and fatigue damage accumulation The ability to accurately predict current condition and remaining life of our high-value assets is crucial to guarantee safety, maximise use and minimise maintenance costs. Where structures operate in complex dynamic environments (e.g. offshore), this task is clearly a significant challenge, particularly as the loading is often unknown and difficult to characterise. As the number of measurement campaigns of high-value structures has increased, loads monitoring has become an area of interest within the SHM community. Where strain or acceleration measurements are available over a period of time, these may be used to build an understanding of the loads a structure has undergone. Unfortunately, the coverage of most sensing systems employed on operating structures is restricted by budget, accessibility and, in some cases, a hostile operating environment (i.e. subsea). In this work we employ a Gaussian process regression model to act as a virtual sensor, predicting strain at a given location on a structure. A probabilistic methodology for assessing fatigue damage accumulation is developed, where the uncertainty of the strain prediction from the Gaussian process is incorporated. The method is demonstrated with data from a monitoring campaign of small aircraft. © 2020 Proceedings of ISMA 2020 - International Conference on Noise and Vibration Engineering and USD 2020 - International Conference on Uncertainty in Structural Dynamics.

"Wind turbine pitch misalignment detection through tower vibration signal processing The demand for highly efficient wind energy conversion systems has led to the development of new approaches for fault diagnosis and operational issues detection. However, systematic errors, such as yaw offset, pitch unbalance or other sensor errors, can be challenging to identify. Although these errors generally have little impact on day-to-day operation, they can have a detrimental effect on machine efficiency and affect the remaining useful life of key components. In the present work, a multi time-scale approach to pitch error detection on a multi-MW horizontal axis wind turbine has been developed and applied to the case of a machine affected by a small pitch error. The method is designed to operate using data from industrial SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) and CM (Condition Monitoring) systems.

"Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Drones in the Industrial Internet of Things Using Federated Learning and Explainable AI Predictive maintenance is crucial for optimizing industrial operations by reducing downtime and maintenance costs. We propose a novel approach integrating Federated Learning (FL) and Explainable AI (XAI) to enhance predictive maintenance in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments. Our methodology leverages decentralized sensor data from various IoT devices, including drones, across industrial plants to enable collaborative model training while ensuring data privacy.

"Multi-Parametric Gas Sensing for Transformer Monitoring Using an Optical Fiber Sensor Array The maintenance and inspection of power transformers can be a time-consuming task for electric utilities, but it is a necessity for maintaining electrical grid reliability. A standard strategy for diagnosis of fault conditions in an oil-filled transformer is to periodically acquire oil samples and perform dissolved gas analysis (DGA). Aging and temperature variation can induce varying concentrations of hydrogen, methane, and other hydrocarbons, which all form as the oil degrades. Acetylene (C2H2) is generated only during localized, high-temperature events such as partial discharge, and its presence is a key marker for identifying these conditions.. The development of optical fiber-based sensors to fill the role of DGA offers several advantages, including the option to implement real-time, in-situ, or even spatially resolved (distributed or quasi-distributed) sensing schemes. The evanescent field approach, in conjunction with tailored sensing materials, provides a cheap and scalable solution to this problem. However, this solution is oftentimes hampered by long-term stability and cross-sensitivity issues. One solution is to gather data from multiple optical fiber sensors designed to eliminate cross-sensitivity and calibrate drift. In this work, a multi-sensor array is developed to target multiple gas species relevant to transformer monitoring (C2H2, CH4, H2). This approach, combined with machine learning models such as support vector machines (SVM), can be used to identify the gas species present at concentrations relevant to DGA (ppm levels) with dramatically increased accuracy. © 2023 SPIE.

"PROGNOS: An Automatic Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Prediction Model for Military Systems Using Machine Learning In modern industrial settings, the quality of maintenance efforts directly influence equipment’s operational uptime and efficiency. Condition monitoring is a common process employed for predicting the health of a technical asset, whereby a predictive maintenance strategy can be adopted to minimize machine downtime and potential losses. Throughout the field, machine learning (ML) methods have become noteworthy for predicting failures before they occur, thereby preventing significant financial costs and providing a safer workplace environment.

"Automatic boiler tube leak detection with deep bidirectional LSTM neural networks of acoustic emission signals Boiler tubes in power plants develop defects including creep and thermal fatigue damage that can lead to fluid leakage over the operation period. Such leakage is the main cause of outages and power generation losses in thermal power plants. Therefore, early detection of leaks in boiler tubes is necessary to avoid more than 60% of boiler outages. To monitor and detect tube leaks in real-time, Acoustic Emission (AE) technique is widely used in power plants. A boiler tube leak could be detected using Average Signal Level (ASL) of the acquired AE signal using a network of sensors attached to the body of the boiler. Changes in ASL are proportional to the tube leakage; however, background signals generated by operating soot blowers bury the features which represent the tube leaks in the boiler and makes it nearly impossible to detect them automatically with established threshold methods. Soot blowers are used to remove the soot that is deposited on the tubes to maintain the efficacy and continuous operation of boilers. In this study, a bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) is developed to automatically detect tube leaks in power plant boilers. This detection method aims at identifying abnormal acoustic signals which differ from the reference/normal data that the system was trained with. The neural networks are trained on a sample boiler and the evaluation was done on the same boiler on the intervals with leak presence. Once the developed machine learning algorithm was tested with AE signals acquired from boiler tubes, the results show that this novel approach can detect anomalies in the signal levels as an indication of tube defects with an acceptable accuracy. © 2020 SPIE.",2-s2.0-85085701547
"Monitoring internal power transformer temperature using distributed optical fiber sensors Condition monitoring of power transformers is of great importance for the timely detection of incipient faults to avoid potential malfunctioning. Transformer insulating oil contains about 70% of diagnostic information, and a dramatic rise in oil temperature may drastically reduce the lifetime of power transformers, and thus the temperature of the oil is considered the most crucial parameter that has to be monitored continuously in real-time. Compared to traditional temperature measurement methods used in transformer condition monitoring, distributed optical fiber sensors have inherent advantages of immunity to electromagnetic interference and insulation at high-voltage levels, and they offer spatially resolved temperature monitoring with high accuracy and sensitivity. In this study, optical fiber-based distributed temperature measurement of a fully energized 100 kVA distribution transformer is demonstrated by using two different techniques: Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometry (OFDR) and Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensor array. The fiber sensors are robust for a safe long-term installation into oil-filled distribution transformers during manufacturing, and they can withstand heat runs, long-term hot oil immersion, and transformer vibration.

"Powerline Fault Detection and Location Tracking with GSM Electricity is critical for the progress of livelihood in many Indian cities. However, there are numerous issues with power loss, often caused by obstacles falling on transmission lines or faults in the lines. Additionally, under voltage and over voltage pose significant concerns as they can lead to equipment damage. Unfortunately, these voltage issues often go unreported to the centralized body, such as KSEB in Kerala, as people have to manually call the authorities. This method is not only inconvenient but also ineffective, especially during nighttime power outages when reporting becomes challenging. Moreover, connecting with KSEB can be problematic due to the high volume of calls, leading to server connection issues. When line breakages occur, KSEB workers must manually locate the fault, a cumbersome process. To address these challenges, we need a method to swiftly identify faults in the power lines.

But there is a note – a size of wear debris ranges in different work conditionals and depends on type of machine. For example, the size of wear debris during normal operation of a new engine ought to be at the range between 1 µm to 10 µm and at the constant correlation. If the conditions are abnormal the debris size will be between 20 µm and 100 µm. The size of wear debris parts and concentration of them will increase in time during the machine until it fails. The critical size is more than 100 µm the engine is in critical conditions and need to immediate stop and maintenance to avoid machine failure.

One great example of mostly unused energy is the vibration of industrial machines. Along with the rise of predictive maintenance, more wireless sensors have been used to monitor those machines. Where the vibration energy present in those machines can be used to extend the sensor’s life constrained by the battery. This work presents two fabrication approaches to design these devices using the piezoelectric principle: MEMS fabrication and micro-machined devices. MEMS are widely investigated for harvesting purposes for their capability of building complex micro-scale structures (< 0.1 cm3). However, it can be difficult to designing MEMS energy harvesting systems for the low frequency range (40 Hz to 200 Hz), which is the operating range for standard industrial machines. The adapted micro-machined harvesters from off-the-shelf piezoelectric components mostly used in macro-scale applications (> 10 cm3), can be an alternative in this situation. Numerical models were developed to simulate the dynamic behavior of the piezoelectric device and used as input for design optimization. The models were improved using a differential evolution algorithm optimizing in terms of the Normalized Power Density (NPD) and Mechanical stress. In order to validate these models, prototypes were built ns tested, with the results compared considering the NPD and frequency bandwidth.

"An adaptive SIF and KF estimation strategy for fault detection based on the NIS metric State estimation strategies play an essential role in the effective operation of dynamic systems by extracting relevant information about the system's state when faced with limited measurement capability, sensor noise, or uncertain dynamics. The Kalman filter (KF) is one of the most commonly used filters and provides an optimal estimate for linear state estimation problems. However, the KF lacks robustness as it does not perform well in the face of modelling uncertainties and disturbances. The sliding innovation filter (SIF) is a newly proposed filter that uses a switching gain and innovation term, and unlike the KF, it only results in a sub-optimal estimate. However, the SIF has been proven to be robust to modelling uncertainties, disturbances, and ill-conditioned problems.

The input random noise of generator in GAN is replaced by the synthetic sample of SMOTE, which makes the samples more consistent with the real distribution, to solve the imbalanced class problem, thus improve the fault diagnosis ability of the classification model. This method is applied to experimental gearbox fault datasets. The classification ability and robustness of the detection model in different imbalance rates are analysed, and the results show that SMOTIFIED-GAN improved the detection rate. Compared with the traditional methods, the F1 score of fault detection results is improved, and the feasibility of the proposed method. © 2023 SPIE.",2-s2.0-85170828620
"A DEEP GENERATIVE MODEL FOR REMAINING USEFUL LIFE PREDICTION OF AERO-ENGINES Predictive maintenance is helpful for building smart, sustainable, and resilient mechanical systems. Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is the core procedure for estimating the operation time of systems before repair or replacement. Recent, deep learning-based RUL prediction methods have achieved good performance in some cases. However, the assets with same type have different RUL which results in the sample imbalance problem. In real operating condition, samples with healthy status are the majority of training samples. Few researches discussed the problem decreasing accuracy of prediction models. In this work, a deep generative model based on bidirectional long short-term memory network (Bi-LSTM) and graph neural network is proposed for RUL prediction of aero-engines considering the sample imbalance problem. The Bi-LSTM is firstly used to generate samples with minority labels by regression and the exponential weighted moving average technique (EWMA) was used to smooth the synthetic samples. Next, the graph convolution layers are used to fusing multi-sensor signals and a deep encoder-decoder structure is proposed to adaptively extract latent features. Finally, the latent features are input the predictor for RUL prediction. C-MAPSS aircraft engine simulator data is used to test the deep generative model in this work.

"Hybrid Technique for Sensor Fault Diagnosis in Natural-Gas Pipelines Sensor fault diagnosis is crucial for the safe and reliable monitoring of natural gas pipelines. Even though model-based techniques have remarkable performance, they still face significant challenges such as non-linearity and external dis-turbances.

"Optimal application of permanent magnet synchronous motor in new energy vehicle Promoting new energy vehicles (NEVs) is considered to be one of the most effective ways to solve the increasingly serious problems of energy security and environmental pollution. With the growing energy shortage and the worsening of environmental pollution, electric vehicle (EV), as a new energy vehicle driven by electric energy, has attracted more and more attention. Because of its small size, high efficiency, large overload capacity and fast response, the brushless electric motor has occupied an important position in the servo field and is an ideal choice for electric drive systems of electric vehicles. The control precision of PMSM depends on the precision of rotor position detection to a great extent. The traditional method of obtaining rotor position is realized by high resolution position sensors, such as resolver, photoelectric encoder. It can obtain the rotor flux position with high resolution accurately and in real time, but this method has high cost. In order to reduce the cost of rotor position detection, the sensorless control technology has been developed. The rotor position is estimated by detecting the variables such as current, voltage and motor parameters. However, the Control Algorithm is complex and requires high parameters, and it doesn't work at full speed. Computationally efficient design of interior permanent magnet (IPM) motor rotor features is investigated utilizing analytical methods. The rotating transformer and the high-frequency signal method independently detect the rotor position, the high-frequency signal method verifies the detection precision of the rotating transformer at low speed, and the high-frequency signal method rotor position detection system at high speed stops working, in the case of a rotating transformer fault, the high frequency signal method system supports the motor to drive at low speed in fault mode.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

"Fault detection and diagnosis for PZT sensors with electro-mechanical impedance technique by using one-dimensional convolutional autoencoder Piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate (PZT) sensors are widely used in various structural health monitoring (SHM) applications, where data acquired by the PZT sensors are used for damage detection. Any failure of the PZT sensors will have a detrimental effect in the ability of SHM systems to detect damage. Therefore, detecting faulty PZT sensor is critical to reduce any false-calls associated with malfunctioning sensor to ensure proper functionality of SHM systems. This paper proposes a self-diagnostic method to monitoring the health of PZT sensors using the electro-mechanical impedance (EMI) data in two steps. In the first detection step, the one-dimensional convolutional autoencoder (1D-CAE) is employed to obtain the reconstruction error as anomaly scores from the raw EMI data. Hence, the faulty PZT sensors can be detected by comparing the anomaly score with a pre-defined threshold. In the second diagnostic step, the data feature is first extracted with the 1D-CAE. The extracted feature is then fed into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier to classify the fault type of the PZT sensor. The proposed method was validated through experiments, where typical in-service induced damages such as impact, environmental effect, sensor breakage localized high temperature heating, etc. were introduced. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for both detection and diagnosis of various types of PZT sensor damage. © 2021 SPIE",2-s2.0-85107518829

"Sensing materials for optical fiber-based selective detection of acetylene Early fault detection in oil-filled power transformers is an important factor in improving the stability and reliability of the electrical grid. Faults typically result from high-temperature degradation of the mineral oil, either by operation above temperature specification or through localized heating due to electrical discharge and arcing. The standard strategy for diagnosis of fault conditions is to periodically sample the mineral oil and perform dissolved gas analysis (DGA). Varying concentrations of hydrogen (H2), methane (CH4), acetylene (C2H2), and other hydrocarbons are generated as the oil degrades and can be indicative of fault type. The development of optical fiber-based sensors for dissolved gas detection within transformer oil may provide important new advantages above ex-situ DGA, such as real-time monitoring and spatially resolved (distributed) sensing within the transformer oil. Several different material systems are investigated for detection of acetylene, as well as other hydrocarbons relevant to mineral oil degradation within transformers. Inspired by materials highlighted in the literature for selective acetylene catalysis, several nanostructured nickel / silica oxide-based films are investigated for evanescent field-based sensor materials.

"IoT Based Health Monitoring and Load Sharing of a Transformer The transformer serves as a stationary apparatus, it transfers the electrical power between circuits, adjusting voltage and current to desired levels while maintaining a consistent frequency. A transformer can operate most efficiently from no load condition to full load capacity, but it will face issues when it is overloaded, which will lead to a serious problem for the health of the transformer. Therefore, it is essential to monitor their health and efficiently distribute the load among multiple transformers. To prevent a transformer from overloading, a backup transformer is employed to power the load when the main transformer is overloaded. The backup transformer is activated automatically by a microcontroller. This setup ensures optimal loading for both transformers. Additionally, both transformers can be turned on to provide the load alternately when the load is normal. Health monitoring involves real-time data acquisition from sensors placed on the transformer, capturing parameters such as temperature, humidity, and load levels. The data from these sensors can be accessed remotely through the Thing Speak platform, providing users with a convenient way to monitor the health and status of the transformers. Predictive maintenance strategies are therefore implemented to address issues before they lead to costly downtime and repairs. This approach replaces manual monitoring and testing, reducing the chances of errors and saving time and effort in maintaining transformer health and load sharing.  © 2024 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85192530833

"BRIEF PAPER: PROCESS MONITORING AND FAULT DETECTION IN LASER POWDER BED FUSION USING IN-SITU ACOUSTIC EMISSIONS This work concerns process monitoring in the laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing process. In this work, we developed and applied a novel in-situ solution for process stability monitoring and flaw detection using acoustic emission sensing. Current process monitoring methods in laser powder bed fusion only focus on the top surface of the deposition process, using an array of sensors to capture data on a layer-by-layer basis. Common sensors used for in-situ monitoring of the laser powder bed fusion process are optical, infrared, and high-speed imaging cameras along with pyrometers and photodiodes. A critical flaw with traditional top surface monitoring methodologies is that they are unable to reliably monitor the subsurface phenomena that occur in the laser powder bed fusion process. These subsurface effects are caused by the meltpool penetrating multiple layers below thetop surface, leadingto the re-solidification of the microstructure and potentially generating keyhole porosity. By only monitoring the top surface of the laser powder bed fusion process, the meltpool depth aspects and effects are ignored. To overcome the limitations of current in-situ monitoring of subsurface effects, this work utilizes four passive acoustic emission sensors attached to the build plate. These acoustic emission sensors monitor the energy emissions generated from the surface-level laser material interactions. Moreover, the acoustic emission signals are capable of traveling through the previously deposited layers, through the build plate, and to the sensors. Therefore, the acoustic waveform generated by the laser can capture process phenomena ranging from the crystallographic level to the macro-scale layer level which are at the root of flaw formation inside the deposited part. Hence, acoustic emission monitoring has the ability to monitor the subsurface effects in the laser powder bed fusion process. To monitor and analyze this acoustic waveform, novel wavelet-based decomposition is combined with heterogeneous sensor fusion to not only capture the acoustic waveform in time, but also in locational space on the build plate. Locational acoustic emission data enables the ability to determine the source of the generated acoustic waveform which is advantageous when the location of flaws is desired. This extracted spatially placed acoustic waveform data is able to detect the effect of processing parameters with a statistical fidelity of 99%. The proposed locational acoustic waveform monitoring method correlates to the resulting surface roughness of manufactured samples with a fidelity of 86%. Additionally, we show that acoustic waveform monitoring detects the onset of part failure, recoater crashes, and warpage prior a priori to the actual failure point. © 2024 by ASME.",2-s2.0-85203686089
"EFFICIENT FAULT DETECTION IN BEARINGS: SYNERGIZING TRANSFORMER ADAPTATIONS WITH CONVOLUTIONAL KERNEL Efficient and accurate bearing fault diagnosis and prognostics are crucial for predictive maintenance in industrial settings.

"MSCAN: AN AUTOMATED IN-SITU FAULT DETECTION SYSTEM FOR DESKTOP FUSED FILAMENT FABRICATION 3D PRINTERS UTILIZING A NON-CONTACT SENSOR Fused filament fabrication (FFF) has gained widespread recognition across diverse industries owing to its rapid prototyping and cost-effectiveness advantages. As a result, it is the most prevalent modality for desktop 3D printing. However, FFF can be susceptible to a variety of printing defects and jeopardize the printing quality. Monitoring when defects occur during 3D printing and promptly stopping faulty printing remains a significant challenge. To address this challenge, engineers have developed techniques for detecting and characterizing defects during the FFF printing process. They can be categorized into contact and non-contact detection methodologies. Non-contact methods usually rely on computer vision or laser scanning. However, computer vision needs the assistance of machine learning and demands a substantial amount of training data for accurate detection. Moreover, computer vision is susceptible to ambient light conditions. The laser scanning method detects the printing defects by comparing the point cloud obtained from scanning the printed object with the CAD model. However, this approach heavily depends on the precision of the laser scanner, and achieving high accuracy often entails a significant financial investment for a good laser scanner. To improve accuracy and cost-effectiveness, a low-cost contact-based detection system called MTouch was developed in prior work. However, using contact sensors carries a risk of damaging fragile prints and leading to printing failures. In response, this paper introduces a non-contact, cost-effective, and robust detection method, MScan, to detect defects during the printing process. In the MScan setup, a laser-camera sensor is designed with a laser stripe emitter and a camera module based on laser triangulation to assess the absence of the printed object during the printing process. Additionally, MScan employs an effective and straightforward image processing and data acquisition algorithm to ensure its robustness and computational efficiency. The effectiveness of MScan is demonstrated experimentally by deploying it on an Ender 3 desktop FFF 3D printer. A fault detection accuracy of over 95% is achieved. Furthermore, MScan's robustness to lighting variations is experimentally demonstrated. © 2024 by ASME.",2-s2.0-85203686123
"Multi-Sensor Interactive Perception Graph Attention Networks for Remaining Useful Life Estimation With the increasing intelligence of equipment, prognostics and health management (PHM) has been rapidly developed and highly valued. As more sensors are employed to track the full life of complicated equipment, sensor redundancy becomes a concern. However, most current deep learning-based prediction models cannot effectively perform sensor selection, and do not fully take advantage of the spatiotemporal interaction relationships among the sensors. To address these issues, a Remaining useful life (RUL) estimation method based on multi-sensor and interaction perception, named MultiSensor interaction perception graph attention networks (MIPGATs), is proposed. To achieve effective sensor selection and mining of spatial interaction relationships among sensors, a heterogeneous graph with sensors as nodes is constructed. Based on the graph, the weights of edges and degree centrality of nodes are learned adaptively by attention mechanisms in order to construct interactions between sensors and achieve sensor screening. The remaining edges are then normalized to create the final graph embedding. Finally, graph attention networks (GATs) are employed to implement dynamic learning of the graph embedding over the course of the device's lifespan. The experiments results on the turbofan engine shows that our model achieved effective sensor selection and mining of spatial interaction relationships among them without sacrificing accuracy.  © 2023 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85178016139

"Comparison of Light Sensors for Arc Detection inside Power Transformer Tanks: Basic Investigations Transformer explosions and fires are the most dangerous consequences of transformer faults. Besides the financial loss, consequences are often environmental pollution, fires and personal injury or even death. Especially for substations in densely populated areas, this is a very high risk. As protection each transformer is equipped with a Buchholzrelay (BHR), which identifies such failures, thus a circuit breaker (CB) can trip the transformer. The time between the internal breakdown and the disconnection of the transformer is approximately 4-5 cycles, which are almost equally split between the response times of the BHR and the CB. However, in some cases the tripping of the transformer is not fast enough in order to prevent a tank rupture and the catastrophic collateral damages described above. Therefore faster arc detection systems are under investigation like the use of photo sensitive semiconductors inside the transformer tank to detect the light emission from an arc and to trigger the circuit breaker.

"Learnable Topology Enhanced Heterogeneous Network for Unbalanced Cross-Domain Fault Diagnosis The emerging graph convolutional networks (GCN) have led to their widespread application in fault diagnosis due to their advantages in feature extraction. However, there are still some limitations of the GCN-based methods in the face of cross-domain diagnostic tasks. First, in most of the existing studies, the graph topology is constructed according to certain criteria. However, the fixed topology may contain domain-specific information, which could hinder the extraction of domain-invariant features. Second, the class unbalanced data would lead to training bias, degrading the diagnostic performance for the minority classes of data.

"Resilient Collaborative All-source Navigation The Autonomous and Resilient Management of All-source Sensors with Stable Observability Monitoring (ARMAS-SOM) framework fuses collaborative all-source sensor information in a resilient manner with fault detection, exclusion, and integrity solutions recognizable to a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) user. This framework uses a multi-filter residual monitoring approach for fault detection and exclusion which is augmented with an additional ""observability""Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) sub-layer for resilience. We monitor the a posteriori state covariances in this sub-layer to provide intrinsic awareness when navigation state observability assumptions required for integrity are in danger. The framework leverages this to selectively augment with offboard information and preserve resilience. By maintaining split parallel collaborative and proprioceptive frameworks and employing a novel ""stingy collaboration""technique, we are able maximize efficient use of network resources, limit the propagation of unknown corruption to a single donor, prioritize high fidelity donors, and maintain consistent collaborative navigation without fear of double-counting in a scalable processing footprint.

"A New Compound Fault Diagnosis Method for Gearbox Based on Convolutional Neural Network This paper focus on the fault diagnosis problem for the compound faults of rotating machine, in which the rolling bearing and the sun gear faults simultaneously occurred are considered as the compound fault. Considering the traditional compound fault diagnosis methods usually utilize the manual fault features extraction, which are mainly dependent on engineering experience, we propose a compound fault diagnosis method named multi-sensor based convolutional neural network (MCNN). For vibration signals of compound faults, the different transmission paths and the positions of the sensors means one part of the embedded single faults may have higher energy. The vibration signals collected from three sensors at different positions can help guarantee the completeness of the characteristics of the compound fault. Then, the multi-sensor signals are combined together and fused by the convolutional operation of the convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The CNN model, which can automatically extract features from the vibration signals and achieve classification, is used for fault extraction and fault recognition.

"Raw Mill Engine Failure Detection from Transformer Gated Convolutional Unit Networks From the era of Industry 4.0, Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology has developed an industrial maintenance strategy, namely Predictive Maintenance (PdM), to boost massive production processes. One task in PdM is to estimate the engine failure time to help the decision-making on maintenance strategies, called diagnostic task. Besides that, diagnostic tasks play a dominant role as they can ensure uninterrupted production steps in almost all industry fields, including a sand-cement factory. In this work, we focus on raw mill as the first major engine in sand-cement production. Further, we attempt to estimate the failure time of the raw mill engine as early as possible by applying Transformer-Gated Convolutional Unit Networks (T-GCUN). In brief, the Gated Convolutional Unit (GCU) captures the local features of the multi-sensor data. The transformer estimates the failure time of raw mill engine by learning the short and long-term dependencies and local features from GCU. In the experiments, we studied multi-sensor data from the raw mill engine in one of the sand-cement factories in Indonesia around 2015, as most failures occurred.

"An α-Rényi Divergence Sigmoïd Parametrization for a Multi-Objectives and Context-Adaptive Fault Tolerant Localization For a localization function, meeting together safety, accuracy and availability is a challenging task. Targeting one of these Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) remains feasible but when one or more other requirements are expected at the same time, the objectives become antagonistic. To achieve accuracy, a multi-sensor data fusion is recommended. However, it remains insufficient when it comes to safety critical applications as autonomous vehicle. Indeed, a diagnostic layer has to be considered to treat the presence of faults in dynamic environment, which can affect the sensors measurements. The detection algorithm must ensure high fault sensitivity while keeping false alarm rate as low as possible and taking into account both the change of navigation context and the change of targeted KPIs. This paper proposes a GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) and INS (Inertial Navigation system) data fusion approach based on an unscented information filter for state estimation boosted by an adaptive diagnostic layer consisting of a Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) method based on a powerful parametric information divergence: the α-Rényi divergence. The concept of diagnosis adaptability is developed by applying a sigmoïd strategy in order to increase the sensitivity of the selected residual to detect maximum of faults according to the crossed environment. The suitable selection, at each instant, of α, is ensured through the implementation of a generalized logistic function according to the current constraint of the navigation context. Following the detection step, a decision-cost optimized threshold is reevaluated at each instant. Applied to field data, the first experiments show promising results of the developed framework compared to a diagnostic layer based on the well-known Kullback-Leibler divergence.  © 2021 International Society of Information Fusion (ISIF).",2-s2.0-85123444310

"Non-Intrusive Cooling System Fault Detection and Diagnostics Using Acoustic Emission Power intensification and miniaturization of electronics and energy systems are causing a critical challenge for thermal management. Single-phase heat transfer mechanisms including natural and forced convection of air and liquids cannot meet the ever-increasing demands. Two-phase heat transfer modes, such as evaporation, pool boiling, flow boiling, have much higher cooling capacities but are limited by a variety of practical instabilities, e.g., the critical heat flux (CHF), aka departure from nucleate boiling (DNB) in the nuclear industry, flow maldistribution, flow reversal, among others. These instabilities are often triggered suddenly during normal operation, and if not identified and mitigated in time, will lead to overheating issues and detrimental device failures. For example, when CHF is triggered during pool boiling, the device temperature can ramp up in the order of 150 ?C/min. It is thus critical to implement real-time detection and mitigation algorithms for two-phase cooling.

"Preventing Transformer Explosions with Fast Arc Detection by Fiber Optic Sensors The adverse effects of transformer faults are manifold, including transformer explosions and fires that can result in significant financial losses, environmental damages, and physical harm or even fatalities. Therefore, Buchholz relays (BHR) are widely employed in power transformers to detect main faults in order to prevent tank ruptures. However, in some circumstances, BHRs may not trip quickly enough to prevent the aforementioned damages once an arc occurs in the transformer tank. In this regard, this investigation aims to develop a new system for fast arc detection, before increasing the internal pressure inside the tank. Fiber optic cables are used to design a novel sensor capable of detecting visible light emitted by an arc. In this paper, initially, the sensor is introduced and its performance is explained in detail using simulation, and then it is experimentally tested in different circumstances, including mineral oils, temperature variations, reflecting housing, and arc energy. Based on the results, the sensor recognized the fault at different temperatures as well as in mineral oil, and also reflections inside the transformer improve considerably the signal received by the sensor. A quick detection of arcs can be achieved with this method and this sensor is well compatible for use inside transformers. ©2024 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85217386195

"Syndrome Diagnostics - Fault Detection and Isolation for Complex Systems using Causation-based AI Syndrome Diagnostics (SD) is a real-time Failure Detection and Isolation software tool for complex, safety & mission-critical engineering systems. Utilizing causal-based AI, SD identifies patterns (syndromes) of failures and autonomously associates them with the root cause based on diagnostics (sensor data) and analytics (metadata from external sources).Downtime for complex and capital-intensive equipment from unexpected failures has significant cost safety, and market risks; even more so for design, who must meet stringent safety & certification requirements. In the post COVID world, organizations must also transition to technology that supports distributed operations - increased demand for remote monitoring is an economically-constrained environment.To compensate these impacts, organizations are looking to implement Predictive Maintenance (PdM) to achieve optimal timing of maintenance maximizing availability and components' useful life, with the least chance of downtime. This requires that monitoring happens in real time to 'catch failures before they happen'.PdM nowadays rely heavily on observed physical symptoms using pure data-driven solutions, however this leads to issues such as spurious correlation which presumes incorrect relationships. These errors in a safety critical system are unacceptable and may result in loss of life in addition to those mentioned previously. We present in this paper, Syndrome Diagnostics, which is a fundamentally different approach to FDI - rather than establishing patterns of systems responses based on correlation that is then manually confirmed by a human specialists, a causation-based strategy is used.Causation is derived from a risk model that builds a qualitative representation of the system, trading parametric simulations with straightforward failure associations. The AI aspect uses machine learning methods to detect failures. Unsupervised algorithms trigger more precise supervised techniques to label (state relative to threshold) each sensor reading within a snapshot. The risk model is then leveraged to relate each sensor label to the failure mode that led to those patterns. © 2021 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85123049768
"Predictive Resource Management in Energy-constrained Embedded Systems The current trends in Internet of Things (IoT) lead to the deployment of low-power devices covering a wide range of application scenarios. These devices have the goal of executing simple tasks, automatically, usually with strict requirements in terms of space and cost. Typically, these devices have to rely on batteries or by harvesting energy devices (e.g., solar panels), in order to operate. On the other hand, IoT devices may be equipped with powerful multi-core CPUs to achieve performance goals, making the management of the energy budget a challenging task. This requires the development of an effective management system, that takes into account current and future energy budget availability, to dynamically bound the actual allocation of processing resources. Specifically, when exploiting solar panels for power supply, we can leverage on the weather forecast, to estimate the availability of energy in the near future. This paper introduces a predictive energy budget management system, targeting multi-core based embedded platforms. Thanks to both local and large-scale weather information, our solution aims at predicting the future incoming power and, accordingly, tuning the exploitable performance level to keep the system running under any environmental condition. © 2020 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85096365690
"Dynamic encoding, a lightweight combined countermeasure against hardware attacks With the Internet of Things (IoT) an increasing amount of sensitive data have to be communicated and hence encrypted. Low-cost hardware attacks such as fault analysis (FA) or side-channel analysis (SCA) threaten the implementation of cryptographic algorithms. Many countermeasures have been proposed against either of these attacks, however, only a few countermeasures protect efficiently an implementation against both attacks. These combined countermeasures usually have a prohibitive area and power overhead, and require up to thousands of bits of fresh randomness at each encryption. Therefore, they may not be suited to protect lightweight algorithms in resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we propose a new combined countermeasure, which is particularly adapted to protect lightweight algorithms based on shift registers. It achieves an efficient power balancing at algorithmic level, and provides an inherent fault detection with a better coverage than most existing combined countermeasures. Furthermore, it has a smaller power and area overhead than existing combined countermeasures, and requires at most 8 random bits at each encryption. © 2020 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85096353107
"Data-Driven Prognostics Incorporating Environmental Factors for Aircraft Maintenance During flights aircraft continuously collect data regarding operations, health status and system condition. Data-driven approaches typically applied to system specific sensor data provide a way to predict failures of aircraft systems. However, it is believed that some systems deteriorate faster when subjected to particular environmental conditions, such as humidity or dust. In this study, we consider an aircraft system which is suspected to experience degradation due to humidity during ground operations. We apply a Random Forest approach to sensor data only and a combination of sensor data and environmental data from airports to estimate the system's remaining useful life. To our knowledge this is the first paper addressing the problem of integrating environmental data in prognostics for aircraft systems using raw sensor data. The method is validated on a data set provided by an airline that includes the per-second sensor data of 11 different sensors for roughly 12,300 flights, as well as 15 removals. Meteorological data for airports worldwide is obtained from the Meteorological Aerodrome Reports database. The results show that incorporating environmental data in prognostics has a potential towards more accurate prediction models. © 2021 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85123046258
"Effectiveness of time-based methods for the early detection of bearing faults Conditional maintenance, grounded on industrial monitoring and diagnostic methodologies, has become critical. In this context, the predominant technique is vibration analysis, wherein the data analysis phase holds utmost significance. This crucial stage is conducted through temporal, frequency, and time-frequency methods. The objectives of this study are to examine the efficacy of temporal methods (RMS and Kurtosis) in early-stage detection of bearing faults, along with exploring influential factors such as rotation speed, sensor positions, load, and the types and dimensions of faults. To achieve this, various combinations of these factors have been explored to assess the effectiveness of these scalar parameters under diverse conditions. The case study demonstrates that kurtosis emerges as the most effective scalar in early-stage identification of faults, in contrast to RMS, which proves more effective for high-speed scenarios but serves as a late indicator. Moreover, the complementary of these methods is crucial for fault identification and facilitates informed decisions within the context of condition-based maintenance policies.  © 2024 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85195409685
"Querying Distributed Sensor Streams in the Edge-To-Cloud Continuum Sensor data is of crucial importance in many IoT scenarios. It is used for online monitoring as well as long term data analytics, enabling countless use cases from damage prevention to predictive maintenance. Multivariate sensor time series data is acquired and initially stored close to the sensor, at the edge. It is also beneficial to summarize this data in windowed aggregations at different resolutions. A subset of the resulting aggregation hierarchy is typically sent to a cloud infrastructure, often via intermittent or low bandwidth connections. Consequently, different views on the data exist on different nodes in the edge-To-cloud continuum. However, when querying this data, users are interested in a fast response and a complete, unified view on the data, regardless of which part in the infrastructure continuum they send the query to and where the data is physically stored. In this paper, we present a loosely coupled approach that enables fast range queries on a distributed and hierarchical sensor database. Our system only assumes the possibility of fast local range queries on a hierarchical sensor database. It does not require any shared state between nodes and thus degrades gracefully in case certain parts of the hierarchy are unreachable. We show that our system is suitable for driving interactive data exploration sessions on terabytes of data while unifying the different views on the data. Thus, our system can improve the data analysis experience in many geo-distributed scenarios.  © 2022 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85140597667
"Computational enhancements to the mahalanobis-Taguchi system to improve fault detection and diagnostics Fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) refers to identifying the abnormal operations of a machine and then determining the cause or causes of the fault. FDD is an important use case of Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT) technology. This paper introduces the Mahalanobis-Taguchi system (MTS) method and additional enhancements that apply to common data scenarios. Genichi Taguchi proposed the MTS method of diagnosing multivariate data. It has been successfully used for FDD and quality control in various industries, including electrical power, chemicals, and aerospace. The MTS method involves the following three steps.Step 1: The multivariate sensor data from a machine's normal (or fault-free) operations are collected. The sensor variables are standardized, and the Mahalanobis distance (MD) of the observations from the center is calculated. These MD values define what is referred to as the Mahalanobis space of normal observations. The MTS method uses the Mahalanobis space as a reference scale for identifying outliers. This step can be considered the model training step.Step 2: New observations are scored by calculating their MD values. During scoring, the observations are first scaled using the mean and standard deviation of sensor variables by employing the machine's normal operations data, which were collected in step 1. The MD computation in step 2 uses the correlation matrix of the normal operations data. An observation is an outlier, or the presence of a fault is indicated if that observation's MD value is higher than the typical MD value of observations in normal or fault-free operations.Step 3: Fault diagnosis is performed by identifying important variables to improve model interpretability. A design-of-experiments approach is adopted for such identification by using orthogonal arrays and the signal-To-noise (S/N) ratio.In addition to these three steps, a data preprocessing step is added before training to enhance MTS capability in handling certain common data scenarios:Step 0: Three common data scenarios are addressed:•data that contain observations from both normal operations and faults•data that are multimodal or clustered•data with many correlated factors or data that have a singular covariance matrixIn this preprocessing step, we propose a robust outlier detection technique to handle data that contain observations from normal operations and faults. In the case of multimodal or clustered data, we apply a clustering method to address separate and distinct data distributions. We use a generalized inverse of the correlation matrix and implement a dimension reduction method for data with a high factor dimension, containing highly correlated factors or factors with a singular correlation matrix.Because the MTS method is an interpretable outlier detection technique, it is very attractive for FDD. This paper introduces the MTS method for FDD, discusses certain limitations of MTS, and offers enhancements to address those limitations. © 2023 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85153181422
"A Hierarchical Automata Based Approach for Anomaly Detection in Smart Home Devices Smart home is an important application scenario of the Internet of Things. However, smart home tends to suffer from runtime failures due to its complex software/hardware, unexpected/wrong human operations, environmental changes, etc. It is hard to detect the device anomalies, since smart devices have various types, various failure types, and they also generally do not expose the inner runtime information. Current anomaly detection techniques for general programs or distributed systems do not apply for smart home devices. To help both device manufactures and users to detect the device anomalies, we propose a general framework named SmartHome-Detector. It first builds a hierarchical automata based behavior model during the testing phase, and uses it as the baseline of IoT device. At runtime, a comprehensive anomaly detection technique is proposed to identify various device anomalies in time. We implement SmartHomeDetector based on the open source smart home system HomeAssistant. Our experiments and case studies on real-world smart home devices show that SmartHomeDetector is effective.

"Verifiable Obstacle Detection Perception of obstacles remains a critical safety concern for autonomous vehicles. Real-world collisions have shown that the autonomy faults leading to fatal collisions originate from obstacle existence detection.

"Dual Machine Learning Models for IoT Quality and Supply Chain Management We have developed dual machine learning models that can be used for predicting an imminent component failure and a longer term fail parts quantity demand for supply chain management. Machine learning techniques were used to select the relevant sensor data that can be used to build the imminent failure model and the long-term failure quantity model. In deployed examples, we observed close to 80% prediction accuracy on failures resulting in close to 2/3 reduction of system outages due to multiple component failures. Different strategies can be used to deploy our predictive maintenance model: from conservative but costly replacing every predicted unit to only removing multiple failure cases to prevent system outages. Our model is flexible and suitable for deployment in production. We observed 90-95% accuracy in predicting quantity of fail parts needed for one quarter ahead of time.

"Sensor Placement and Fault Detection in Electric Motor using Stacked Classifier and Search Algorithm Efficient health monitoring for high power energy systems has become an imperative research area in the field of reliability engineering. Novel systems, such as permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM), have become prominent in many impactful applications. These include but are not limited to propulsion aircraft, electric vehicles, ultra-high-speed elevators, and industrial manufacturing. Therefore, determining an optimal fault detection framework is a significant task. However, due to the newness of this system, there is little to no experimental data to analyze, so finite element simulation data is a necessity for determining the monitoring system. In this study, a design optimization approach is implemented for sensor placement and fault detection on a PMSM with hall effect sensors. This system is prone to short-winding faults, which can lead to catastrophic failures. The proposed method simultaneously determines the optimal placement of sensors while training an optimal classifier. The sensor placement is identified with a genetic algorithm, which uses the classifier's accuracy as the fitness function. In this case, the classifier structure is 'stacked,' which means it combines multiple classification models and makes a final output with a meta-learner. This advanced classifier enables not only fault detection, but the severity of said fault, which is a significant improvement over present methodologies. Overall, this proposed structure converges to a design that has high accuracy for detection of faults, as well as the severity level. © 2024 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85189328614
"Long-Term Prediction of Remaining Useful Life for Industrial IoT Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), a branch of the Internet of Things (IoT) for the industrial sector, plays a vital role in integrating industrial equipment, monitoring equipment health, and improving the overall efficiency of industrial production process. Accurately predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of IIoT equipment is a crucial task in prognostic health management (PHM), which analyzes the degradation trend of industrial equipment to schedule maintenance activi-ties in a timely manner.

During an operational campaign, the Health Monitoring System (HMS) also allows an understanding of how component degradation is affecting the performance of the equipment. Through a structure supported by AI, as data lake and cloud computing, the HMS provides to monitored equipment a fault detection system, early warning alarms to prevent failures and a calculation of the remaining useful life (RUL).The purpose of this paper is to present a prognosis smart system based on AI applied to HMS to support decision-making regarding operational performance of equipment. A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) procedure is developed to continuously analyze the mass of monitoring data generated during the machine operation. The ability to learn the behavior patterns of the collected signals and in this way to be able to make parameter predictions with high accuracy makes artificial neural networks a powerful tool to carry out an effective prognosis. Machine operational parameters are monitored simultaneously by the prognosis smart system. Then, this information is processed by the neural network and used to characterize the machine operational condition. Upon detecting a failure trend for one or more parameters monitored by recognizing deterioration patterns, the prognosis system calculates the remaining useful life (RUL) and allows maintainers to take early actions before the failure occurrence.The proposed methodology is applied as part of a HMS of a hydro generator based on parameters registered in operator inspections routes designed to identify critical equipment degradation. The registered data representing one operational year are used to train the neural network regarding normal and abnormal machine condition. After training, the neural network is able to predict failure trends for monitored temperature parameters of the hydro-generator lubricating system that is critical to support equipment performance.

"Nasa should not use the traditional one-or two-fault tolerance rules to design for reliability NASA has used fault tolerance requirements to improve the safety and reliability of human missions from the beginning of the space program and NASA continues to use them. Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Skylab, Shuttle, and the International Space System ISS all required some systems to be one-or two-fault tolerant. A two-fault tolerant system is one that can operate satisfactorily after experiencing two failures. Two-fault tolerance usually requires providing triple redundancy, one operating system with two online backups or stored spares. A requirement to use one-or two-fault tolerance has been frequently imposed in NASA standards and contracts. In some cases, the fault tolerance approach is ineffective in achieving better reliability at a given cost. Studies by NASA and others have found that the traditionally used rule-based fault tolerance approach has serious limitations and should never be used without being checked by standard reliability and risk analysis. Achieving fault tolerance requires redundancy, and while redundancy is often needed to improve reliability, it can also create serious problems. Redundancy usually requires additional sensors, controllers, logistics, and human operations, and these add new failure modes that are often ignored in reliability analysis. Also, redundancy cannot cure Common Cause Failures (CCF's). Errors in requirements, design, manufacturing, testing, and operations can cause all the redundant units to fail for the same reason. Such CCF's can be a large portion of all the failures, especially for new systems with limited testing and few units, and they limit the reliability that can be achieved using redundancy. Even if all components have many backups, the components with CCF's can consume all the spares quickly.Adding redundancy is intended to improve reliability but using the fault tolerance approach to design redundancy can reduce reliability because of the complexity of the required fault detection and recovery systems. If the newly added failure probabilities and the reliability limiting effect of CCF's are ignored, the achieved reliability can be substantially overestimated. Looked at another way, any oversimplified reliability calculations that ignore the redundancy system failures and CCF's give only a lower bound on the system failure rate. Any ignored failure modes will cause a higher failure rate.Using fault tolerance requirements in design is known to be potentially misleading. NASA should not use fault tolerance requirements to attempt to improve safety and reliability. If they are used because of tradition and binding requirements, reliability analysis using probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) should consider the effects of redundancy system failures and CCF's. The requirement for using fault tolerance is in NASA NPR 8705.2 where its potential harm is limited by a requirement for a previous PRA. The requirement to use fault tolerance is traditional and well accepted, but it is a mistake that it would be very beneficial to correct. NASA should rescind its requirements to use fault tolerance and fully focus on requiring the use of PRA to estimate and reduce risk. © 2023 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85153323233

"Multi-objective Analysis of Condition-based Aircraft Maintenance Strategies using Discrete Event Simulation As aircraft maintenance is transitioning towards data- driven condition-based maintenance (CBM), its cost and performance objectives need to be re-evaluated: how are these objectives related under various CBM strategies?; which objectives are conflicting?; what are the trade-offs between the conflicting objectives?; what is the impact of this transition on aircraft maintenance? We propose a methodology based on discrete-event simulation to analyze CBM of aircraft from the perspective of multiple objectives. The simulation considers an aircraft operations model, systems of multiple, redundant aircraft components, stochastic degradation models for components, and specific CBM strategies. In particular, we analyze two CBM strategies for component replacement, which are based on sensor monitoring and remaining-useful-life prognostics. As objectives for these strategies, we consider the minimization of the number of component replacements, the number of unscheduled replacements, the number of degradation incidents, the delay caused by maintenance, and the mean number of flight cycles to replacements (MCTR). We identify the main conflicting objectives and generate Pareto fronts. We show non-trivial trade-offs between the performance-oriented objectives (the number of degradation incidents and the delay due to maintenance) and cost-oriented objectives (MCTR). In fact, the CBM strategy based on remaining-useful-life prognostics dominates the other strategies in the knee region of the Pareto fronts. This implies that the transition towards data-driven CBM strategies can reduce the cost while maintaining the performance. Moreover, the proposed methodology is readily applicable to analyze general aircraft systems and other maintenance strategies. © 2021 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85123057379

To develop a robust machine learning model that can diagnose all the fault modes of a vertical motor-driven pump, data capturing the unique signature of each fault mode is required.

"Sensor Implementation For Saltwater Ingress Detection In Deep Sea Actuators Subsea oil and gas Xmas trees are critical components of offshore drilling and production systems. These structures are installed on the seabed and serve as connectors between subsea wells and production facilities on the surface. Xmas trees control the flow of oil and gas from the well, allowing operators to regulate production and implement safety measures. They typically consist of actuators, valves, chokes, sensors and other equipment to manage pressure and ensure the efficient extraction of hydrocarbons from beneath the ocean floor. These actuators can be either hydraulic, electro-mechanic or all- electric. A reliable design of the actuators is mandatory as in the event of an emergency a safety-relevant function needs to be performed to prevent major environmental damage. All these actuators are permanently exposed to the surrounding sea water and are therefore at risk of saltwater intrusion, which can result in accelerated degradation. Hence the detection of saltwater ingress enables better diagnostics, providing for increased safety and higher availability due to predictive maintenance. Within this paper an innovative sensor design for the in-situ detection of saltwater ingress in a subsea all-electric actuator is proposed. In these actuators, the motor and gearbox are installed into an oil-filled chamber, which adapts to the ambient pressure. This saltwater ingress leads to the formation of saltwater in oil emulsion. Throughout the research two sensor geometries have been tested with different excitation methods to detect saltwater within such an emulsion. The testing was performed using a Design of Experiments. With respect to the relevant environmental parameters in the deep sea, measurements from 0 °C up to 80°C were included in the experimental design and depths of 3000 m have been simulated by testing with pressures of up to 330 bar. In addition, the vulnerability of the measurement principle to electromagnetic interference was tested. The information obtained by this sensor can be used for advanced diagnosis of the health state of the entire system.

"Artificial Butterfly Optimization based Cluster Head Selection with Energy Efficient Data Aggregation model for Heterogeneous WSN Environment The WSN is a new and urgent technology with many potential uses, including but not limited to health security, environmental monitoring, etc. Due to lower battery capacity, WSN has a restricted-energy resource. In order to solve the issue of unequal energy consumption among nodes, it is necessary to choose a sensor node from a cluster with more than enough power to make up for the weaker nodes. This paper develops the idea of heterogeneous WSN (H-WSN), which provides supplementary energy to the heterogeneity network. One method that has shown promise in overcoming this difficulty is the clustering technique, which optimizes energy consumption and extends the useful life of a sensor network. Even if the existing approaches function well, the computational complexity may rise due to the usage of a single mobile sink in their studies. As an alternative to communication among each CH and sink through a separate hop, the network uses Multiple Mobile Sinks (MMSs). The combination of the data collection and aggregation mechanism (DCA) and artificial butterfly optimization (ABO) based on CH selection allows for energy-efficient data transfer using MMSs in H-WSN. The CH assortment uses the distance parameter, remaining energy, and regular energy for the suggested energy efficiency model. The NS2 platform hosts the final product of the projected H-WSN. The suggested ABO-CH-DCA approach is superior to the baseline protocols in simulations on various measures, including throughput, network lifespan, remaining energy, dead nodes, and live nodes. © 2023 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85153581297

"World-in-the-Loop Simulation for Autonomous Systems Validation Simulation is at the core of validating autonomous systems (AS), enabling the detection of faults at a lower cost and earlier in the development life cycle. However, simulation can only produce an approximation of the real world, leading to a gap between simulation and reality where undesirable system behaviors can go unnoticed. To address that gap, we present a novel approach, world-in-the-loop (WIL) simulation, which integrates sensing data from simulation and the real world to provide the AS with a mixed-reality. The approach executes multiple instances of the AS in parallel, one in the real world and at least one in simulation, performs configurable transformations, filtering, and merging operations on the body of sensed data in order to integrate it, and provides the pipelines to distribute the original sensor data and the integrated sensor data back to the executing AS. We present a study on multiple scenarios and two simulators that demonstrates how WIL reduces the simulation-reality gap and increases the chances of exposing failures before deployment. © 2021 IEEE",2-s2.0-85121793783
"Fault tolerant multi-sensor data fusion for vehicle localisation using maximum correntropy unscented information filter and α-Rényi divergence the paper presents a fault-tolerant multi-sensor fusion approach with Fault Detection and Exclusion (FDE) based on information theory. The Maximum Correntropy Criterion (MCC) in Unscented Information Filter (UIF) form, called (MCCUIF), is used as estimator. The Unscented Transformation (UT) provides an efficient tool to restrict the non-linear state estimation problem. However, the UIF works well with Gaussian noises, where its performance may decrease when dealing with non-Gaussian noises. The MCC is used to deal with non-Gaussian noises (for instance shot noises or Gaussian mixture noises). For detection and exclusion of erroneous measurements, a residual is designed using a- Rényi Divergence (a-RD) between a priori and a posteriori probabilities distributions. Then α-Rényi criterion (a-Rc) is used in the decision part of the proposed approach in order to calculate an adaptive threshold for FDE. In order to target both high integrity and accuracy of the navigation function of an autonomous vehicle in stringent environments (urban canyon, forests...), this paper presents a tightly coupled architecture by merging raw data of a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) with odometer (odo) measurements through the proposed approach. The main contributions of this paper are: - the proposition of a multisensor fusion approach using MCCUIF, - the development of an FDE method using a residual based on a-RD with an adequate choice of a value and adaptive thresholding, - the validation of the proposed approach with real experimental data. © 2020 International Society of Information Fusion (ISIF).",2-s2.0-85092701356

"Leveraging Telematics Data for Estimation of Gear Damage and Residual Useful Life This study explores the utilization of telematics data to advance predictive maintenance and optimize operational efficiency in industrial farm machinery. It addresses the current gap in the Controller Area Network (CAN) Signals by demonstrating how engine parameters such as torque and speed, augmented by the Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC) map, can estimate driveline gear damage and predict residual useful life (RUL). By integrating mechanical engineering principles with advanced analytics, the research develops cycle and torque matrices from telematics-derived data (engine speed, wheel speed, fuel rate) to quantify the total cycles and torque experienced by each gear. The analysis employs specific mechanical equations to compute bending (Db) and pitting damages (Dp1, Dp2), providing precise assessments of gear health. This approach not only identifies variations in gear damage across different machines but also correlates usage patterns to gear wear, informing tailored maintenance recommendations. By understanding how driving behaviors impact gear health, proactive maintenance interventions can be scheduled to prevent unexpected breakdowns and optimize overall reliability. Furthermore, the study's predictive maintenance strategies enable accurate forecasting of future maintenance needs, facilitating timely interventions that enhance gear performance and extend driveline component lifespan.

"Partial discharge monitoring and arc protection based on multispectral detection in high voltage switchgear As one of the most important equipment in power system, the safe and stable operation of high voltage switchgear directly affect the reliable operation of the system. At present, the relay protection system used by power sector can respond to extreme arcs immediately, but it can't give reliable warnings of intermittent discharges in the early stage of arc development, which means it can only prevent power system from further damage, rather than avoid the arcing faults in the early time. Therefore, it is necessary to propose a method that can take into account early PD warning and reliable protection to reduce the damage of high voltage switchgear. In this paper, the activity of PD and arc in the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared spectra is explored by simultaneously measuring optical signals of partial discharge and arc discharge in the three bands using SiPM sensor.

"IFP-ADAC: A Two-stage Interpretable Fault Prediction Model for Multivariate Time Series Fault prediction is critically important for many mobile equipments such as vehicles, ships and spacecrafts. Sensors deployed on these equipments continuously collect the status data, which are usually multivariate time series data. It is challenging to accurately predict the failure of the equipments based on the generated multivairate time series due to the complex correlations among the variables and the dynamic operation conditions. Though many methods have been proposed, they are not effective to provide an interpretable and accurate fault prediction result.

Specially, we first design an anomaly detection module based on Generative Adversarial Nets due to the lack of samples. The generator captures the correlations among multiple variables and the temporal dependency within each variable jointly. Second, we design an anomaly accumulation model based on LSTM to capture the anomaly growth pattern, and the attention mechanism has been introduced to consider the severity of the detected anomalies. Compared with the end-to-end methods, our two-stage fault prediction method based on anomaly detection and accumulation has better interpretability.

"Optimal RUL estimation: A state-of-art digital twin application A real world Industrial IoT set up has paved way for simultaneous monitoring of several sensors at their unique sampling rates. This has realized the need for artificial intelligence tools for robust data processing. However, the large size of input data requires real time monitoring and synchronization for online analysis. As the star concept behind the Industry 4.0 wave, a digital twin is a virtual, multi-scale and probabilistic simulation to mirror the performance of its physical counterpart and serve the product lifecycle in a virtual space. Evidently, a digital twin can proactively identify potential issues with its corresponding real twin. Thus, it is best suited for enabling a physics-based and data-driven model fusion to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of the components. Traditional RUL prediction approaches have assumed either an exponential or linear degradation trend with a fixed curve shape to build a Health Index (HI) model. Such an assumption may not be useful for multi-sensor systems or cases where sensor data is available intermittently. A common constraint in the industry is irregular sensor data collection. The resulting asynchronous time series of the sporadic data needs to be an accurate representation of the component's HI when constructing a degradation model. In this paper, we extend the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) technique to generate RUL prediction within a digital twin framework as a means of synchronization with changing operational states. More specifically, we first use LSTM encoder-decoder (LSTM-ED) to train a multilayered neural network and reconstruct the sensor data time series corresponding to a healthy state. The resulting reconstruction error can be used to capture patterns in input data time series and estimate HI of training and testing sets. Using a time lag to record similarity between the HI curves, a weighted average of the final RUL estimation is obtained. The described empirical approach is evaluated on publicly available engine degradation dataset with run-to-failure information. Results indicate a high RUL estimation accuracy with greater error reduction rate. This demonstrates wide applicability of the discussed methodology to various industries where event data is scarce for the application of only data-driven techniques. © 2020 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85090435192

"Generative model for sensor fault detection in nuclear power plant accidents The state of nuclear power plants (NPPs) is monitored through sensor values obtained from field measurements. These measurements provide situational information to plant operators and activate mechanical components autonomously. However, inconsistent sensor measurements can be a significant source of danger, as they can hinder nuclear safety and worsen NPP accidents. In nuclear accidents, the automated safety system may be interrupted due to sensor faults, moreover, critical human errors could occur during mitigation tasks. Accidents in NPPs typically involve reactor shutdown and drastic physical changes in the entire system, with different patterns of change depending on the accident type.

However, enhanced pattern recognition performance is required for detecting anomalies in accident situations. To address this issue, deep learning models such as generative models, including generative-adversarial networks, variational autoencoder, and denoising diffusion models, have demonstrated high performance in pattern recognition tasks. To create a reliable and authentic sensor anomaly detection system, the authors developed a signal reconstruction structure using these generative models. The system generates signals identical to input signals and classifies errors using residual analysis of inputs and outputs. We trained and tested the deep learning model using typical accident scenario data extracted from the NPP simulator.

"A Precise and Reliable Engine Knock Detection Utilizing Meta Classifier An increase in temperature and pressure can cause spontaneous ignition of the air-fuel mixture in internal combustion engines, reducing engine efficiency, lifespan, and increasing air pollution. Typically, to predict and detect this effect, a knock sensor is used, which has a low detection accuracy due to the engine vibration noise. In this work, a machine learning model based on a meta-classifier is proposed and implemented for real-time fault detection in combustion engines. First, actual knock sensor data are recorded at diverse engine speeds from our engine test bench. The local dataset is preprocessed and scaled. Then, 30 different features in the time and frequency domains are investigated. Dimensionality of data is reduced employing recursive feature elimination. Then, a stacking classifier is utilized to address the classification problem by combining several classification models through the use of a metaclassifier. To enhance the assessment of the experimental outcomes in knock detection, k-fold cross-validation is utilized to gauge the model's performance with new data. The result shows the proposed method has around 12% higher accuracy during 5 cross folds with least amount of variation. Finally, the model is implemented on an ARM MCU and showed an execution time of 8.9ms, which validates its reliability for real-time operation.  © 2024 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85198537220
"Poster Abstract: Towards a Predictive Model for Improved Placement of Solar-Powered Urban Sensing Nodes In a world driven by data, cities are increasingly interested in deploying networks of smart city devices for urban and environmental monitoring. To be successful, these networks must be reliable, low-cost, and easy to install and maintain - criteria that are all significantly affected by the design choices around power and can seemingly be satisfied with the use of solar energy. However, solar power is not ubiquitous throughout cities, making it difficult to know where to place nodes to avoid charging issues and thus potentially increasing maintenance costs. This abstract describes the development of a machine learning model that predicts whether any arbitrary location in a city will have solar charging issues. Using data from a large-scale real-world solar-powered sensor deployment in Chicago, Illinois and open data about building location and height, the binary classification model outputs the probability of adequate solar charging at a node location with 77% accuracy on the held-out test set. This work lays the foundation for those deploying future solar-powered urban sensor networks to have more confidence in the reliability of their chosen node locations. © 2024 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85197743817
"Reliability and Energy Balanced Computation Resource Allocation Mechanism in Federated Learning System for AI-Enabled IoT Businesses With the advancement and widespread adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) technology, machine learning (ML) can be leveraged in au-tomated factories to enable intelligent robot fault detection and recognition. As an emerging distributed machine learning framework, federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while safeguarding the privacy of user data. However, FL encounters various challenges, including the lack of stable energy supply to maintain continuous training and the existence of malicious terminals in the system. These situations could result in issues such as free-riding attacks and robots running out of energy during the training process. Hence, this paper presents a reliability and energy balanced computation resource allocation mechanism in FL system for IoT businesses. Firstly, a training latency and model contribution based reputation evaluation model is proposed to reveal the reliability of IoT terminals. Then, a training client reliable selection and delayed admission strategy is proposed, which takes into account both the reputation and energy consumption, aiming at enabling terminals with high-quality data and low energy capacity to keep contributing to the model during the later training stage. Especially, we integrate reputation and computing capability of IoT terminals to decide the freshness level of the allocated FL global model, which can effectively defend against free-riding attacks. The simulation results verify that the proposed mechanism outperforms non-delayed/partial-delayed admission mechanisms in terms of model quality and system stability. © 2023 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85187350941

"Exploiting Temporal Data Diversity for Detecting Safety-critical Faults in AV Compute Systems Silent data corruption caused by random hardware faults in autonomous vehicle (AV) computational elements is a significant threat to vehicle safety. Previous research has explored design diversity, data diversity, and duplication techniques to detect such faults in other safety-critical domains. However, these are challenging to use for AVs in practice due to significant resource overhead and design complexity. We propose, DiverseAV, a low-cost data-diversity-based redundancy technique for detecting safety-critical random hardware faults in computational elements. DiverseAV introduces data-diversity between the redundant agents by exploiting the temporal semantic consistency available in the AV sensor data. DiverseAV is a black-box technique that offers a plug-and-play solution as it requires no knowledge of the internals of the AI agent responsible for executing driving decisions, requiring little to no modification to the agent itself for achieving high coverage of transient and permanent hardware faults. It is commercially viable because it avoids software modifications to agents that are costly in terms of development and testing time. Specifically, DiverseAV distributes the sensor data between the two software agents in a round-robin manner. As a result, the sensor data for two consecutive time steps are semantically similar in terms of their worldview but significantly different at the bit level, thus ensuring the state and data diversity between the two agents necessary for detecting faults. We demonstrate DiverseAV using an open-source self-driving AI agent which is controlling a car in an open-source world simulator.  © 2022 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85136327862

"Stator Inter- Turn Fault Diagnosis in Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor With the need for perfect machinery functions in an optimum and cost-effective way, an obvious consequence is a huge need of monitoring those systems to detect the faults at a very early stage. In the context of electrical machine applications, it has been noticed that permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) are being preferred in many cases because of it's higher energy efficiency compared to induction motors. Hence online monitoring and diagnostics of these motors have become very important. Motor current signature analysis (MCSA) in time-frequency domain has been proposed for the diagnosis of stator inter-turn fault because with MCSA there is no need for placing sensors on the machine itself and faults can be diagnosed from far away from the machine by analyzing the stator's current signature.

"Fault Detection and Diagnostics Using the Mahalanobis-Taguchi System Fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) refers to identifying the faulty operations of a machine and then determining the cause or causes of the fault. FDD is an important use case of Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT) technology. This paper introduces the Mahalanobis-Taguchi System (MTS) method, which is an important technique used in FDD. The MTS method was proposed by Genichi Taguchi for diagnosing multivariate data. It has been successfully used for FDD and quality control in a variety of industries, including electrical power, chemical, and aerospace. The MTS method involves the following three steps.Step 1: First, the multivariate sensor data from a machine's normal operations (or fault-free operations) are collected. The sensor variables are standardized, and the Mahalanobis distance (MD) of the observations from the center is calculated. These MD values are used to define what is referred to as the Mahalanobis space of the normal observations. The MTS method uses the Mahalanobis space as a scale of reference for identifying outliers. This step can be considered the model-training step.Step 2: Second, new observations are scored by calculating their MD values. During scoring, the observations are first scaled using the mean and standard deviation of sensor variables by using the machine's normal operations data, which were collected in step 1. The MD computation in this step uses the correlation matrix of the normal operations data. An observation is considered to be an outlier, or the presence of a fault is indicated, if that observation's MD value is higher than the typical MD value of observations in normal or fault-free operations.Step 3: Third is the model interpretability step, in which fault diagnosis is performed by identifying important variables. For such a determination, a design-of-experiments approach is adopted using orthogonal arrays and the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio.Because the MTS method is an interpretable outlier detection technique, it is very attractive for FDD. A machine operator can use the output of the MTS method and take timely corrective actions. This paper introduces the MTS method for FDD and evaluates this method by using several datasets. We include a detailed discussion of the advantages of the method, as well as its limitations. Then we introduce a new kernel-based MTS method that can be useful when data from normal operations of the machine are multimodal and/or non-Gaussian. © 2022 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85156231158

"A New Unsupervised Feature Extraction Method for Fault Diagnosis of Machines In order to accurately predict the current health condition of rotating machinery tools, multiple sensors are mounted on rotating machines to capture diverse fault signals. These raw signals are then subjected to statistical feature extraction to predict the bearing's health condition. However, variations in the information of collected sensor signals occur due to sensor placement and structural/environmental noises that potentially lead to inconsistent prediction results.

"Mining Multivariate Discrete Event Sequences for Knowledge Discovery and Anomaly Detection Modern physical systems deploy large numbers of sensors to record at different time-stamps the status of different systems components via measurements such as temperature, pressure, speed, but also the component's categorical state. Depending on the measurement values, there are two kinds of sequences: continuous and discrete. For continuous sequences, there is a host of state-of-the-art algorithms for anomaly detection based on time-series analysis, but there is a lack of effective methodologies that are tailored specifically to discrete event sequences. This paper proposes an analytics framework for discrete event sequences for knowledge discovery and anomaly detection. During the training phase, the framework extracts pairwise relationships among discrete event sequences using a neural machine translation model by viewing each discrete event sequence as a 'natural language'. The relationship between sequences is quantified by how well one discrete event sequence is 'translated' into another sequence. These pairwise relationships among sequences are aggregated into a multivariate relationship graph that clusters the structural knowledge of the underlying system and essentially discovers the hidden relationships among discrete sequences. This graph quantifies system behavior during normal operation. During testing, if one or more pairwise relationships are violated, an anomaly is detected. The proposed framework is evaluated on two real-world datasets: a proprietary dataset collected from a physical plant where it is shown to be effective in extracting sensor pairwise relationships for knowledge discovery and anomaly detection, and a public hard disk drive dataset where its ability to effectively predict upcoming disk failures is illustrated. © 2020 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85090402554

"A Stitch in Time Saves Nine: Enabling Early Anomaly Detection with Correlation Analysis Early detection of anomalies from sensor-based Multivariate Time Series (MTS) is vital for timely response to the signs of operation failures and errors. While many interesting works have been done toward solving this problem, existing methods typically detect such anomalies as outliers by making certain assumptions that allow efficient and easily understandable solutions to be used but might not be applicable to time series. Meanwhile, unsupervised deep learning-based methods might be highly accurate but often lead to challenges for real-time industrial scenarios, e.g., requiring a large amount of training data and producing unstable output.In this paper, we propose a new approach, CAD, to detect anomalies from sensor-based MTS. We aim to leverage the latent correlations between sensors by first converting the MTS into a sequence of Time-Series Graphs (TSGs) that connect sensors to their highly correlated neighbors within a certain time period. Then, we track the unusual correlation variations between sensors on the sequence of TSGs. By analyzing the correlation variations with a theoretical guarantee, CAD can detect the time of occurrence for the anomalies simultaneously with the sensors that are affected as early as possible.Extensive experiments over eight real-world datasets show that CAD is effective, scalable, yet stable compared to nine state-of-the-art methods while keeping comparable efficiency. Moreover, it maintains above 85% accuracy on large-scale datasets with over 1,000 sensors. Notably, CAD can determine relevant sensors in a very early stage of the anomaly so that timely predictive maintenance can be done.

"SensorBFT: Fault-Tolerant Target Localization Using Voronoi Diagrams and Approximate Agreement The target localization primitive is used for detecting and locating an adverse event called a target in a geographic area. This versatile primitive is applicable in the physical security domain (e.g., detecting intruders in an area) or for disaster preemption, such as detecting ignition events of forest fires. Prior systems implemented this primitive over large areas by deploying a network of sensor devices, which detect changes in a specific physical parameter like pressure or temperature induced by a target. However, these systems are not designed for use in adverse environments where one or more sensors can behave in a faulty manner. While many algorithms in the distributed systems literature can be naively used to implement target localization in a fault-tolerant manner, these approaches are energy-intensive as they use computationally expensive cryptographic operations not appropriate for resource-constrained sensors. We present SENSORBFT, an energy-efficient, fault-tolerant approach for target localization. SENSORBFT uses a novel asynchronous approximate agreement protocol that enables correct sensors to achieve an approximate consensus in the presence of faulty sensors. Sensors fulfill their energy budgets by tuning the precision and accuracy of localization, where precision is the difference between honest sensors' outputs and accuracy is the difference between an honest sensor's output and the target's true location. In optimal scenarios, this protocol reduces communication from O (n3) to O (n2) messages per round, where n is the number of sensors sharing coverage over a piece of area.

"Predictive Maintenance Application in Healthcare Effective maintenance management of medical technology influences healthcare service quality delivery and the profitability of healthcare facilities. The objective of this study is to review recent research focused on medical equipment predictive maintenance. Predictive maintenance is a term that describes the use of sensors and forecasting techniques to anticipate when a device or machine would fail, so that preemptive measures can be undertaken to lessen the effects of an impending failure and subsequently improve service quality. In healthcare, this mostly pertains to medical devices and can be an invaluable tool that would save medical institutions money and time, and more importantly, mitigate adverse effects to patients that require these devices. Predictive maintenance is a means of providing some control in an otherwise chaotic and arbitrary industry; doctors, nurses, and administrators often do not see the value in repairing or replacing a device before it fails, especially if it were not crucial in their day-to-day or emergency operation. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of work that pertains to predictive maintenance in healthcare published between 2014 and 2019. The works reviewed were published in scientific journals and conferences, and for each one, we were interested in (1) what predictive maintenance techniques were used, such as Internet of Things (IoT) or deep learning (DL), (2) what devices/equipment were used to obtain results and (3) whether or not they were medical devices/healthcare-related, if not, how could this application apply to healthcare and (4) whether or not predictive maintenance is proven to be more effective than simply waiting for the lifespan of the device to come to its end. The reviewed papers all showed great potential in the techniques used for predictive maintenance and showed promising results for a variety of medical devices.

This paper presents a hybrid model based on the combination of embedded important feature selection technique and shallow and deep (SD) convolutional neural network (EIFS-SDCNN) to accurately detect and diagnose chiller faults.

"Coolant Pump Predictive Data Analytics from Signatures Generated by the Recursive Short Time Fast Fourier Transform Although a nuclear reactor is a hostile environment for sensors and signal transmissions, the reactor core is amenable to acoustic communication. An acoustic measurement infrastructure installed at the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) nozzle trench area records acoustic signals that can capture reactor operating states. The distinct states produce unique signatures that can be identified and tracked using data processing and data analytics. The infrastructure relies on acoustic transmission through ATR in-pile structural components, piping, and coolant that transmit acoustically modified signals generated by the coolant pumps.

The RSTFFT is applied to ATR data to understand the vibration levels and signatures for different operating regimes as displayed by the spectrogram. The combination of coolant pumps for normal and high-power operation generate unique signatures. These acoustic signatures are used to develop machine learning approaches to automatically classify operating regimes.

"DETECTIF : Unified Detection & Correction of IoT Faults in Smart Homes This paper tackles the problem of detecting a comprehensive set of sensor faults that can occur in IoT-instrumented smart homes customized to infer Activities of Daily Living (ADL) from the activation of sensor sets. Specifically, sensors can suffer faults that (a) span durations that vary between several seconds to hours, (b) can result in both missing or false-alarm sensor-events. Previous fault detection approaches are geared primarily to identify missing faults (absence of sensor readings) of a permanent (very long-lived) nature, or sporadic false-alarm events. We propose DetectIF, a fault-detection framework that detects faults of varying time duration, and identifies both missing and false-alarm sensor events. DetectIF's key novelties include developing rules capturing spatiotemporal correlations among sensors and augmenting those rules with statistical properties of such sensor-specific behavior. To test DetectIF under a variety of fault behavior, we develop a unified fault framework where the tuning of a couple of parameters allows us to generate and inject faults of desired type and duration into an underlying sensor stream. Experiments with such comprehensive fault data shows that DetectIF achieves 82-95% fault-detection accuracy, improving precision by a huge amount (33-66%) over competitive, state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, we demonstrate the benefits of applying DetectIF on unmodified, benchmark smart home datasets: it is able to detect additional likely faults that prior fault detection approaches miss, and thus consequently achieve an average of 30% higher ADL recognition accuracy compared to prior state-of-the-art fault detection techniques.  © 2020 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85096603209

To effectively address these issues there is a pressing need for innovative maintenance strategies that enable early fault detection and rapid response. This paper presents a diagnostic approach that uses acoustic monitoring and Edge-AI techniques to detect failures in urban water pipelines through hydrophone sensor recordings. The methodology employed in this study involves extracting both time-domain and frequency-domain features to classify various pipeline faults using three distinct Machine Learning (ML) models: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Furthermore, we implemented the processing method on an embedded platform, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. The results of this study reveal an average fault detection accuracy of 96.83% with a fast response time of 1.055 seconds.  © 2024 IEEE.",2-s2.0-105001567287
"(POSTER) Navigating the Unknown: Anomaly Detection in Sensor Nodes Based on Event Traces In wireless sensor networks, post-deployment is-sues persist despite extensive testing, primarily due to unpredictable environmental factors and limited debugging tools for resource-constrained end nodes. This challenge is particularly pronounced in remote applications such as extraterrestrial habitats. To address this, we propose a runtime anomaly detection and diagnosis method for resource-constrained sensor nodes. A key advantage of our approach is its ability to learn expected behavior from historical data, eliminating the need for explicit behavior modeling, unlike other runtime fault detection methods. Our method comprises three main components: logging, detection, and diagnosis. We log event traces on the sensor nodes, enabling activity tracking down to the variable level. For anomaly detection, we explore various methods, including state transition, execution interval analysis, and clustering. Subsequently, diagnosis is performed using the logged event traces.  © 2024 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85202353773

"Addressing Class Imbalance in Aeroengine Fault Detection Data-driven approach to fault detection in aeroengine has received considerable attention owing to the availability of engine sensor information for locating and classifying faults. In building models for aeroengine fault detection, class imbalance is a prominent issue. This is due to the fewer number of faults from operational flights and the cost of acquiring them. Notable resampling techniques have been proposed in addressing this class imbalance dilemma. The process involves small incremental iteration of resampling ratios (i.e., the ratio of the number of samples in the minority class over that of the majority class) on a machine learning classifier in a broad search-space, until an acceptable performance is reached. Finding the ideal resampling ratio that guarantees an optimal model performance is particularly necessary in cases where the class samples are distributed in close neighbourhood. However, the process incurs considerable resource expense. This study undertakes an investigation into resampling techniques for tackling class imbalance in aeroengine fault detection. Four ensemble tree learners were considered, while examining the influence of different resampling ratios on the model performance. In determining the best resampling ratio, we propose a lightweight, two-step approach that iteratively locates the search-space that guarantees the optimal model performance. The experimental findings showed a decrease of up to 83.5% in the computational cost in determining the resampling ratio, along with a notable improvement of up to 5.5% in model performance. © 2023 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85190096760

"EM Fault Injection-Induced Clock Glitches: From Mechanism Analysis to Novel Sensor Design This paper introduces a novel sensor that is capable of detecting faults injected by electromagnetic disturbances. The sensor has been designed from an understanding of the physical mechanisms of ElectroMagnetic Fault Injection (EMFI). A recent study has identified an EMFI mechanism based on the timing violation fault model, which highlights the coexistence of two distinct mechanisms: electromagnetic disturbances that are coupled to the target's power distribution network, which can cause timing faults by extending the propagation time of logic gates beyond the clock period, and disturbances that are coupled to the target's clock distribution network, which can cause timing constraint violations due to EMFI-induced voltage glitches within the target's clock tree. Building on this work, we have investigated the mechanism of EMFI-induced clock glitches, providing useful insights for designing a new sensor.

"Cloud Condition Monitoring Platform for Steel Rolling Mill Machines Several factories incorporate preventive maintenance policies to avoid wear and tear failures and increase equipment lifetime. However, equipment failures often occur from multiple process factors and are not easily predictable. Industry 4.0 proposes the implementation of condition monitoring (CM) systems reporting alarms when measurements are outside the sensor operational ranges or also by predictive models of equipment failures. In this context there are multiple CM applications, however some of them fall under the exclusivity of their own brand, they simply work for a group of initially configured sensors and do not allow the user to add more devices to the application. For this reason, this work proposes a local Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT) architecture for the collection, by means of the S7 protocol, and transmission, by means of the MQTT protocol, of the sensors measurements from the factory to the cloud. Moreover, a new architecture is proposed in the AWS cloud capable of capturing and storing sensor measurements to a non-sql database. This cloud architecture hosts a CM web interface, which permits visualizing past sensor measurements and in real-time. The CM interface permits the user to add new devices without limitation of brands or communication protocol of the physical equipment. Finally, an alarm system was implemented to operate ranges and risk thresholds.  © 2021 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85124097269
"Time Series Transformer for Long Term Rainfall Forecasting Towards Water Distribution Management in Smart Cities. Infrastructure for managing and distributing water in the traditional manner is somewhat outdated. As a result of incorporating information and communication technologies into the current system, a smart water management system has been developed. The smart water management system uses a number of different technologies to monitor and sense water leaks, theft, and delivery. The supervisory control and data acquisition system SCADA, which shows that the distribution side is being monitored less, has very little impact at the pump house level. The development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has made it possible to connect a large number of monitoring devices to the Internet, which will be more beneficial for automating water delivery and leak detection. As a result, a fog-integrated IoT-based smart water distribution and monitoring system for a smart city is proposed. This system will handle customer utilization, water theft detection, water quality control, fault prediction, fault localization, and rainfall prediction. Fog and cloud computing enable these system processes in order to achieve effective control action. In this work first, we apply the transformer for the rainfall prediction and then use ant colony optimization for optimization of the water distribution process.  © 2023 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85184977496
"Anomaly Detection for Industrial Sensors Using Transformers Anomaly detection is a critical task in many domains, including the Internet of Things (IoT), where large volumes of sensor data are generated from various devices. Traditional methods based on domain knowledge often fail to capture the complex correlations among the variables and time series. Therefore, there is a need for robust and efficient anomaly detection methods that can learn from data. Recently, deep learning models have shown promising results in detecting anomalies in multivariate time-series data. In particular, transformer-based models and convolutional networks have gained popularity due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies and extract meaningful features from high-dimensional data. In this study, we propose a transformer-based framework for anomaly detection in IoT systems. Our model employs dynamic graph attention to capture the complex correlations among variables and time series, and a transformer architecture with parallel processing ability to extract multidimensional features for downstream prediction tasks. We evaluate our model on several publicly available datasets and demonstrate its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. In summary, our proposed framework is a promising approach for anomaly detection in sensor data for industry predictive maintenance, which can potentially reduce downtime, increase efficiency, and save costs.  © 2023 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85185003573
"Feature consistency anomaly detection method based on adversarial training deep autoencoder Real-time and accurate fault diagnosis is essential to ensure the safe and stable operation of industrial systems. However, most of the monitoring data collected by sensors in actual industrial sites are obtained when the system is operating in a healthy state, so it is difficult to obtain abnormal data with fault labels. Therefore, it is of great practical significance to carry out research on unsupervised anomaly detection during equipment operation. This paper proposed an anomaly detection method based on the consistency of features of adversarial training deep autoencoder. This method fed two random training sets into two deep autoencoder network, and designed loss functions by the error of input and output consistency and the error defined by the degree of feature inconsistency. Then the network parameters are updated by back-propagation through adversarial training of the two deep autoencoder network, and then the anomaly score is obtained by using the weighted sum of the generated and discriminated losses, and finally unsupervised anomaly detection is performed by the discrepancy of the anomaly score. The efficiency of the proposed method is verified by the data set of gearboxes.  © 2022 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85147963466
"Recent Research and Applications in Variational Autoencoders for Industrial Prognosis and Health Management: A Survey Whether in the industrial, medical, or real-world domains, more and more data are being collected. The common particularity of all these application domains is that a great part of this data is mostly unlabeled. Thus, designing a learning model with a minimum of labeled data represents a major challenge in the coming years. A particular emphasis has recently been put on unsupervised learning methods based on the idea of autoencoding. The objective of these methods is twofold: to reduce the dimensionality of the input space and to reconstruct the original observation from this lower dimensional representation space. The variational form of these autoencoders, called the Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), is particularly successful in almost all application areas. This enthusiasm comes from the fact that VAEs allow to take advantage of the theoretical foundations of the Variational Bayesian methods and the learning capabilities of artificial neural networks. This review paper gives to the PHM community a synthesis of the latest publications in the PHM domain using the VAEs related to four topics: 1) Data-Driven Soft Sensors for missing values and data outliers, 2) reconstruction error for fault detection, 3) resampling approach for imbalanced data generation and minority class and 4) the variational embedding as PHM preprocessing pipelines and data transformations. After a review of the theoretical foundations and some practical tricks to succeed the implementation of the VAEs in industrial applications, the four main topics used to exploit the VAEs in the PHM domain are detailed. Finally, a global view of the research done at the research institute of Hydro-Québec regarding the diagnosis and failure detection of hydro-generators with VAEs are presented.  © 2022 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85134895590
"A Temporal Anomaly Detection System for Vehicles utilizing Functional Working Groups and Sensor Channels A modern vehicle fitted with sensors, actuators, and Electronic Control Units (ECUs) can be divided into several operational subsystems called Functional Working Groups (FWGs). Examples of these FWGs include the engine system, transmission, fuel system, brakes, etc. Each FWG has associated sensor-channels that gauge vehicular operating conditions. This data rich environment is conducive to the development of Predictive Maintenance (PdM) technologies. Undercutting various PdM technologies is the need for robust anomaly detection models that can identify events or observations which deviate significantly from the majority of the data and do not conform to a well defined notion of normal vehicular operational behavior. In this paper, we introduce the Vehicle Performance, Reliability, and Operations (VePRO) dataset and use it to create a multi-phased approach to anomaly detection. Utilizing Temporal Convolution Networks (TCN), our anomaly detection system can achieve 96% detection accuracy and accurately predicts 91% of true anomalies.

"Single-phase Ground Fault Detection Method Based on Phase-current of Deeply Fusion Switch Most of my country's power distribution networks are small-current grounding systems. With the transformation of the power system under the goal of carbon neutrality, a high proportion of new energy will gradually be integrated into the distribution network. When a single-phase ground fault occurs, the conventional transient line selection method based on zero-sequence voltage and zero-sequence current is easy to misjudge after the polarity change caused by power flow conversion. Due to the characteristics of high-precision three-phase current sensors of the primary and secondary deeply fusion switch, this paper conducts grounding detection based on the different fault characteristics of the three-phase currents of the faulty line and the non-faulty line. The period integral method is used to compare the amplitude and phasor of each phase to complete the ground fault detection. This method can be adapted to the grounding detection after the power flow is transferred. Combined with field application cases, it is proved that the proposed scheme can effectively realize ground fault location and isolation, and has universal applicability and economy. © 2021 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85128025756
"Graph Neural Networks for Chemical Process Fault Diagnosis Based on Hybrid Variable Feature Learning Graph-based data representation allows us to take into account not only the behavior of each sensor signal but also the correlations and hidden relationships between them. Therefore, using graph neural networks can achieve better results in fault diagnosis. However previous fault detection methods tend to focus only on continuous variables, but industrial processes usually contain both continuous and discrete variables. To utilize this information, we propose a method named graph neural networks for fault diagnosis based on hybrid variable feature learning (HV-GNN). The method continuous discrete variables through a self-attention mechanism and then feeds them into the graph neural network as nodes along with continuous variables for fault diagnosis.

"Automated Faults Diagnosis Framework for Rotating Machines Under Combined Faults Scenarios Ongoing technological advancements have made it possible to design very compact industrial rotating machines that offer significantly better performances with regards to conservation of energy and materials. Consequently, such compactness implies that several failure modes are becoming more intertwined, thereby increasing downtime associated with faults classification and diagnosis. Data fusion approaches such as coherent composite spectra (CCS) and poly coherent composite spectra (pCCS) have proven very useful for reducing overall faults classification times through the harmonisation of condition monitoring data from multiple locations into a single CCS or pCCS. This approach has made it possible for owners of physical industrial assets (PIA) to swiftly ascertain the condition of their assets without necessarily possessing significant expertise in rotating machine condition monitoring. As useful as the results of the techniques are, they have been solely applied for individualized or singular faults. However, rotating machines faults seldom occur in isolation, which makes it imperative to examine the proficiency of CCS and pCCS features under combined faults scenarios. This study considers 4 distinct cases of which 3 are singular (i.e. healthy baseline, bent shaft and shaft rub) and a combined bent-rub case. CCS data fusion was initially used to rationalize measured vibration data from all sensor locations, after which principal component analysis (PCA) and kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) are used to reduce output data dimensionality. Finally, the most representative features are then automatically classified using artificial neural network (ANN). The above steps are integrated to form a smart fault detection and diagnosis framework. Details of the approach and results obtained are described in the paper. © 2023 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85187379596
"Measurement Selection Method for Aero-engine Discrete Operating Conditions Gas Path Analysis With Aero-engine fault detection and isolation (FDI), engineers can ensure engine works in a healthy and reliable condition. Gas path analysis (GPA) is widely used to conduct FDI. It is a data-driven method for the state-of-health diagnosis of aero-engine. However, the number of available parameters in GPA is usually limited due to the unavailability of additional sensors in the aero-engine. Considering this limitation, discrete operating conditions gas path analysis (DOCGPA) is introduced. It makes the GPA with fewer measurements possible without compromising diagnostic accuracy. The effectiveness of the DOCGPA is greatly influenced by the selection of measurements and operating points. However, no existing work investigates the systematic and quantitative way for measurement and operating points selection. Therefore, we propose a framework based on correlation analysis and a two-stage genetic algorithm to the help us select measurements and operating points. The correlation analysis identifies the similar faults from influence coefficients matrix and narrows down the range of meaningful measurements. A low-resolution genetic algorithm is carried out to find the combinations of measurements and operating points of relatively low predicted residual error sum of squares. Lastly, high-solution genetic algorithm combined with regularized least squares (RLS) is employed to refine the selection by searching the neighborhood of the previous results.

"Predictive Analytics in IoT and CPS: Enhancing Industrial Machinery Reliability through Sensor Data-Driven Remaining Useful Life Estimation The rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) has brought about a new era of connectivity, building intelligence into the very structure of our society. There are both challenges and possibilities that come with this change, especially when it comes to maintaining industrial machinery. When it comes to big, important machines like electrical transformers, predictive maintenance is very important because the costs of unplanned downtimes can be too high to bear. This essay looks at how the IoT can be used to actively keep an eye on these tools, with a focus on how sensor data can be collected and used to keep operations running smoothly. We look at how machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) can be used to look at this data and guess how much useful life a piece of machinery still has. This lets the machine be shut down for repair and keeps it from breaking down without warning. Even though these technologies have clear benefits, there isn't much written about how to combine them into a unified business process for predictive analytics. This study fills in the blanks by proposing a business process made just for analyzing sensor data and predicting Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of industrial machinery. To facilitate testing of the proposed business process, we provide a prototype implementation and discuss its details. We also present a way to evaluate this business process by applying the prototype implementation to a real-world dataset.

"Remaining Useful Life prediction of the rolling bearing based on CEEMDAN and regularized particle filter The precise prediction of the remaining useful life (RUL) of the rolling bearing is critical for arranging maintenance, improving the safety and reliability of machines. Among them, the construction of appropriate health index has a significant impact on the reliability of prediction. Based on complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) and regularized particle filter (RPF), a method for predicting the RUL of the rolling bearing is suggested to tackle this problem. In the suggested method, the vibration signal collected by the sensor is decomposed based on CEEMDAN. Then the kurtosis-correlation coefficient criterion is established to screen qualified IMF components to reconstruct the signal, and the denoising effect is realized. Secondly, the relative root mean square (RRMS) of the reconstructed signal is calculated to construct a health index CEEMDAN-RRMS. Then, the regularized particle filter (RPF) is achieved to predict the future degradation trend of CEEMDAN-RRMS.

"A Smart Particle Filter Technology for Battery State Estimation and Life Prediction Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are commonly employed in a wide range of industrial and household applications. However, the performance of Li-ion batteries degrades over time due to the aging process, which is difficult to measure using general sensors.

"Research on Electromagnetic Wave Propagation Characteristics in GIS Based on UHF Method Gas insulated enclosed combined appliances (GIS) are widely used in power systems by virtue of their small footprint and high insulation current carrying capacity. Partial discharge is an important basis for measuring the insulation characteristics of GIS. Among them, the UHF detection method has been widely concerned with the advantages of strong anti-interference ability, high detection sensitivity and fault location. This paper investigates the propagation characteristics of electromagnetic wave signals in GIS using the time-domain finite difference method based on UHF local discharge detection test, and provides a theoretical basis for inline UHF sensor arrangement and data analysis. The GIS model is modelled using XFDTD software, excitation sources are set at the high-voltage and low-voltage ends of the GIS, and monitoring points are set at the bottom of the GIS to study the propagation characteristics of electromagnetic waves in the GIS by analysing the time-frequency domain waveforms. And the size of the GIS was adjusted to study the changes of the discharge peak during the propagation of the GIS under different sizes. The simulation results show that the electromagnetic wave signal propagation in the GIS shows obvious time delay characteristics and amplitude decay characteristics, the low frequency component amplitude in the 0 ~ 0.6 GHz overall rising trend, while the high frequency component amplitude does not depend on the location of the occurrence of defects, high frequency component amplitude will be decayed with the increase of distance. Size changes have a large effect on the peak discharge value, with the peak discharge value decreasing with increasing outer conductor size and increasing with increasing inner conductor size.

"A Semi-Supervised Bayesian Anomaly Detection Technique for Diagnosing Faults in Industrial IoT Systems The Industry 4.0 paradigm has changed the way industrial systems with hundreds of sensor-actuator enabled devices, including industrial internet of things (IIoT), cooperate and communicate with the physical and human worlds. Given the intricacy, the diagnostics of such systems is extremely important. While anomaly detection is a valid approach to avoid unplanned maintenance or even complete breakdown, its effective realization in IIoT requires the design and implementation of frameworks for efficient monitoring, data collection, and analysis.

"An Improved Similarity-based Prognostics Method for Remaining Useful Life Estimation of Aero-Engine Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation is the most common task in the research field of prognostics and health management (PHM). Accurate RUL estimation can avoid accidents, maximize equipment utilization, and minimize maintenance costs. RUL estimation based on performance degradation data is a hot spot in current research. The data-driven method can find out the relationship between the sensor data and the system degradation level with run-to-failure data and do not require any domain knowledge. RUL estimation can be carried out even when it is difficult to obtain the mathematical model of system degradation process. Sensors are used to collect data and monitor performance index. The actual system will experience multiple working conditions from the initial state to the performance failure process, and different working conditions have different impact on system degradation. In order to solve the problem that the degradation trend of sensor data is not declining obviously and the prediction of residual life is not accurate, a similar residual remaining useful life prediction method based on operating conditions clustering analysis and information fusion is proposed. Similarity-based methods are suitable for RUL estimation when complex systems cannot use data learning to build a global model. The core idea of RUL estimation based on similarity method is that if the test samples have similar degradation performance as the reference samples, then they may have similar RUL. In this paper, considering the influence of system operating conditions and sensor sensitivity on aero-engine life prediction, a remaining life estimation method based on multi-information fusion residual similarity model is proposed. Firstly, different working conditions were analyzed by clustering, and the data of various sensors were normalized. Then, the data of multiple sensors with different sensitivity were fused into a health index related to system degradation by the information fusion method. The distance between the degradation curve of the test sample and the degradation trajectory of the similar model was taken as the scoring basis, and the closest degradation curves were selected according to the scoring level. Finally, the closest similar degradation curves were selected according to the scores, and the Remaining Useful Life was predicted based on the residual life of these curves. The validity of the proposed method is verified by the failure data test of aero turbofan engine. The experimental results show that the proposed method has high accuracy and versatility when a large number of historical data are available. By comparing the estimated life of different breakpoints, it is found that the Remaining Useful Life estimation becomes more accurate with the increase of the proportion of verified data. Compared with other related methods, this method has achieved better results in predicting accuracy.  © 2021 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85123587470
"A Novel Real-Time Framework for Embedded Systems Health Monitoring This paper proposes a real-time framework, used as a multi-step ahead forecasting system that can be used for prognostics and health management (PHM), aiming to address a number of industrial-scaled embedded systems where failures can lead to catastrophic events. A novel framework is presented, which combines strong offline training using machine learning techniques with online multi-step forecasting for realtime condition monitoring and prognostics. The offline training is performed with the objective to derive a model capable of predicting the system of interest within fixed performance criteria, which are the metrics that provided the best accuracy and the estimated prediction time to anticipate the performance in real-time. The online inference, on the other hand, uses techniques of multi-step forecasting to provide an advisory window for the operator in case one or multiple faults lead the system for a non-operational state or a hazardous situation. This paper propositions are tested and validated on a real system dataset, where frequent faults were detected during a certain period of time. Dimensionality reduction techniques were initially used on the dataset, ensuring that the overall model accuracy was not impaired, then an optimized bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) model was chosen due to its inherent capacity to solve the issue of vanishing gradients for time-dependent and sequential data series. The optimized model is then flashed on two target microcontrollers, which continuously refresh data received from the sensors and actuators in the field.

"VEMUT-Sub-Sampling: A Novel Method for Sparse Multivariate Time-Series Vehicle Data In today's automotive industry, modern vehicles are equipped with numerous sensors to monitor the vehicle's state. Accurate prediction of component wear-and-tear requires the identification and alignment of the appropriate sensors. However, this task is complicated by the sheer number of sensor features, their intermittent logging activity, and non-uniform data. Furthermore, the number of vehicles deemed suitable for analysis is exceedingly limited. In this paper, we address the prevalent challenge of sparse, irregular, and multivariate time series data encountered in various domains, with a particular focus on the automotive industry. Conventional methods like imputation or interpolation, which attempt to estimate data points, are inapplicable when the dataset is limited in size, consists of highly irregular time spans, a large feature space, and data sparsity. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel subsampling methodology for VEhicle MUltivariate Irregular Time series data (VEMUT). Utilizing VEMUT, multiple sub-samples generate an increased dataset size, allowing machine learning models to learn high-performing and generalizable models, even when the dataset is limited in size. We examine the performance of the resulting dataset from VEMUT's sub-sampling across three simple network architectures: a fully convolutional network, a fully convolutional network with attention, and a convolutional network with pooling. Our findings reveal over 99% accuracy for all architectures on the validation data, leading to a correct prediction of the wear-and-tear of a Porsche Taycan's air suspension module. These results highlight the potential of our approach to significantly enhance models capable of recognizing patterns in data and predicting future developments.

Image sensors' reliability attract many researchers' interests as many image sensors are used in autonomous vehicles. We propose an online image sensor fault detection method based on comparing the historical variances of normal pixels and defective pixels to detect faults. For fault pixels without uncertainty, with a detecting window of more than 30 frames, we get 100% accuracy and 100% recall on realistic continuous traffic pictures from the KITTI data set.

This paper addresses a delay measurement scheme based on logic BIST and gives experiment results to observe aging phenomenon of test chips under accelerated life test. The measurement scheme consists of scan-based logic BIST, a variable test clock generator, and digital temperature and voltage sensors. The sensors are used to compensate measured delay values for temperature and voltage variations in field. Evaluation using SPICE simulation shows that the scheme can measure a circuit delay with resolution of 92 ps. The delay measurement scheme is also implemented on fabricated test chips with 180 nm CMOS technology and accelerated test is performed using ATE and burn-in equipment. Experimental results show that a circuit delay increased 552 ps when accelerated the chip for 3000 hours. It is confirmed that the on-chip delay measurement scheme has enough accuracy for detection of aging-induced delay increase.  © 2020 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85091583604
"Periodicity detection algorithm and applications on IoT data Data collected by sensors has hidden value that can be used to infer valuable knowledge about the system, such as identifying faults in transmission or functioning faults in various system components. Solutions for exploring and exploiting data need to be developed to extract such knowledge.

"Digital Twin for Predicting Progressive Damage in Operating Pressure Vessels According to the definition of the French Alliance ""Industry of the Future"", the digital twin is a virtual clone of a physical system or a process. It systematically implies the existence of a ""digital model""coupled with the object it copies. Depending on the system concerned and the desired usage, it can be a geometric, multiphysical, functional, behavioral, and decision-making model. It must evolve over time like its real twin. It can be used to improve the control, security and optimization of production lines and factories, digital continuity at the product level, from its design to its end of life, monitoring and predictive maintenance. The digital twin appears as a reliable way to monitor operation, to evaluate the resistance and safety of pressure vessels (PVs) in real service conditions. Via the connected transducers (IoT), we can integration the life cycle information in an automatic data processing module, and finally to capitalize on all this data to optimize the design of new products. To this end, the first objective of the thesis is to contribute to the development of a methodology for real-time assessment of the integrity of pressure vessels, by implementing a predictive maintenance strategy in place of the classical and costly, preventive or curative maintenance, based on IoT and digital twin technologies.

"Fused Deposition Modeling 3D Printing Fault Diagnosis using Temporal Convolutional Network Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is used in quick prototyping and industrial manufacturing in many emerging industries. However, the process is imperfect, and printing failures often occur, thus leading to wasted time and resources. To address these issues of FDM-type 3D printers, developing a smart monitoring device designed to predict abnormal activities during the printing process accurately is proposed. In the proposed method, a set of collaborative sensors accumulates time-series data for forecasting. The proposed method uses Multi-Head Encoder-Decoder Temporal Convolutional Network (MH-ED-TCN) to extract data features and interpret the relationship between sensor readings occurring during the printing process to identify factors contributing to printing errors. Compared with other known models such as LSTM, SVM, and CNN, the proposed MH-ED-TCN model performs better in error detection.

"An Intelligent Compound Fault Diagnosis Method Using Convolutional Neural Network for Harmonic Drive As the key component of industrial robot, harmonic drive is unfortunately also the weakest part of the robot. Therefore, fault diagnosis is needed to find out what causes the problems and hence, find the remedies. Most of the existing mature machine learning approaches can obtain ideal results in the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. However, the shortcoming of these methods is that the classifier only can output one label when the test sample is a composite fault signal, rather than multiple labels. Consequently, these traditional methods cannot simultaneously identify and output every label in the composite fault signal. To solve this problem, an intelligent method named Multi-Sensors Convolutional Neural Networks with Sigmoid function Classifier (MSCNN-SC) is proposed for compound fault identification. CNN is adopted to effectively obtain the representative features of the original signals. Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) Loss and Sigmoid functions are then employed to calculate and output the probability of each label. The decision strategies using adjusted thresholds are designed to obtain the decoupling results of compound fault diagnosis. The proposed approach is validated by the multi-axises harmonic drives of the industrial robot. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can correctly identify the compound fault. © 2021 IEEE",2-s2.0-85128096142
"Comparison of Incremental Encoders in Order to Improve IAS Based Diagnosis All PHM strategies are based on scalar or vectoral indicators that translate more or less synthetically the statistical properties of the measurements made on the machine to be monitored. The physical signals measured can be of various kinds. In the particular case of rotating machines, vibration monitoring based on accelerometer readings undeniably dominates the market. However, other physical measurements may reveal faulty behavior. This paper is interested in obtaining monitoring indicators based on the measurement of the instantaneous speed of a machine.

"Advanced Kalman Filter for Current Estimation in AC Microgrids The stability and monitoring of AC microgrids (AC MG) are greatly influenced by gathering sufficient and precise information. Since installing several sensors on AC MGs is costly and increases AC MG ripple, integrating a minimum number of cost-effective sensors is preferred.

"UHF Sensors for On-line Partial Discharge Detection on Power Transformer: Hilbert fractal, Moore Fractal and Peano fractal Partial discharge (PD) is the causes of the fault to occur in high voltage equipment due to the breakdown of the insulation system happen on equipment, even old equipment or new equipment. The PD in transformer oil is one of the significant causes of insulation failure and a breakdown. Hence, a sensor is needed to continuously monitor and detect the PD at an early stage on the power transformer. An antenna is one of the sensors that can be used to detect PD based on ultra-high frequency (UHF) method. However, the size of the antenna is the main problem to be installed in the transformer tank.

"IFIZZ: Deep-State and Efficient Fault-Scenario Generation to Test IoT Firmware IoT devices are abnormally prone to diverse errors due to harsh environments and limited computational capabilities. As a result, correct error handling is critical in IoT. Implementing correct error handling is non-trivial, thus requiring extensive testing such as fuzzing. However, existing fuzzing cannot effectively test IoT error-handling code. First, errors typically represent corner cases, thus are hard to trigger. Second, testing error-handling code would frequently crash the execution, which prevents fuzzing from testing following deep error paths.In this paper, we propose IFIZZ, a new bug detection system specifically designed for testing error-handling code in Linux-based IoT firmware. IFIZZ first employs an automated binary-based approach to identify realistic runtime errors by analyzing errors and error conditions in closed-source IoT firmware. Then, IFIZZ employs state-aware and bounded error generation to reach deep error paths effectively. We implement and evaluate IFIZZ on 10 popular IoT firmware. The results show that IFIZZ can find many bugs hidden in deep error paths. Specifically, IFIZZ finds 109 critical bugs, 63 of which are even in widely used IoT libraries. IFIZZ also features high code coverage and efficiency, and covers 67.3% more error paths than normal execution. Meanwhile, the depth of error handling covered by IFIZZ is 7.3 times deeper than that covered by the state-of-the-art method.

"IoT and Digital Twin: A new perspective for Cultural Heritage predictive maintenance In the construction sector, the maintenance and monitoring of buildings are of fundamental importance, both in civil and cultural heritage buildings, ensuring their preservation, safety, and proper functioning over time. The preservation of the built heritage is one of the main objectives that a nation must pursue, and thanks to the ever-increasing spread of new technologies, it is possible to apply innovative approaches capable of monitoring in real-time the progressive damage of structures or intercepting sudden situations capable of causing extensive damage. Traditional monitoring methodologies, employed so far, are based on direct inspections and manual data collection, and are often expensive and only sometimes effective. In this scenario, a significant contribution has been made by the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, which has made it possible to collect real-time data from sensors placed on the structures to be monitored, thus enabling the implementation of predictive maintenance methodologies. A further contribution to the development of these methodologies has come from the emergence of the concept of the Digital Twin (DT), a digital model of an intended or actual real-world product, system or physical process that serves as an effectively indistinguishable digital counterpart of it for practical purposes such as simulation, integration, testing, monitoring and maintenance. In order to make the DT even more effective, it is possible to link it to the real structure through BIM, i.e. a process applied to existing buildings or monuments that aims not only at the mere restitution of the three-dimensional model but above all at the creation of so-called 'intelligent models'. The latter is rich in geometric information, including the state of conservation of materials, in which all components are parametric objects with well-defined semantics and can contain all the historical information derived from an adequate documentary analysis.

"A transfer learning based method for incipient fault detection The intelligent incipient fault detection of machines has two requirements. 1) Labeled monitoring data with incipient fault clues are obtainable. 2) The training data and test data are samples of variables with independent and identical distribution (i.i.d). However, the collection of sufficient labeled data is difficult since sensors are not easy to install on some machines.

"Path Delay Measurement with Correction for Temperature and Voltage Variations Path delay measurement in field is useful for not only detection of delay-related faults but also prediction of aging-induced delay faults. In order to utilize the delay measurement results for fault detection and fault prediction, the measured delay must be corrected because the circuit delay is varied in field due to environment such as temperature or voltage variations. This paper proposes a method of BIST-based path delay measurement in which the influence of environmental variations is eliminated. An on-chip sensor measures temperature and voltage during delay measurement. Using information from the temperature and voltage sensor and pre-computed temperature and voltage sensitivities of the circuit delay, the measured delay value is corrected to a delay value that would be obtained under a fixed temperature and voltage. Evaluation for a test chip with 65nm CMOS technology implementing the proposed method shows that errors of measured delays brought by environmental variations could be reduced from 2419 to 211 ps in the range of 30 to 80 °C and 1.05 to 1.35 V.

"Design of improved fault-tolerant filtering algorithm based on multi-source information fusion The federal filtering fault detection method generally used the chi-square detection. Although the state chi- square detection has high detection accuracy, two state estimates need a large calculation.

"Fault diagnosis method based on recursive federated transfer learning under multi rate sampling The number of samples and the use of sample information affect the accuracy of fault diagnosis model based on deep learning. In the actual industrial equipment health monitoring, there are often multi rate sampling sensors, which makes the number of samples with complete structure based on deep learning training very few.

At a single time, the local model recursively federates according to the variable relationship between institutions. The federal central model is jointly optimized with the local models of each institution to obtain a global fault diagnosis model with high accuracy at that time, then the multiple time models are recursively federated according to the previous sample time and the next sample time to obtain a more optimized fault diagnosis model.

"A Combination of Fourier Transform and Machine Learning for Fault Detection and Diagnosis of Induction Motors Induction motors are widely used in different indus-try areas and can experience various kinds of faults in stators and rotors. In general, fault detection and diagnosis techniques for induction motors can be supervised by measuring quantities such as noise, vibration, and temperature. The installation of mechanical sensors in order to assess the health conditions of a machine is typically only done for expensive or load-critical machines, where the high cost of a continuous monitoring system can be justified. Nevertheless, induced current monitoring can be implemented inexpensively on machines with arbitrary sizes by using current transformers. In this regard, effective and low-cost fault detection techniques can be implemented, hence reducing the maintenance and downtime costs of motors. In this work, machine learning techniques have been combined with traditional Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to proposes a simple but yet efficient method for fault detection and diagnosis of induction motors. Raw signals are converted from time domain to frequency domain using FFT. The FFT spectrum are then divided into frequency segments and energy coefficients of each segment are calculated as the sum over the FFT amplitudes. These energy coefficients are used as features for machine learning in our platform. The proposed method is validated on real-world data and achieves a precision of 99.7% for fault detection and 100% for fault classification with minimal expert knowledge requirement. In addition, this approach allows users to be able to optimize/balance risks and maintenance costs to achieve the highest benefit based on their requirements. These are the key requirements of a robust prognostics and health management system. © 2021 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85123463285
"Monitoring and diagnosis of multistage manufacturing processes using hierarchical Bayesian networks In recent years, manufacturing systems have given rise to manufacturing big data due to the rapid developments in sensor and information technology and that has fueled data-driven research techniques towards addressing the issues in multistage quality control and diagnosis. In this paper, a unified framework with dual Hierarchical Bayesian Networks (HBNs) has been presented for simultaneous online process monitoring and fault diagnosis of a multistage manufacturing system. To achieve this, a novel AMDS (Absolute Mean Deviation of States) control chart has been developed for monitoring the unobserved inputs. The AMDS control chart is built on the AMDS statistic, which is calculated using the inferred states distribution generated utilizing the HBNs of the unobserved inputs. Discrete event simulation results of the two-stage process demonstrate that the methodology can successfully detect process changes and diagnose the root causes of the change. In addition, it can also identify the time at which the fault has occurred and the type (mean shift or variance change) and nature (step faults or slow drifts) of the change. The robustness of the proposed methodology is extensively tested against multiple randomly generated non-linear quadratic process models for two-stage systems. © 2021 The Authors.

"Machine Condition Monitoring System Based on IoT Platform for Intelligent Maintenance The Internet of Things (IoT) in an industrial automation system is a new strategy for keeping machines operational during production. Conventional approaches to machinery condition monitoring are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and disrupt production processes that will affect productivity. It is very important to have an IoT solution set up for remote machine monitoring. Productivity can be achieved by continuous monitoring of machine performance in real time. For condition monitoring, real-time machine data were gathered from the many external sensors and PLC systems networked to the gateway through the data acquisition board. The control panel of the IoT system was connected to the different devices. An IoT platform created by Python was evaluated and made sense of the acquired data. Linear Regression was used as an algorithm to detect the machine abnormality in normal operating conditions. The implemented algorithm for predicting machine failure extends the machine's remaining usable life, enhances safety, minimizes production time lost to maintenance, and lowers the cost of auxiliary components and items. Real-time data visualization inspired the development of an augmented reality virtual environment based on picture targets that allow the manufacturer to track the system's health and locate malfunctioning components.

"A multisensor induction motors diagnostics method for bearing cyclic fault This paper presents a multi-sensor approach for the bearings diagnostics of induction motors. The physical quantities taken into account are vibrations (acceleration signals), stator current, axial and radial external leakage fluxes. The fault to detect is a 'cyclic' localized crack on the external ring of the drive-end bearing. At first, piezoelectric and MEMS accelerometers are compared, showing that a cheap sensor could give sufficient diagnostic information. Subsequently, the analysis of the electromagnetic signals' spectra is used to detect the fault. In order to facilitate this analysis, the exact characteristic fault frequency is obtained from the vibration spectra and identified in the current and flux signatures. This method avoids the slippage uncertainty on the electromagnetic spectra's fault peaks detection. Further tests with oscillation load torque show new signatures in the spectra and tests with inverter highlight the peculiar issues coming from this supply condition. © 2020 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85098640318

"Anomaly Detection of Marine Gas Turbines based on WDCA-ARX Model The adverse working environment such as marine salt spray, high temperature, high pressure, and high speed makes the gas turbine prone to various failures. Gas turbine health management and fault diagnosis are becoming increasingly important to their safety and reliability. It is possible for various ambient conditions and sensor noises to seriously interfere with fault information. In addition, the dynamic process of a gas turbine is difficult to model due to incomplete design information. Anomaly detection of gas turbines is complicated by these issues.

"A data-driven approach for linking models of large-scale bridges and monitoring data Predictive maintenance of large-scale structures such as bridges requires precise numerical models to describe their current condition. Typically, solving an inverse problem is necessary to determine model parameters from Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) data. However, conventional methods such as Finite Element Updating through optimization algorithms demand substantial computational resources, as numerous parameter combinations need to be assessed to identify the optimal model state in each calibration step. Consequently, these methods are only partially suitable for creating digital twins of bridges. This paper introduces an alternative approach by treating the inverse problem as a model parameter classification problem. This involves establishing a model database that covers a wide range of damage states. Notably, this method eliminates the need for multiple simulations during the application phase, as simulations are performed only once in an offline context. Subsequently, a classification algorithm is trained based on this database, enabling real-time selection of the best-fit model for practical applications using SHM data, without the necessity for additional simulations. Transparency in algorithm decisions is crucial for infrastructure maintenance, therefore, optimal classification trees from the field of interpretable machine learning are employed. Decision trees offer a balance between high accuracy and interpretability while providing additional advantages, such as sensor placement evaluation. In summary, this approach demonstrates the potential for linking numerical models with SHM data through the application of interpretable machine learning techniques, facilitating real-time decision-making for the preservation and management of critical infrastructure. © 2024 Elsevier B.V..

"The Paradox of Electromagnetic Interference Affecting Medical Devices at International Hospitals Overburdened electric cables, transformers, and other electrical equipment can fail. Given the historical uncertainty of their backup measures, hospitals are looking to innovative possibilities for power outage mitigation. For example, prior to failure, aberrant thermal readings, noise, and spark emissions may be detected (in addition to aberrant current and voltage waveforms). The equipment at key poles servicing the hospital can be monitored for aberrations; likewise, the power systems within the hospital can also be monitored for aberrations. In this way, service personnel may be dispatched prior to terminal failure. This hyper-locale power aberration assessment mechanism enables predictive/preventive (leveraging early indicators and warnings of potential power reliability and stability issues) maintenance rather than simply corrective maintenance (allowing the system to operate until the equipment fails).

However, this method requires high accuracy of Remaining Useful Life estimation. Estimating Remaining Useful Life can be very difficult especially when the amount of data sensor is too large. A machine learning approach could be useful in order to understand all the hidden correlations between the sensor measurements, allowing an accurate RUL prediction. Conventional machine learning such as Auto Regressive Moving Average and RNN conventional failed to predict the accurate prediction because produce high mean absolute percentage error. Long-Short Term Memory network is a best machine learning method that needed to predict the condition of the equipment because it has the ability to store memories for a long time simultaneously and can understand complex correlations between data thus providing information that is very useful in determining Remaining Useful Life. This study uses the Long-Short Term Memory method to predict circulating water pump bearing condition from vibration signal. The modelling results show accurate signal predictions. It can be seen from the estimated value of the resulting Long-Short Term Memory model equal to the actual signal value. The accuracy of the results of the Long-Short Term Memory modeling is also supported from the results of research conducted by previous authors, where modeling using the Long-Short Term Memory method produces the smallest mean absolute percentage error of the two other conventional algorithm methods (Auto Regressive Moving Average and plain Recurrent Neural Network) which is 3.8%. The accuracy of the Long-Short Term Memory model shows the reliability of the architecture so that the plant gets a warning before damage occurs.  © 2020 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85097945835

"Intelligent Fault Diagnosis of Delta 3D Printers Using Local Support Vector Machine by a Cheap Attitude Multi-sensor Identifying the most effective features and improving the accuracy of health status identification have an important impact on the printing reliability of 3D printers. In this paper, local support vector machine (LSVM) is used as an attitude monitoring method for condition recognition of delta 3D printers.

"A data-driven approach for approximating non-linear dynamic systems using LSTM networks The analysis of sensor data in nonlinear dynamical systems plays a fundamental role in a variety of modern engineering problems like Fatigue Analysis and Predictive Maintenance. In many applications, the accurate approximation of sensor signals supports and complements experimental efforts in order to accelerate the development process and conserve resources. Virtual sensing techniques aim to replace physical sensors in a system by using the data from available sensors to estimate additional unknown quantities of interest. Forward prediction estimates the system response for a given drive signal during the commission of component test rigs. Data-driven approaches can be convenient tools for forward prediction and virtual sensing, as they only require a sufficiently large dataset of the desired input and output quantities for the purpose of model parametrization. The presented approach explores two hybrid modeling strategies, which combine Frequency Response Function models with Long Short-Term Memory networks to approximate the behavior of non-linear dynamic systems with multiple input and output channels. The proposed method utilizes short subsequences of signals to carry out model training and prediction. Long sequence estimations are generated by combining the individual subsequence predictions using a windowing technique. Our approach is tested on a large, non-linear experimental dataset, obtained from a servo hydraulic fatigue test bench.

"Dynamic probabilistic model checking for sensor validation in industry 4.0 applications Industry 4.0 adopts Internet of Things (IoT) and service-oriented architectures to integrate Cyber-Physical Systems and Enterprise Planning into manufacturing operations. This kind of integration consists of a combination of connected sensors and run-Time control algorithms. Consequential control decisions are driven by sensor-generated data. Hence, the trustworthiness of the sensor network readings is increasingly crucial to guarantee the performance and the quality of a manufacturing task.

"Leveraging CMOS Aging for Efficient Microelectronics Design Aging is known to impact electronic systems affecting performance and reliability. However, it has been shown that it also brings benefits for power saving and area optimization. This paper presents highlights of those benefits and further shows how aging effects can be leveraged by novel methods to contribute towards improving hardware oriented security and reliability of electronic circuits. We have demonstrated static power reduction in complex circuits from IWLS05 benchmark suite, reaching a noticeable 7S% of reduction in ten years of operation. In hardware oriented security, a novel aging sensor has been proposed for detection of recycled ICs, measuring discharge time Tdv of the virtual power (VV dd) network in power-gated designs. This sensor utilizes discharge time of VVdd network through leakage current that is much more sensitive to aging than path delay, exhibiting up to 15.7X increment in 10 years. Furthermore, we show how frequency degradation caused by aging is used for online prediction of remaining useful lifetime (RUL) of electronic circuits. Results show an average RUL prediction deviation of less than 0.1 years. This methodology provides node calculations rather than a mean time to failure (MTTF) of the population.

"Fast Machine Fault Diagnosis Using Marginalized Denoising Autoencoders Based on Acoustic Signal Recently, an increasing popularity of data-driven deep learning research in the field of machine fault diagnosis has been observed. Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDA), as a classic type of deep learning method, has been successfully used to learn effective representations for machine fault diagnosis. However, those previous studies always encounter with the inherent limitations of SDA: high computational cost, time-consuming training, and lack of scalability to high-dimensional data. Unfortunately, those limitations can restrict the applicability of those studies in real-world applications, which require timely model upgrade and fast real-time diagnosis. Besides, most previous studies concentrate on the vibration signal, and thus lack the attention towards other kinds of sensor data like acoustical signal. Therefore, to address the two problems above, inspired by the marginalized Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (mSDA), we adopt a variant of SDA for fast fault diagnosis on sound signal. In this way, the required stochastic gradient descent based on back propagation in traditional deep learning methods is replaced by a forward closed-form solution. Opposite to the time-consuming works which demand training thousands of parameters during optimization, this deep architecture only needs to determine a few hyper parameters in advance. To verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposal on sound signal, extensive empirical evaluation on a publicly available sound signal dataset of gear fault is carried on. Thorough comparisons with some state-of-the-art faulty diagnosis approaches, confirm the superiority of the proposal in high diagnostic accuracy and lower computational cost. © 2020 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85087282548
"The Role of Machine Learning in Revolutionizing Business Automation and Efficiency In the rapidly evolving digital era, machine learning has emerged as one of the game-changers in disruptive business automation and operational performance. Business operations are witnessing a seismic shift courtesy of ML; systems today can learn from data, track patterns, and make informed decisions with little human intervention. Machine learning is a foundational pillar in business line automation and many organisations follow it for efficiency and continuance. Using machine learning, organizations automate repetitive time-consuming tasks that earlier needed manual intervention thus reducing thier operational cost and minimizing the chances of human errors. From customer service chatbots to intelligent virtual assistants and robotic processing automation powered by ML algorithms - businesses are doing it all to provide faster, more reliable and personalized services. ML models are used in all, including finance, healthcare, logistics, and retail, which can analyze immense volumes of both structured and unstructured data, enabling predictive analytics, anomaly detection, and real-time decision-making. Machine Learning also builds intelligent systems which evolves and adapts with time. Machine Learning is often employed in customer relationship management to help parse through user behavior, purchase history, and engagement patterns to come up with tailored recommendations of products and services to users, which helps improve user experience and customer retention. No one is going to adopt predictive models in a supply chain without measuring the impact, it needs to forecast demand and predict better stock levels or better logistics for dynamic response to demand.

"Manini Connect: IoT for integrated building monitoring Constructions are conceived today following multi-risk scenarios encompassing natural and anthropic hazards, in the context of a rapid climate change. Nevertheless, currently the monitoring of local demand and/or performance on specific buildings is very poor due to the absence of a praxis towards the installation and the management of sensors, dedicated to the performance of the whole building. This makes the post-event field surveys and damage mapping extremely difficult, and retrofit intervention timespans very long, with negative reflection over the resilience of the whole built heritage. Manini Connect is an innovative patented system providing a response to this issue through integrated monitoring of precast structures. Through a set of interconnected sensors, the system monitors the static and dynamic behavior of the structures during critical events (earthquakes, strong winds, heavy rainfalls, collisions, blasts, etc.) and thermo-hygrometric parameters inside/outside the building. Moreover, it can be coupled with sensors devoted to the monitoring of the air quality inside the building, the local production of energy from renewable sources, and the consumptions in terms of electricity, water, gas, waste, etc. Taking advantage of the production of precast structures in offsite permanent plants, some sensors and utilities are easily inserted in the columns and cast within them during the production phase, whilst other typologies are collected into an external box installed on the roof throughout the building construction process. The data are received in real-time by the dedicated internal control center of Manini Prefabbricati SpA, and, after the occurrence of an exceptional event is revealed by the overcoming of predetermined thresholds of demand parameters, the system sends alerts for check. The user has himself constant access to the data through a dedicated platform accessible from PC and other devices. This allows to set predictive retrofit/maintenance works in response to anomalies or damages detected by the system, as a function of the parameters archived from the structural design of each specific building. © 2024 The Authors.

"Data-Driven Cross-Layer Fault Management Architecture for Sensor Networks The paper proposes a data-driven cross-layer resilient architecture for sensor networks. The novelty of the approach lies in combining fault detection across data and network layers into a coordinated system health management architecture.

Thus, there is no need for additional hardware resources. The data layers considered include the raw sensor data layer, the processed data layer and the data aggregation layer. The proposed cross-layer fault management architecture utilizes a hierarchical health-map structure for fault detection and data aggregation. A practical case study of an underwater sensor network for harbor water flow monitoring application based on the proposed architecture is presented. Synthetic experiments with real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in fault detection and diagnosis.

"An Agnostic Data-Driven Approach to Predict Stoppages of Industrial Packing Machine in near As data awareness in manufacturing companies increases with the deployment of sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, data-driven maintenance and prediction have become quite popular in the Industry 4.0 paradigm. Machine Learning (ML) has been recognised as a promising, efficient and reliable tool for fault detection use cases, as it allows to export important knowledge from monitored assets. Scientists deal with issues such as the small amount of data that indicate potential problems, or the imbalance which exists between the standard process data and the data inadequacy of the systems to make a high precision forecast. Currently, in this context, even large industries are not able to effectively predict abnormal behaviors in their tools, processes and equipment, when adopting strategies to anticipate crucial events. In this paper, we propose a methodology to enable prediction of a packing machine's stoppages in manufacturing process of a large industry, by using forecasting techniques based on univariate time series data. There are more than 100 reasons that cause the machine to stop, in a quite big production line length. However, we use a single signal, concerning the machines operational status to make our prediction, without considering other fault or warning signals, hence its characterization as ""agnostic"".

Using UHF partial discharge detection method to find and diagnose internal insulation defects in time is an important means during the operation and maintenance of GIS equipment. Different discharge types in GIS show different partial discharge characteristics. This paper proposes a diagnosis and positioning method of discharge faults in GIS equipment through experiments. Firstly, UHF partial discharge signals of different typical discharge models in GIS are obtained by UHF sensor, and then 3D GIS PRPS patterns are drawn.

This study describes a drone-based system for damage detection that works based on high-resolution imaging, thermal sensors, and metrics for structural integrity to identify and classify damage to infrastructure. The system is in a position to produce records that show temperature anomalies, values of structural integrity, and classifications of severity of damage after simulating data collection from drones. Severity of damage is dependent upon a rule-based analysis in which assessments on the basis of temperature anomalies as well as structural integrity are taken into consideration in declaring damage as 'No Damage,' 'Minor Damage,' 'Moderate Damage,' 'Severe Damage,' or 'Critical Damage.' An AI model would further classify and predict damage severity on the basis of a calculated severity score through an efficient rule-based manner for automated damage detection. Visualization techniques such as bar graphs are used to display the results and provide a clear distribution of damages across the infrastructure. The results indicate that when used in combination with AI algorithms, such a system would increase efficiency in damage detection and accuracy of results, at a lower cost and less human error.

Correct and Control Complex IoT Systems: Evaluation of a Classification for System Anomalies In practice there are deficiencies in precise interteam communications about system anomalies to perform troubleshooting and postmortem analysis along different teams operating complex IoT systems. We evaluate the quality in use of an adaptation of IEEE Std. 1044-2009 with the objective to differentiate the handling of fault detection and fault reaction from handling of defect and its options for defect correction. We extended the scope of IEEE Std. 1044-2009 from anomalies related to software only to anomalies related to complex IoT systems. To evaluate the quality in use of our classification a study was conducted at Robert Bosch GmbH. We applied our adaptation to a postmortem analysis of an IoT solution and evaluated the quality in use by conducting interviews with three stakeholders. Our adaptation was effectively applied and interteam communications as well as iterative and inductive learning for product improvement were enhanced. © 2020 IEEE.,2-s2.0-85099274515
"Digital Twin for Predictive Maintenance of Palm Oil Processing Machines When industrial equipment in the palm oil processing process is damaged, the problem that often occurs is the forced downtime of the machine which results in the cessation of the palm oil processing process and increases the amount of machine maintenance costs. The turbine engine is one of the machines that often experience damage to the point where it has a big impact on the cessation of the palm oil processing process. The digital twin concept focuses on the characteristics of a turbine engine so that it can represent physical objects in digital form. Meanwhile, predictive maintenance focuses on parameters that affect turbine engine damage, as well as data obtained from sensors, such as temperature data, capacity, and normal engine time to critical engine time. The application of digital twins for predictive maintenance of turbine engines requires five stages, namely building digital twins, obtaining, and exploring data, preprocessing training data, develop predictive models, and deploy algorithms. This study describes the architectural design of the predictive maintenance model using the digital twin concept which is applied to the maintenance of turbine engines in the palm oil processing process. In future research, the predictive maintenance model using the digital twin concept is expected to be able to predict machine maintenance schedules to overcome the risk of forced downtime, increase the life of production machines and help estimate maintenance costs.  © 2022 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85150424268

"Enabling condition based maintenance in a precious metal processing plant In precious metal processing plants, suitable maintenance systems should be deployed to provide the necessary plant operating conditions, ensure plant availability and provide critical fume extraction and filtration systems for health and safety. A key focus for this work was use of sensors to monitor and predict abnormal equipment behaviour and examining how the data obtained could be processed into information and better inform the condition monitoring systems. The requirement for this research was driven by escalating maintenance costs in an industrial case study in South Africa. Historical records on equipment failure and was used in Pareto analysis to define the critical assets and failure modes for equipment that dominated the escalating maintenance costs for the industrial case study. Vibration data from mounted sensors was then collected the identified critical assets, analysed and used to infer condition of critical assets. Statistical tools based on process capability index values for processes in control and out of control were defined for tracking system deterioration and enabling predictive maintenance. The results show that sensors and thresholds based on process capability index can be used in predictive maintenance to alert maintenance teams to attend to vacuum pumps and fans pre-failure and hence improve plant availability and operation and reduces cost. © 2017 The Authors.

"An implementation framework for condition-based maintenance in a bearing ring grinder The demand on a bearing ring grinder, as any other machine tool, is to produce parts as per the specification and desired quality. A failure to achieve the quality can be due to functional issues or mechanical failure modes. Ultimately this results in lower productivity and higher production costs. Despite the increased emphasis on practicing condition-based machine maintenance (CBM) in manufacturing applications, it is still considered a challenge to fully deploy CBM in production machines due to diversity in equipment and variety in machine configurations as well as complex characteristics of failure modes. Although there exists extensive literature on CBM for machine tools and subsystems, the issue remains with realization of a technically capable and cost effective CBM system, specifically for a bearing ring grinder. Therefore, sensor(s) selection, data acquisition setup, data processing and analysis are the essential factors considered in the proposed framework to ensure a systematic and organized CBM implementation. The CBM setup is evaluated against production of bearing rings under different process and failure conditions. A machine type independent data acquisition system is designed to capture both machine and process dynamics. The data gathered from sensors at strategic locations exhibits its effectiveness in capturing the process and condition variations in relation to time and operating modes. The presented results of data analysis support the capability and effectiveness of the proposed framework. The utility of this framework can be extended for any number of scenarios including predictive maintenance or adaptive process optimization where solutions using machine learning and artificial intelligence tools can benefit from high dimensional structured dataset. The proposed framework provides a strong foundation to fast track the adaption of CBM in other production machines having similar subsystems. © 2022 The Authors.

"An IIoT approach for edge intelligence in production environments using machine learning and knowledge graphs The mining industries need novel solutions to reduce production stoppages. Predictive maintenance solutions and especially the hardware components, cannot operate properly under such harsh conditions, as high concentration of dust and other chemical material may lead into fault sensor measurements. This study presents a solution for condition monitoring and predictive maintenance and productions status monitoring for assets operating in harsh operating environments. First, an edge device is connected to multiple sensors monitoring critical parameters related to the operating conditions of an asset. In particular, the device is in charge of data collection, filtering and smart data generation for further analysis and processing. At a later stage, the collected data are pushed to a cloud platform where predictive analytics, as well as production status analytics, are estimated. The condition monitoring and predictive maintenance component utilizes machine learning in order to estimate the Remaining Useful Life of the monitored asset(s). The production status component utilizes knowledge graphs that are populated with data provided by the edge device. The combination of these two components aims to provide meaningful insight to field personnel supporting them in decision making and production supervision.

"Condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of a marine diesel engine with machine learning techniques A marine engine room is a complex system in which many different subsystems are interacting with each other. At the center of this system is the main diesel engine which produces the propulsion force. Many other components such as compressed air, cooling, heating, lubricating oil, fuel, and pumping systems act as auxiliary machines to the main engine. Automation of many functions in the engine room is starting to play an important role in new generation ships to provide better control using sensors monitoring the engine and its environment. Sensors exist in the current generation ships, but engineers evaluate the sensor data for the presence of any problems. Maintenance actions are taken based on these manual analyses or regular maintenance is carried out at times determined by manufacturers, whether such actions are needed or not. With machine learning, it is possible to develop an algorithm using past evaluations made by engineers. Recent studies show that highly accurate results can be obtained using machine learning methods when there is sufficient data. In this study, we develop new learning-based algorithms and evaluate them on data obtained from a realistic ship engine room simulator. Data for a predetermined set of parameters of a high-power diesel engine were collected and analyzed for their role in a set of fault situations. These fault conditions and the associated sensor data are used to train a set of classifiers achieving fault detection up to 99% accuracy.

"Predictive maintenance in pharmaceutical manufacturing lines using deep transformers Inherent complexities in pharmaceutical manufacturing lines of modern industrial facilities make precise and timely detection of malfunction occurrences necessary. In fact, unpredicted malfunctions in a production line can often provoke a cascade of adverse effects that can occur everywhere in the production chain bringing the manufacturing line to a halt for undefined time periods. Such events can have unfortunate consequences that are not always confined to the damaged part itself but propagate throughout the production line. Nevertheless, modern production lines are equipped with a multitude of data sensors that enable the real-time and fine-grained monitoring of each constituent part of the production process providing a richness of information that can be exploited by intelligent data processing methods. In this work, we present ManuTrans, a deep learning-based model for monitoring real-time raw sensor data, deriving the condition of a pharmaceutical manufacturing line and predicting the next moment in time when a malfunction can occur. The model is further able to predict the severity of the next malfunction and can contribute adjunct information in corporate decision-making. The suggested approach exploits the capacity of deep transformer models for extracting both long- and short-term correlations as well as patterns in sequential data and, combined with a linear output layer, conducts both classification and regression. The proposed approach was tested on a real dataset comprising raw data from two manufacturing lines, and it achieved promising results. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.",2-s2.0-85164526271

"Fault diagnosis of CNC machine-tools for drilling Titanium alloy The development of intelligent techniques based on real-time monitoring for machining applications is one of the challenges of Industry 4.0, as in the Aerospace Industry. Drilling is the most used process before the assembly of airplane sheets, that nowadays are composed of different layers of materials with different optimized cutting conditions. The fault diagnosis during drilling stack materials is important to reduce cost and improve the process quality. Using a machine-tool, it is important that the fault diagnoser does not use a large amount of memory and be capable of detecting faults in a fast manner. In this paper, we propose a timed automaton model representing the drilling process of a Titanium plate on a CNC machine, which is suitable for fault diagnosis without any additional sensors. The diagnoser uses only the spindle power and Z axis displacement read directly from the system controller. The target faults in this case are: (i) excessive tool-wear or tool breakage; (ii) the tool finds an off-centered hole while producing a blind-hole; (iii) the tool finds an under layer of a different material, as it occurs in a bi-layer material; and (iv) the plate thickness is below the desired one and a though hole is produced. The results show that the model is capable of identifying all faults and it could be used to alert a problem on the sequence of machining holes in the industry. © 2023 Elsevier B.V..

"Digital Twins for Predictive Maintenance Modern maintenance strategies tend to be a mixture of different approaches, dependent on the type of machine and the component failure mode. For some machines, time-based maintenance is appropriate, however not all failure is fully age-related and other situations may require risk-based or condition-based maintenance. Predictive maintenance is a method originating from condition-based maintenance and is primarily used to predict the remaining useful life of a machine. Predictive models can be data driven, experimental, physics based or a hybrid thereof. In this paper, a virtual factory is used together with a data/experimental driven hybrid approach through the use of statistical models encompassed in a digital twin to calculate the remaining useful life of machines in the factory. An augmented statistical model is chosen for this purpose as it relies on data being fed from the factory during operation, therefore suiting the twin's functionality. Sensor data from previous machines or failure profiles is pre-processed and machine learning is used to extract condition indicators. These indicators are used to identify different types of fault and predict degradation paths. Such a method requires no mechanistic understanding of the process and is thus generalizable. Furthermore, with the possibility of using synthetic data, the method requires limited historic data compared to other methods, therefore suiting the scale of small to medium factories where predictive maintenance approaches are most challenging to implement. © 2023 Elsevier B.V..

"A real-time condition monitoring and maintenance management system for low voltage industrial motors using internet-of-things Maintenance and sound operating industrial equipment are critical for any manufacturing company. Standardization of the manufacturing infrastructure and establishment of a systematic maintenance program is essential for this process. However, condition monitoring must also be an integral part of a smart manufacturing program that seeks to improve and optimize the operational efficiency of production systems. Absence of this type of data-driven observations and mindset in manufacturing decision making, may result in safety risks, missing critical signs, or occurrence of unexpected repairs that could bring the equipment to a halt. Moreover, routine maintenance may short the actual useful life of some equipment and when scheduled maintenance shutdowns occur too often, they increase downtime and cost. This paper presents the design and development of a real-time condition monitoring system for managing industrial low voltage motors using internet-of-things. The system can record and monitor vibration and temperature conditions of an industrial motor and transmit the data through a wireless network to a data logging center. The current prototype was developed using open source software and hardware and can successfully identify abnormal motor conditions from sensor input values that exceed predefined setpoints. When a motor is approaching an abnormal condition, the system changes state and informs the user through a mobile alert. The motor management system requires the user to perform an RFID enforced inspection. The alarm system remains active until authorized personnel visits the equipment and scans the dedicated RFID batch. Furthermore, the motor management system can be accessed remotely to allow the user to visualize the current condition of the motor.

"Monitoring and Fault Diagnosis of Breathing Valves in Atmospheric Storage Tank under Fuzzy PID The atmospheric storage tank breathing valve relies too much on manual experience and simple monitoring methods in monitoring and fault diagnosis, and cannot provide high-precision fault diagnosis and prediction. Therefore, this article introduces a monitoring and fault diagnosis system for atmospheric storage tank breathing valves based on Fuzzy PID (Proportional-Integrated-Derivative). The research aims to design the atmospheric storage tank breathing valve system into three modules. The monitoring module uses sensors for data collection, while the early warning module classifies the data based on the monitoring module to find the optimal classification boundary and achieve abnormal state recognition. The fault diagnosis module uses the fuzzy PID algorithm to thoroughly inspect and evaluate the abnormal conditions detected in the atmospheric storage tank, and finally evaluates the monitoring and fault diagnosis of the atmospheric storage tank breathing valve before and after improvement.

"Anomaly Detection in Binary Time Series Data: An unsupervised Machine Learning Approach for Condition Monitoring A key element of smart manufacturing is condition monitoring and heath controlling of production machines. In today's rapidly evolving landscape of industrial machinery and equipment, optimizing the operation of production lines is critical to ensure high productivity and product quality. Timely detection and prevention of faults in the production process plays a crucial role in minimizing downtime, reducing costs, and ensuring optimal performance. The scientific challenge here is that the increasing number of sensors and actuators with digital input and output signals in the production machines creates different patterns, which are difficult to evaluate using conventional statistical methods. Another difficulty is identifying the cause of the failure to be able to intervene rapidly and in a focused manner in the event of irregularities. For this reason, this research study presented a comprehensive analysis of anomaly detection in binary time series data using various machine learning models. The study included preprocessing of the dataset, normalizing the data, and evaluation of the anomaly detection performance of the different models. The accuracy, detection rate, and F1-score are used as evaluation measures. The execution time of each model is also analyzed. In addition, the identification of sensors that cause anomalies is investigated and the impact of false detections is discussed. Experimental results show the strengths and weaknesses of each model and provide valuable insights for selecting the appropriate anomaly detection approach. The Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, DBSCAN, and kMeans models show high precision and detection, while the Autoencoder and Variational Autoencoder models show high precision but lower detection. The one-class Support Vector Machine model achieves balanced performance. AutoML shows excellent results in recognition rate but is not real-time capable.

"Ensemble fog computing architecture for unstable state detection of hydraulic system Failure of machinery and equipment in factories, plants, etc. is a great loss to the operator. Various studies have been conducted for a long time to solve this problem, and many solutions have recently been developed to perform real-time health monitoring by attaching sensors to facilities. In addition, machine learning has allowed more accurate diagnosis of the condition to be carried out on these collected data. However, real-time fault detection is accompanied by a number of difficulties. Class imbalance issues are considered one of the most representative factors that makes it difficult to apply machine learning models in real-world locations. Class imbalance means that when it comes to classification problems, the amount of data in one class is greater than that in another class. In this case, the machine learning model is overfitted to a class with a lot of data, causing performance degradation. In real-world sites, the performance degradation of the model due to class imbalance is very serious because most data occurs in normal state, while fault data does not occur very well. Several prior studies have proposed ways to overcome this class imbalance, but each has several limitations. In this paper, an algorithm solution method and computing architecture solution method are introduced together as methodologies to overcome class imbalance, and a robust classification model is designed for class imbalance. © 2020 The Authors.",2-s2.0-85094595398

This study is centered around a novel deep learning-based model using a 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) for early fault detection in MCT machines. We collected sensor-based data from CNC/MCT machines and applied various preprocessing techniques to prepare the dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that the 1D-CNN model achieves a higher accuracy of 91.57% compared to traditional machine learning classifiers and other deep learning models, including Random Forest (RF) at 89.71%, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) at 87.45%, XGBoost at 89.67%, logistic regression (LR) at 75.93%, support vector machine (SVM) at 75.96%, K-nearest neighbors (KNN) at 82.93%, decision tree at 88.36%, naïve Bayes at 68.31%, long short-term memory (LSTM) at 90.80%, and a hybrid 1D CNN + LSTM model at 88.51%. Moreover, our proposed 1D CNN model outperformed all other mentioned models in precision, recall, and F-1 scores, with 91.87%, 91.57%, and 91.63%, respectively. These findings highlight the efficacy of the 1D CNN model in providing optimal performance with an MCT machine’s dataset, making it particularly suitable for small manufacturing companies seeking to automate early fault detection and classification in CNC and MCT machines. This approach enhances productivity and aids in proactive maintenance and safety measures, demonstrating its potential to revolutionize the manufacturing industry. © 2024 Athar et al.",2-s2.0-85207369163
Regressive event-tracker: A causal prediction modelling of degradation in high speed manufacturing The proposed work describes a dynamic regression based event-tracker for high speed production process. The methodology discussed is a causal system and provides trends and estimations of the sensors based on a flexible regression model of the historical sensor values. A safety threshold is defined that provides a boundary of the tolerant working for the regime condition of production. This threshold is used as a reference to calculate the remaining useful life of the critical component. The estimated remaining useful life is compared with the Weibull reliability analysis. The proposed methodology provides a remaining useful life of ? 10 weeks for the thermal regulator use-case when compared to ? 9 weeks for Weibull analysis. The overestimation of the methodology is discussed and along with the alternative methodology. The sensitivity analysis is conducted on the noise and training periods are studied for better prediction. © 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"Active Current Sensor Fault-Tolerant Control of Induction Motor Drive with Online Neural Network-Based Rotor and Stator Resistance Estimation This article presents an active current sensor (CS) fault-Tolerant control (FTC) strategy for induction motor (IM) drive with adaptation of rotor and stator resistances. The stator current estimator with online adaptation of resistance parameters was applied for the reconstruction of missing current signals. A model reference adaptive system (MRAS), based on a neural network (NN), was used to estimate the rotor resistance. Additionally, stator resistance estimation was applied based on ratio index. The use of such a solution allowed for a significant increase in the quality of stator current reconstruction, which is particularly important for the design of CS fault detection (FD) and compensation algorithms. A wide range of simulation studies have been carried out for different operating conditions of the IM drive. The results showed that applying rotor and stator resistance estimation can improve the quality of stator current estimation by up to approximately 95% under rated operating point. The study was carried out for nominal and low speeds, with two, one, and without healthy CS.  © 2023 Michal Adamczyk et al., published by Sciendo.",2-s2.0-105003812638
"Hybrid Physics-Based and Data-Driven Mitigation Strategy for Automatic Generation Control Under Cyber Attack The fusion of information, data, control and electric power facilitates the electric cyber-physical system (ECPS). In the ECPS, though the high-level cyber-physical interaction and integration increase the flexibility and efficiency of power system operation, the accompanied cyber perils gradually endanger the system security. In fact, several energy sector-targeted attacks, including the infamous Ukraine power grid hack, have shown the power system vulnerability in cybersecurity incidents. Known as the critical power-balancing operation in real-time control systems, automatic generation control (AGC) is a typical ECPS application. Measurements from remote sensors may be manipulated by attackers when telemetered to the AGC center, thereby disrupting the balance of power and frequency stability. In this situation, cyber-attack- tolerant AGC plays an important role in the face of cybersecurity threats. To achieve the cyber-attack-tolerant AGC, some strategies including the physics-based and data-driven attack mitigation schemes have been employed. In this chapter, inspired by the fault detection, diagnosis and reconfiguration in fault-tolerant control theories, a hybrid physics-based and data-driven mitigation model is developed for AGC under false data injection attacks (FDIAs). A mathematical model is derived to reveal the causal relation between the FDIA signal and compromised AGC measurement data. Then, data-driven approaches are employed to establish the mapping between the compromised measurement data and power compensation. Finally, the compensation-based mitigation model is developed. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85153070881
"Maximum likelihood estimation of probabilistically described loads in beam structures In recent years, focus has been shifted towards predictive maintenance in an effort to improve the reliability of operating structures. Processing structural response data obtained from in-situ sensors during operation can provide added value towards this direction. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) methods are uniquely suited for this task; however, accounting for the effect of stochastic structural loads is critical for their robustness. In this work, a framework based on Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is presented, whose goal is to obtain inferences on typically unobservable quantities that describe stochastic structural loading. A structural beam is employed as a demonstrative case study, that is subjected to point loads with stochastic magnitude and application points. The hyperparameters that govern their underlying probability distribution functions (pdf) are the quantities of inferential interest. The inverse (load) identification process is performed using a marginalized MLE objective, where stochastic Monte Carlo (MC) integration is employed to perform the marginalization and Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are used as the optimizer. The Cramer–Rao (CR) lower bound is used to produce 95 % Confidence Intervals (CIs) to quantify estimation uncertainty. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85191293875
"Data-driven remaining useful life prediction based on domain adaptation As an important part of prognostics and health management, remaining useful life (RUL) prediction can provide users and managers with system life information and improve the reliability of maintenance systems. Data-driven methods are powerful tools for RUL prediction because of their great modeling abilities. However, most current data-driven studies require large amounts of labeled training data and assume that the training data and test data follow similar distributions. In fact, the collected data are often variable due to different equipment operating conditions, fault modes, and noise distributions. As a result, the assumption that the training data and the test data obey the same distribution may not be valid. In response to the above problems, this paper proposes a data-driven framework with domain adaptability using a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BGRU). The framework uses a domain-adversarial neural network (DANN) to implement transfer learning (TL) from the source domain to the target domain, which contains only sensor information. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we analyze the IEEE PHM 2012 Challenge datasets and use them for verification. The experimental results show that the generalization ability of the model is effectively improved through the domain adaptation approach. © 2021. Wen et al.",2-s2.0-85116494413

"A framework of dynamic data driven digital twin for complex engineering products: The example of aircraft engine health management Digital twin is a vital enabling technology for smart manufacturing in the era of Industry 4.0. Digital twin effectively replicates its physical asset enabling easy visualization, smart decision-making and cognitive capability in the system. In this paper, a framework of dynamic data driven digital twin for complex engineering products was proposed. To illustrate the proposed framework, an example of health management on aircraft engines was studied. This framework models the digital twin by extracting information from the various sensors and Industry Internet of Things (IIoT) monitoring the remaining useful life (RUL) of an engine in both cyber and physical domains. Then, with sensor measurements selected from linear degradation models, a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network is proposed to dynamically update the digital twin, which can estimate the most up-to-date RUL of the physical aircraft engine. Through comparison with other machine learning algorithms, including similarity based linear regression and feed forward neural network, on RUL modelling, this LSTM based dynamical data driven digital twin provides a promising tool to accurately replicate the health status of aircraft engines. This digital twin based RUL technique can also be extended for health management and remote operation of manufacturing systems. © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",2-s2.0-85120652016
"Requirements towards optimizing analytics in industrial processes Modern production systems are composed of complex manufacturing processes with highly technology specific cause-effect relationships. Developments in sensor technology and computational science allow for data-driven decision making that facilitate efficient and objective production management. However, process data may only be beneficial if it is enriched with meta information and process expertise, reduced to relevant information and modelling results interpreted correctly. The importance of data integration in the heterogeneous industrial environment rises at the same momentum as new metrology techniques are deployed. In this paper, we focus on optimizing analytics, containing data-driven decision making for predictive quality and maintenance.

"Condition monitoring of multi-material lightweight components through a sensitive outer skin using Fiber-Bragg-Grating sensors Multi-material structures for lightweight applications are continuously gaining increased importance, especially in future industries, such as wind power or electro mobility. Material combinations of metal and fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites subjected to high or cyclic loads are critical at the interface. The integration of sensors in multi-material components allows for additional functionalities from needs-based maintenance to continuous condition monitoring and fault detection. In addition, the obtained data even further allows the exploitation of the full potential for lightweight design. Inspired by nature and following the concept of Biological Transformation, the technical approach for the implementation of condition monitoring on multi-material components makes use of the periosteum in the endoskeleton of vertebrates as a bionic model. This concept was adopted for metal-FRP multi-material combinations with the integration of Fiber-Bragg-Grating (FBG) sensors within the FRP. By subjecting components to vibration by external excitation, damages in form of delamination were successfully detected by analyzing the state-dependent natural frequencies of the component. Test specimens were prepared and the influence of various parameters such as frequency, location and direction of the excitation as well as the fixture of the samples during excitation on the natural frequency was investigated. The approach was further demonstrated on the example of a component from the sports industry. The chosen snowboard is expected to fulfill lightweight requirements on the one hand while being exposed to irregular high loads. © 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.",2-s2.0-85136293445
"On making factories smarter through actionable predictions based on time-series data The emergence of the Industrial Internet of Things paves the way for enhancing the real-time monitoring capabilities of contemporary factories. This can be materialised through sensors collecting data which can be further analysed. This paradigm enables the detection of indicators concerning systems' degradation and facilitates corrective actions to be performed ahead of time. In this paper, we propose a damage prediction framework exploiting data that are coming from the core IT system in a steel industry use case. The novelty of our approach lies in the exploitation of Deep Learning techniques over streaming operational sensor data. To evaluate the framework, real-life data are collected and analysed based on daily operational activities enriched with the Remaining Useful Life (RUL). The Remaining Useful Life is automatically computed. We also periodically align the damage attribute, which is recorded in the planned activities and is performed by the maintenance engineers.

"A hybrid bond graph model-based - Data driven method for failure prognostic Failure prognostic builds up on constant data acquisition and processing and fault diagnosis and is an essential part of predictive maintenance of smart manufacturing systems enabling condition based maintenance, optimised use of plant equipment, improved uptime and yield and to prevent safety problems. Given known control inputs into a plant and real sensor outputs or simulated measurements, the model-based part of the proposed hybrid method provides numerical values of unknown parameter degradation functions at sampling time points by the evaluation of equations that have been derived offline from a bicausal diagnostic bond graph. These numerical values are computed concurrently to the constant monitoring of a system and are stored in a buffer of fixed length. The data-driven part of the method provides a sequence of remaining useful life estimates by repeated projection of the parameter degradation into the future based on the use of values in a sliding time window. Existing software can be used to determine the best fitting function and can account for its random parameters. The continuous parameter estimation and their projection into the future can be performed in parallel for multiple isolated simultaneous parametric faults on a multicore, multiprocessor computer. The proposed hybrid bond graph model-based, data-driven method is verified by an offline simulation case study of a typical power electronic circuit.

"Knowledge-Based Integration of Product Data in IoT-Platforms to Optimize Resource Efficiency In times of a global climate crisis, the industrial digitalization offers potential to economize on resources. PDM systems are a viable solution to organize product data in a single, central integration platform. These systems enhance the human workforce by managing product data and integrating modern CAx tools during the product development. Industrial IoT platforms on the other hand gain more significance in the integration and management of smart production processes expanding the data flow over later phases of the product lifecycle. However, between development stages and different data systems the loss of information due to media breaks in the value chain impedes the usage of a holistic data model. The underlying goal is to develop a complete digital representation during all phases of the product development. To expand the digital data model over the whole product lifecycle, the data exchange processes, and the path to a single true data model are the focus of method addressed in this paper. The collection and analysis of data from multiple sources in the production and usage phase have the potential to significantly optimize the resource efficiency over the whole product lifecycle by providing relevant product information at key stages of the product lifecycle.

"Development of a Machine Learning based model for Damage Detection, Localization and Quantification to extend Structure Life Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has been researched for a long time and continues to be an active area of research. Initial work on SHM involved identification of hand-crafted features and predictive models relied on statistical methods. The recent improvements in computing capabilities, coupled with better integration of sensor data, has led to the emergence of more effective techniques in terms of scalability and predictive power. Machine learning offers a solution through automatic feature extraction algorithms, and scalable and noise robust models. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been used as state-of-art classifiers for images as well as for text. This paper proposes the use of the monitored structure's transmissibility functions for the structure under observation, which can be fed into a novel composite architecture consisting of Deep CNN followed by multivariate linear regressors to detect, localize, and quantify the damage extent in a system. The proposed method was tested on the Los Alamos' Eight degree-of-freedom (DOF) structure, and the Structural Beam Data from Laboratory of Mechanical Vibrations and Rotor Dynamics, University of Chile. This study on damage localization and quantification can be leveraged to comment on the safety and soundness of the structure under inspection and can help in making more informed inferences.

"Unsupervised Learning Based Diagnosis Model for Anomaly Detection of Motor Bearing with Current Data Lifecycle engineering is a key concept for promoting environmentally sustainable practices among manufacturing firms. A key aspect of life cycle management for pursuing sustainability is condition-based maintenance system that uses data analytics process such as anomaly detection to understand machine condition. Conventional machine learning technique applied to anomaly detection uses classifiers based on supervised learning to detect anomalies of motor bearings using the bearing specifications. However, supervised learning generally requires a large volume of data at the time of abnormal operation, which takes time to acquire. This paper therefore proposes a data analytics process to detect motor bearing failure using data during normal condition. In the data analytics process, we first make a power spectrum from current sensor signals. Then, after grouping a power spectrum into bins, we employ a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to learn the normal condition of a motor bearing. Next, we calculate likelihood with the GMM to check for any difference from the normal condition. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can show increasing anomaly of a bearing condition corresponding to insufficient grease. © 2021 Elsevier B.V..

"Ultra low power wireless multi-sensor platform dedicated to machine tool condition monitoring The H2020 PreCoM project aims at developing and deploying a predictive cognitive maintenance decision-support system for production equipment such as machine tools. The PreCoM system intends to identify and localize damage, predict its evolution, assess remaining lifetime, and increase in-service efficiency of machines by conducting preventive maintenance actions. In this PreCoM system, additional sensors are needed to gather measurements close to critical parts/tools in order to improve failure detection. Commercial wireless sensor nodes are too restrictive regarding requirements for condition monitoring on industrial machine tools (50 g acceleration, 50 m long wireless range, several month lifetime, presence of cooling fluid and hot metal chips projection). Therefore, a dedicated wireless multi-sensor platform has been designed and developed in the frame of this project in order to provide additional measurements on highly moving parts, such as spindle head. The PreCoM wireless sensor nodes are integrating a 50 g / 10 kHz - 3 axes accelerometer and a temperature sensor. They have been designed to be standalone devices with lifetime of around 1 year, and to fit all the machine tool environment requirements. The wireless sensor nodes are based on ultra-low power electronic devices and communication protocols to minimize their power consumption during all phases: sensing, communication and sleeping mode.

"Affecting the Grand Trifecta—Integration of Condition Assessment Program to Launch Multi-Billion Dollar Capital Improvement Program Updates The Trinity River Authority of Texas (TRA) is currently conducting a Wastewater Interceptor Condition Assessment Program (Program) for over 100 mi of unlined reinforced concrete pipes (RCP) throughout the Central Regional Wastewater System (CRWS) collection system by means of Multiple Sensor Inspection (MSI). The MSI data will be used to determine the remaining wall thickness of the piping, which in turn will be utilized to calculate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of the unlined RCP interceptors within the CRWS collection system. Rather than initiate reactionary multi-million-dollar capital projects due to pipeline failures and after-the-fact maintenance records, TRA has launched a proactive multi-pronged approach to the development of their multi-billion-dollar Capital Improvement Program (CIP). The program development consists of three major components: a condition assessment (the basis of this abstract), a hydraulic modeling update to evaluate capital investment using an optioneering approach, and a detailed linear storage or tunnel storage options analysis. Each of these components will be integrated with optimization driven by Optimatics Optimizer software. TRA has been a power user of the InfoWorks ICM software and related precursor products since 1998. These varying design philosophies drive towards the best or most optimal investment strategy that benefits TRA’s customer cities with the clearest view towards long-term financial considerations and built-in flexibility. The majority of the unlined RCP pipelines within the CRWS collection system are in similar, poor condition due to corrosion from low velocities and elevated levels of hydrogen sulfide. TRA has adopted an integrated condition assessment approach to tackle the challenging task of prioritizing pipeline rehabilitation and replacement. By incorporating the development of risk factors specific to TRA’s concerns and calculated RUL, the Program is establishing a robust, cyclical, and dynamic data and risk management process for asset management-driven decision-making. As part of this integrated approach, optimization technology is being leveraged to develop several rehabilitation scenarios that account for risk as well as overall cost. This program will establish a planning process for identifying specific assets for rehabilitation and/or replacement, a prioritized approach to bundle relevant assets into capital projects, and leverages optimization technology that identifies several scenarios to minimize cost, mitigate risk, and maximize organization value.

"Online Measurement and Detection Technology and its Optimized Application in Intelligent Manufacturing Environment In the intelligent manufacturing environment, online metrology and detection technology ensures the consistency and stability of product quality by real-time monitoring and analysis of key data in the production process. However, traditional online detection methods face challenges such as insufficient accuracy, delayed response and high cost, which affect production efficiency and quality control. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an optimization scheme based on multi-sensor fusion, machine learning algorithm, adaptive control, intelligent fault prediction and edge computing technology. First, multiple sensors are used for data collection, integrating multimodal information such as vision, laser, and ultrasound to improve measurement accuracy. Second, the detection model is optimized through machine learning algorithms, and adaptive control technology dynamically adjusts the production process according to real-time data. Intelligent fault prediction analyzes historical data to provide early warning of equipment problems, and edge computing improves the real-time and efficiency of data processing. Experimental results show that the surface defect detection accuracy of the optimized system is 98%, production efficiency is improved by about 60%, and the scrap rate is reduced by 4.85%. This research provides practical solutions for quality control and production optimization in intelligent manufacturing, significantly improves the intelligence and automation level of the production line, and promotes the development of the manufacturing industry in a direction of higher efficiency, lower cost, and higher precision. © 2025 The Authors.

"Advanced Predictive Maintenance of Phoenix Contact Relays: A Digital Twin and Machine Learning Approach Predictive maintenance (PdM) leveraging digital twin technology offers a transformative approach to maintaining industrial equipment, minimizing downtime, and reducing maintenance costs. We focus on the predictive maintenance of Phoenix Contact relays using a comprehensive dataset of relay sensor readings (the Phoenix Contact Relay dataset). By implementing advanced machine learning models, including a bagging and boosting model, different types of LSTM, and an Autoencoder with a fully connected neural network, we aim to predict relay failures accurately. Our approach involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, and feature augmentation to create the dataset that improves the predictive capabilities of these models. To provide a dynamic, real-time representation of the relay, We use a digital twin framework that continuously simulates its behavior and predicts potential failures. This integration tries to improve the accuracy but also provides insights into the underlying causes of relay degradation.

"Condition-Based Monitoring and Novel Fault Detection Based on Incremental Learning Applied to Rotary Systems Thanks to the development of new technologies such as sensor networks and advanced computational power, the research field of condition-based monitoring (CBM) has drawn increasing attention in manufacturing. With the aim of enhancing equipment reliability, leading to a reduction in maintenance costs, one of the most crucial challenges dealing with CBM is the detection or prediction of unseen/uncharacterized event during manufacturing system operation. Therefore, the identification of novel fault conditions and learning of new patterns are believed to be an important and mandatory thrust in CBM research. In this work, a convolutional neural networks and autoencoder (CNN-AE) based incremental learning method is presented. It applies CNN-AE to identify various types and severities of faults under scenarios of previously unseen fault conditions. In this method, the spectrograms generated from raw sensory signals are acquired and labelled along with working condition information via inspection. A model composed of two sub-models for novel fault identification is then constructed and trained using the time-frequency spectrograms of available conditions of operation from a rotary system. One sub-model based on CNN is for known fault classification and the other sub-model based on AE is for novelty detection, where the two sub-models share an architecture for improving efficiency and accuracy. Finally, incremental learning is performed to retrain the model with the data identified as a novel fault condition. The performance of this method is validated via an experimental case study conducted on a fault machinery simulator. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.",2-s2.0-85127467442

"Deep Learning Gas Engine Health Assessment With the objective to reduce greenhouse emissions, efforts have gone to increase the integration of alternative fuels such as natural gas in the transportation sector. Using natural gas as automobile fuel has several advantages over petrol and diesel: lower costs, better combustion efficiency, and the possibility to produce it through a biomass conversion process. Natural gas-based engines have become a crucial asset in the South American transportation sector. However, the share of natural-gas vehicles in the current vehicle market is still estimated to be below 5%. Therefore, to incentivize investments and development in gas engines, it is imperative to ensure their reliability, availability, and sustainability; by developing reliability analysis and identifying critical components, probability of failure, and better operating conditions. These assessments can later be used to design tailored maintenance policies, thus reducing maintenance and operational costs. This paper presents a deep learning-based prognostics analysis for gas engines from a fleet of heavy-duty trucks (HDTs) from a Colombian company. These HDTs operate under varying demand profiles, including continuous stops and runs, long trajectories, steep hills, and frequent load-unload cycles. The dataset presents two challenges during the preprocessing stage, namely: the raw dataset does not include any kind of labels, and the sensors present an irregular sampling frequency. Thus, the analysis on this paper focuses on addressing these preprocessing challenges to later train prognostics models for the remaining useful life (RUL) estimation of the gas engine fleet. Results show that by implementing an adequate preprocessing methodology, promising results can be obtained for the engine's RUL. © 2022 Probabilistic Safety Assessment and Management, PSAM 2022.

"Degradation Modelling and Prognostics of Rotating Equipment with Automated Machine Learning Evaluating and predicting equipment degradation is essential to the reliability and safety of mechanical equipment systems. Condition monitoring based on sensors measuring vibration signals has emerged as the most well-established method for enabling detection and prediction of the health state of rotating equipment. One of the most well-established methods for degradation modelling based on vibration signals is Weibull distribution. Most recent approaches take advantage of Machine Learning (ML) and deep learning to generate prognostics insights. On the other hand, AutoML automates the configuration of ML pipelines to achieve a higher level of automation. Therefore, it has the credentials to enable predictive maintenance applications by optimizing the adopted predictive models; however, the exploitation of AutoML in rotating machine prognostics is an underexplored area. In this paper, we model the degradation procedure according to the Weibull distribution, we extract, combine, and compare various time-domain features, and we apply the H2O AutoML framework for providing predictions about the future health state of the rotating machinery.

"Seamless Edge-Server Collaboration for Real-Time Digital Twin in Machining Process With the rise of smart manufacturing systems aimed at creating efficient and cost-effective environments for mass production, various process data acquisition techniques and data models have been developed for CNC manufacturing to enable the creation of Digital Twin (DT) models. This article proposes an edge-server collaborative data architecture collecting crucial CNC machine data, including servo motor parameters, cutting tool information, and sensor data such as vibration, pressure, and temperature. The architecture is designed to process real-Time data during mass production with minimal latency, considering the high-speed nature of machining processes, while also storing historical data in a Data Lake for the development of AI models. An infrastructure for Digital Twin of the brake disc machining process is created, a particularly challenging task due to the complex geometry of the disc and the unique material characteristics of cast iron. During machining, sudden tool failures or even brake disc breakages can occur due to the heterogeneous nature of cast iron. Given that brake discs are critical safety components in automobiles, monitoring process data linked to the cast iron and cutting tool supply chain during mass production is essential. Digital Shadow serves as a foundation for real-Time anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, and tool wear prediction models. This paper also proposes several deterministic modeling approaches for real-Time anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, and remaining useful life predictions for cutting tools. These models leverage machine data such as spindle and feed-drive motor currents, load, and positional errors during brake disc machining, in combination with sensor data, including temperature, pressure, electrical power, and vibration, to enhance the monitoring and optimization of the machining process.  © 2025 The Authors.",2-s2.0-105003238610

"Resource-efficient Edge AI solution for predictive maintenance Data-driven predictive maintenance (PM) is an approach that leverages advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and sensor data to predict when equipment failure might occur, and to perform maintenance just in time to prevent it, reducing downtime and maintenance costs. In manufacturing, one of the biggest potential applications for intelligent PM systems is tool condition monitoring (TCM). TCM aims to monitor tool wear in real-time, ensuring the quality of the manufactured products and the safety of the surrounding people and equipment. In recent decades, many studies have been carried out on tool condition monitoring for different machining operations such as milling, drilling or turning, and have demonstrated the effectiveness of various AI algorithms. Recent advances in hardware have made it possible for edge devices to run complex AI algorithms locally. This technology is called Edge AI. The Edge AI approach has several key benefits such as reduced latency, scalability, data privacy and security that can accelerate the integration of the PM solution for TCM at the production level. This paper presents the design of an Edge AI system for tool condition monitoring, consisting of state-of-the-art, low-cost components and using open-source software.

"Digitization Workflow for Data Mining in Production Technology applied to a Feed Axis of a CNC Milling Machine Condition monitoring and predictive maintenance applications receive ongoing scientific attention in production technology. Larger companies, especially machine and component manufacturers, already offer related products. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular show interest in developing and offering solutions in this market themselves to gain economic advantages, to improve resource utilization of their machines or to be able to offer these advantages to their own customers. In the development process, however, they often encounter problems already in the digitization of the machines. The first hurdle is to obtain an analysis-capable data set. This is due to the fact that common and established general data mining development process models, such as CRISP-DM, do not focus on production technology, causing difficulties for engineers during deployment. A problem with existing process models is the limited practicality in the engineering domain due to restricted adaptability. In a previous paper, a guideline for engineers for data mining suitable digitization of production machines was developed in order to solve these problems. The related results were provided in the context of a project for condition monitoring of mixing machines. In this paper, the proposed method is applied to components of a 5-axis CNC milling machine in three different monitoring use cases.

"Digital Twins for predictive maintenance: A case study for a flexible IT-architecture The Digital Twin offers great potential for use in predictive maintenance applications to prevent failures of critical components. However, due to the absence of standardized defined functionalities of Digital Twins and the associated software tools, the creation of Digital Twins is linked to a high expenditure of resources. This effort is due to static connections of components within the IT-architecture, which cannot be reused for other Digital Twins, as these IT-architectures are mainly single-case solutions. Although there are approaches for creating flexible IT-architectures, these have not yet been examined in depth for their reusability to build Digital Twins with different implementation conditions. Therefore, the goal of this case study is to investigate the reusability and the associated reduction of effort involved in building Digital Twins. For this purpose, the approaches of an IoT-platform and a service-oriented architecture are combined to create a reusable and flexible IT-architecture for Digital Twins. This IT-architecture is applied to a first use case of a Digital Twin for a compressor and then adapted to a second use case of a Digital Twin for a wind turbine. These use cases have different implementation conditions, but both find application in predictive maintenance. Finally, the reusability is evaluated and, in this context, the extent to which the resources required for building Digital Twins can be reduced when utilizing a flexible IT-architecture. © 2023 The Authors.

"Multi-scale cnn for multi-sensor feature fusion in helical gear fault detection Fault detection and diagnosis of helical gears under high speed and heavy load conditions are rarely researched comparing with spur gears under light load and low speed conditions. It is a fact that the working conditions of helical gears are very complicated, thus multiple sensors mounted on its different locations can provide complementary information on fault detection and diagnosis.

MSMFCNN contains three parts, including a conventional one-dimensional CNN part, a multi-scale multi-sensor feature fusion part, and an output part. To better understand this network, theoretical foundation of MSMFCNN is given. Moreover, in order to demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments are carried out on a parallel shaft gearbox test rig on which multiple acceleration sensors are mounted for data acquisition.

The absence of a systematic maintenance program and data-driven mindset in making manufacturing decisions may result in serious safety risks, unexpected equipment damages, and financial strain. Condition monitoring and predictive maintenance management systems are commonly used in tandem with the Internet of Things, linking sensors on machines and transmitting the data through a wireless network to a data-logging center that will allow further analysis and support decision making. The system described in this paper measures vibrations using sensors attached to low voltage motors and then utilizes a two-phase machine learning approach for predictive maintenance. In the first phase, we conducted an analysis to look for any abnormal behavior, and in the second phase, we attempted to determine the type of specific faults that may occur. The proposed predictive maintenance system aims to reduce the fault detection time and assist with diagnosing the type of fault occurring. We utilized and tested three machine learning algorithms to detect abnormal motor behavior: support vector machine, backpropagation neural network, and random forest. For predicting the type of specific motor faults that may occur, we used a support vector machine. This two-phase machine learning approach demonstrated promising results in detecting abnormal behavior in low voltage motors. Therefore, integrating this machine learning component as a part of a predictive maintenance system can result in high confidence about the motor condition, reduce maintenance cost, and enhance the safety of the operators and the machines. © 2022 The Authors.

"Self-Attention Transformer-Based Architecture for Remaining Useful Life Estimation of Complex Machines Meaningful feature extraction from multivariate time-series data is still challenging since it takes into account the correlation between pairs of sensors as well as the temporal information of each time-series. Meanwhile, the huge industrial system has evolved into a data-rich environment, resulting in the rapid development and deployment of deep learning for machine RUL prediction. RUL (Remaining Useful Life) examines a system's behavior over the course of its lifetime, that is, from the last inspection to when the system's performance deteriorates beyond a certain point. RUL has been addressed using Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolution Neural Network (CNN), particularly in complex tasks involving high-dimensional nonlinear data. The main focus, however, has been on degradation data. In 2021, a new realistic run-to-failure turbofan engine degradation dataset was released, which differs significantly from the simulation dataset. The key difference is that each cycle's flight duration varies, so the existing deep technique will be ineffective at predicting the RUL for real-world degradation data. We present a Self-Attention Transformer-Based Encoder model to address this problem. The encoder with the time-stamp encoder layer works in parallel to extract features from various sensors at various time stamps. Self-attention enables efficient processing of extended sequences and focuses on key elements of the input time series. Self-attention is used in the proposed Transformer model to access global characteristics from diverse time-series representations. Under real-world flight conditions, we conduct tests on turbofan engine degradation data using variable-length input. The proposed approach for estimating RUL of turbofan engines appears to be efficient based on empirical results.  © 2022 The Authors. Published by ELSEVIER B.V.",2-s2.0-85163889619
"Scalable Remote Cloud Data Center for Vessel Equipment Predictive Maintenance Service-as-a-Product (SaaP) Predictive maintenance is gradually replacing conventional preventive maintenance, through an informed decision-making process for a fleet operator to proactively monitor the health status of the sea-based equipment and machinery. As a result, the fleet operator will only need to ask for on-time repair and maintenance services instead of periodic maintenance, which saves both time and cost significantly. While moving into this new maritime business model, which is also known as Service-as-a-Product (SaaP), both fleet operators and maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) companies could also build a stronger collaboration in the maritime industries. With the advent of digital transformation towards Industry 4.0 (I4.0), the Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) renders the massive collection of operational and machinery process data from the vessel equipment through sensorization, where these collected real-time information are useful for advanced analytics to predict equipment failure and to avoid unplanned downtime. Unlike other industries, there are a few challenges in the maritime industries when developing a centralized smart vessel equipment monitoring platform. One of the key challenges, is the lack of a feasible data management system, requires the centralized host must be able to handle and manage the telemetry IoT data that is transmitted over the satellite communication, by complying with all cybersecurity considerations and regulations in maritime sector. In this paper, we present a scalable, hybrid cloud-based data management framework that can connect to multiple edge systems where each system is deployed on a physical vessel, to establish a scalable SaaP business model. Hence, the ship-to-shore sensorized data can be processed and monitored via a real-time visualization dashboard through the centralized cloud-based platform. We argue that our approach, would be a turn-key solution that can be implemented for mostly all types of marine equipment and machinery, and thus to further improve the prediction tools to support advanced decision-making techniques, such as optimal time repair of vessel equipment. © 2023 The Authors.

"Remote motor condition monitoring using IoT and Machine Learning: A predictive approach A data-driven approach for predictive motor maintenance supports industrial automation. The approach leverages the integration of Internet of Things and machine learning to create a scalable solution. The system employs an array of sensors, including current, voltage, temperature, and humidity, connected to an ESP8266 microcontroller.

"An AI-enhanced Approach for optimizing life cycle costing of military logistic vehicles Individual usage profile (aka true usage profile) of military logistic vehicles (MLV) is highly dependent on types of operations, duration and areas of use. Compared to non-military vehicles, the operation life is considerably longer, mileage tends to be several times lower and the characteristics of the application area, including environmental factors, is much more diverse. Transparent and realistic determination of MLV's true usage profile facilitates, inter alia, optimal life cycle costing in particular operation costs. In practice, however, effects of non-usage, such as material degradation or damage during service of the vehicles are not explicitly recorded. Important aspects of assets management, such as identifying maintenance measures and logistic disposition calculations, are often conducted non-systematically and non-data driven but rather based on human experiential knowledge and manufacturer's specifications. Hence, the modelling and predictive analysis of MLV's true usage profile is subject to significant uncertainties. The body of knowledge in assets management does not consider the aforementioned problems. Therefore, lack of novel AI-enhanced approaches for modelling MLV's true usage profile is evident. This paper introduces an integrative, data-driven approach for identifying the true usage profile and thus improving the life cycle costing of MLV. The proposed approach involves an AI-enhanced analysis of heterogeneous data sources, such as sensor-, vehicle control-, GPS-, and logistics data as well as textual logbooks. It enables a transparent and realistic identification of MLV's true usage profiles, which facilitates accurate and timely calculation of life cycle costs under consideration of data quality properties. Finally yet importantly, classification of usage profiles enables a data-driven decision support system to provide i) proactive maintenance measures, and ultimately ii) to optimize distribution of vehicles and spare parts in decentralized warehouses. © 2022 Elsevier B.V..

"Joint Identification, Detection and Channel Estimation in Industrial IoT Rapid identification and analysis of faulty or degraded sensors and devices are key challenge in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Wireless communication is emerging as a viable solution to support the massive sensors and devices with sporadic fault due to low construction cost, low latency and high reliability. For future massive machine-type communications, Media-Based Modulation (MBM) is regarded as a promising technique to achieve high data rate with low-complexity hardware implementation. In this paper, only the sensors or devices with fault are activated to transmit data which use MBM to carry more fault information.

"Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Remaining Useful Life Estimation of a Vapor Recovery Unit System Prognostics and health management (PHM) has become a key instrument in the reliability community. Great efforts have gone into estimating systems' remaining useful life (RUL) by taking advantage of monitoring data and data-driven models (DDMs). The latter have gained significant attention since they are model-independent and do not require previous knowledge of the system under study. This is known as black-box behavior. However, DDMs developed for PHM frameworks are commonly tested on simulated or experimental data sets, which do not present the characteristics and intricacies of data collected from monitoring sensor networks in real systems. Furthermore, the black-box behavior hinders DDMs' interpretability, and thus suffers trustworthiness, for example in maintenance decision-making processes. To address this, physics-informed models have been implemented through hybrid models, which present significant improvements in accuracy and interpretability. Particularly, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been proposed in deep learning (DL) to both solve and discover a system's governing partial differential equation (PDE). This paper presents an implementation of a PINN-RUL model to a case study from a real complex engineering system (CES). The system consists of a vapor recovery unit (VRU) at an offshore oil production platform. Challenges when creating RUL labels based on maintenance logs are discussed. Results show that a trained PINN-RUL model successfully allows the interpretation of a real system's degradation dynamics through a latent variable. © 2022 Probabilistic Safety Assessment and Management, PSAM 2022.

"Multi-level Federated Learning for Industry 4.0 - A Crowdsourcing Approach Federated learning is one of the emerging areas of research in computer science. It has shown great potential in some application areas and we are witnessing evidence of new approaches where millions or even billions of IoT devices can contribute collectively to achieve a common goal of machine learning through federation. However, existing approaches are primarily suitable for single-task learning with a single objective in a single task owner where it is assumed that the majority of devices contributing to federated learning have a similar design or device type and restrictions. We argue that the true potential of federated learning can only be realised if we have a dynamic and open ecosystem where devices, industrial units, machine manufacturers, non-governmental agencies, and governmental entities can contribute toward learning for multiple tasks and objectives in a crowdsourced manner. In this article, we propose a multi-level framework that shows how federated learning, IoT, and crowdsourcing can come hand-in-hand with each other to make a robust ecosystem of multi-level federated learning for Industry 4.0. This helps build future intelligent applications for Industry 4.0 such as predictive maintenance and fault detection for systems in smart manufacturing units. In addition, we also highlight several use-cases of multi-level federated learning where this approach can be implemented in Industry 4.0. Moreover, if the approach is implemented successfully, besides enhancement in performance it will also help towards a greater common goal e.g. UN Sustainable Goal No 13 i.e. reduction in carbon footprint.  © 2022 The Authors.

"Research on the dynamic positioning of remotely operated vehicles applied to underwater inspection and repair of hydraulic structures Hydraulic structures (such as dams and aqueducts) can suffer from damages, such as cracks and collapse due to natural aging as well as the impact of natural disasters (such as earthquakes and floods). Determining underwater damage is generally not easy because of significant concealment and safety hazards. Remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) have gradually become capable assistants for the regular underwater maintenance of hydraulic structures. With disturbances from undercurrents and propeller reactions, achieving precise positioning of ROVs has always been a complicated technical problem, and it is also one of the important factors affecting underwater inspections and repair accuracy. To address the environmental disturbances during ROV dynamic positioning, a fuzzy predictive control algorithm combining fuzzy control and model predictive control is proposed in this paper. This algorithm can dynamically adjust the power output of propellers in real-time according to the undercurrent data measured by sensors and carry out differential correction until the ROV reaches the predetermined position. Moreover, the aim of this paper is to analyze disturbances in the longitudinal (X), lateral (Y), and depth (Z) directions during the motion of the ROV. The parameters are adjusted through the algorithm to simulate the dynamic positioning of the ROV's spatial movements. By setting different external environmental conditions, the power adjustment strategy and different dynamic positioning performances of ROVs can be obtained to enhance the adaptability of ROVs in complex environments and their stability in underwater inspection and repair and improve their underwater operation quality and efficiency. © 2023 Author(s).",2-s2.0-85172934426
"Predictive Maintenance System for Wafer Transfer Robot Using Gaussian Mixture Model and Mean-Shift Clustering Equipment maintenance is the technology of monitoring the condition of equipment and predicting the error of the equipment. As an interest in equipment maintenance increases, many studies are being conducted on methods for minimizing economic losses due to equipment failure or enormous maintenance costs, especially in the semiconductor manufacturing field. In this paper, a new predictive maintenance (PdM) method is proposed to predict the error of the wafer transfer robot and to classify the significance level of the error. The experimental data of the wafer transfer robot were collected using acceleration sensor. To analyse the data, pre-processing was performed using fast Fourier transformation (FFT). The error levels were defined by classifying the number of error areas into 1, 2 and 3 regions. The Gaussian mixture model (GMM) algorithm was used to classify normal and abnormal states and mean-shift (MS) algorithm was used to classify the error level for the data classified as abnormal state. The proposed method can detect errors and classify the error level accurately in the data where normal data and error data were mixed. The advantage of the proposed method is that it can accurately distinguish errors from normal data by applying GMM with higher accuracy that previous studies and classify the level of errors using MS. © 2024 The Authors.

"Abnormal vibration detection in the bearing-shaft system via semi-supervised classification of accelerometer signal patterns Several methods have been proposed for fault detection in mechanical systems based on sensor signals. It is preferable that corresponding label for each sensor signal should be provided and analyzed via appropriate supervised classification methods. However, the label information about a system's status often does not perfectly pair to the corresponding data. Therefore, we apply a semi-supervised classification for fault detection using pattern extraction of multivariate signals. This approach transforms continuous time series into a set of contiguous bins via multivariate discretization. Then, we identify informative patterns in the system states, by using a self-training method with limited label information. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed extraction method, five accelerometer signals are collected from a bearing-shaft system. The proposed method successfully reveals informative fault patterns that can be applied as references for fault detection.

"A Decision-Based Framework for Predictive Maintenance Technique Selection in Industry 4.0 Maintenance is defined as the actions that allow machines and equipment to work for an extended period of time by retaining and restoring equipment to its original state. In Industry 4.0 context, Predictive Maintenance (PdM) is a strategy that utilizes digitized sensor data and data analytics to continuously monitor the state of machine components or processes to determine when and where maintenance actions may be required. There are five key types of PdM techniques being used in practice: experience-based, model-based, physical-based; data-driven; and hybrid. Selecting the most suitable PdM technique for a given setup or scenario is critical for any successful PdM implementation in industry to optimize cost and time.

"A deep hybrid network for significant wave height estimation The influence of weather conditions on sea state, and in particular on the dynamic evolution of waves, is an important issue that affects several areas, including maritime traffic and the planning of coastal works. To collect relevant data, buoys are used to set up distributed sensor networks along coastal areas. However, unfavourable weather conditions can lead to downtime, which can be extended due to maintenance issues. The ability to improve the robustness of these sensor systems using predictive models, i.e. digital twins, to interpolate and extrapolate missing data is an important and growing area of research. To accomplish such a task, models must be found that can account for both the spatial and temporal dynamics of the input data to correctly estimate the variables of interest.

"Intelligent prognostics of machining tools based on adaptive variational mode decomposition and deep learning method with attention mechanism In the modern manufacturing industry, remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of the machining tools plays a significant role in promoting machining efficiency, ensuring product quality and reducing production costs. In recent years, many data-driven prognostic approaches have been developed for machining tools, but few of them have considered the operating conditions such as spindle load and rotating speed that may have great impact on the degradation behavior and sensor signals. It may give rise to more uncertainty and lead to an obvious decrease in prediction accuracy when operating condition changes. Besides, feature extraction from the raw signals that are nonstationary, nonlinear, and mixed with abundant noise is essential but quite challenging. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel prognostic approach for machining tools under dynamic operating condition with varying spindle load. In the proposed approach, an adaptive variational mode decomposition (VMD) is newly developed to adaptively search the optimal parameters for processing the raw vibration data, then several components with good trendability and noise robustness are obtained for feature extraction. Furthermore, a deep learning model combining one-dimensional convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) with attention mechanism is constructed to perform RUL prediction. Numerical experiments on a real-world case study show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach in comparison with other baseline data-driven approaches. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",2-s2.0-85089841282

"A confidence-guided DS fault diagnosis method for tidal stream turbines blade Tidal stream turbines (TST) are susceptible to fouling by organisms and suffer blade faults. Accurate blade fault diagnosis is of great significance. The single sensor-based diagnosis methods generally cannot meet the requirement for high-quality blade fault diagnosis, especially in complex underwater environments affected by the swell effects and turbid water. To address this issue, a confidence-guided Dempster-Shafer (CDS) method is proposed for multi-blade fault diagnosis. Specifically, the proposed CDS method adaptively fuses the stator current signals and images in the decision-level fusion module, which designs the confidence coefficients of the stator current signals and images to adaptively fuse the two sensor signals with complementary fault features and diagnosis performance. The proposed CDS method alleviates the limitations of the stator current signal-based methods in diagnosing multi-blade faults under the swell effects and the limitations of the image-based methods in turbid water states. The comparative experiments and ablation experiments on a 230 W TST prototype verified that the proposed CDS method achieves high diagnosis accuracy in the swell effects and turbid water environments. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85200128469
"Finite-time observer-based fault detection with nonfragile control design for switched nonlinear networked systems with time-delays The strategy of observer-based nonfragile control and fault-detection over finite-time horizon has been examined for a class of uncertain switched nonlinear networked control systems (NNCSs) contingent with time varying delays inferred by the networks from sensor to controller and controller to actuator. Also, in this study, an observer-based fault detection control has been designed for the NNCSs. By making use of fault detection control as residual generator, the conveyed fault detection problem is then transformed into (Formula presented.) attenuation problem. By employing multiple Lyapunov function and average dwell time (ADT) approach, sufficient conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) ensures the finite-time boundedness (FTB) criterion of the resulting switched NNCSs with a prescribed disturbance attenuation. Subsequently, the preferred LMIs constraints realizes the controller and observer gains. Finally, two numerical examples are proffered to showcase the efficacity of the proposed technique. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2-s2.0-85171995247
"Application of instantaneous phase detection technology based on laser displacement sensor in fault diagnosis of spur gear of rotation vector reducer Aiming at the problem of a spur gear fault of the rotation vector (RV) reducer in industrial robots, an instantaneous phase detection technology based on eccentric modulation and laser displacement sensor is proposed. Taking the RV-20E reducer as the object, through the analysis of the RV reducer gear fault mechanism, an RV reducer fault diagnosis test bed is developed to simulate the actual operating conditions of the RV reducer of industrial robot. The instantaneous phase information of the RV reducer is collected, and the adaptive permutation entropy is used to process the instantaneous phase data, which can judge the gear fault type quickly and effectively.

"Remaining useful life prediction with uncertainty quantification for rotating machinery: A method based on explainable variational deep gaussian process Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction is one of the key technologies to ensure the safety and reliability of mechanical equipment. To address the challenges of low prediction accuracy and insufficient uncertainty quantification in rotating machinery monitoring, this paper proposes an innovative Variational Deep Gaussian Process (VDGP) method. The proposed method adopts an Adaptive Inter-layer Variational Inference (AIVI) strategy, integrating inter-layer dependency modeling, adaptive inducing point optimization, and hierarchical variational lower bound, enhancing information transfer and feature extraction in multi-layer structures while reducing redundant computation and improving training efficiency. Through Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis and correlation analysis between input features and hidden layer node outputs, the key factors in RUL prediction are deeply explored. The VDGP method is validated using the C-MAPSS dataset and a wind turbine planetary gearbox dataset, and it is thoroughly compared with classical methods and state-of-the-art methods from the past three years. Experimental results show that the VDGP method not only achieves superior prediction accuracy but also effectively quantifies prediction uncertainty. Additionally, through SHAP analysis and correlation analysis between input features and hidden layer node outputs, low-contribution features are identified and removed, significantly reducing the number of required sensors and deployment costs. This improves computational efficiency and real-time performance, providing strong technical support for equipment health evaluation, sensor deployment optimization in industrial applications, cost reduction, and enhanced real-time monitoring and decision-making efficiency. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",2-s2.0-105002632934

"Fault detection of cylindrical lithium-ion battery under Markov switching Fault detecting is crucial for the safety of the lithium-ion battery. This is because thermal fault and sensor fault are the most common fault in battery, and it may be catastrophic. This study explores a novel fault detection scheme for the cylindrical lithium-ion battery. In this scheme, for the modeling simplicity and physical realism, an electrothermal model is adopted to describe the cell’s thermal behaviors. Specifically, based on the uncertainties and mode switching, this scheme proposed an interval filter to estimate the surface temperature of cell. Furthermore, upper and lower bounds of surface temperature estimates are established using interval filters and information of uncertainty. In addition, an effective method based on L∞ norm is proposed to measure the effect of uncertainty.

"Generalized fault diagnosis method of transmission lines using transfer learning technique Recent artificial intelligence-based methods have shown great promise in the use of neural networks for real-time detection of transmission line faults and estimation of their locations. The expansion of power systems including transmission lines with various lengths have made the fault detection, classification, and location estimation process more challenging. Transmission line datasets are stream data which are continuously collected by various sensors and hence, require generalized and fast fault diagnosis approaches. Newly collected datasets including voltages and currents for faulty and non-faulty situations might not have adequate and accurate labels that are useful to train neural networks. In this paper, a novel transfer learning framework based on a pre-trained LeNet-5 convolutional neural network is proposed. This method is able to diagnose faults for different transmission line lengths and impedances by transferring the knowledge from a source convolutional neural network to predict a dissimilar target dataset. By transferring this knowledge, faults from various transmission lines, even without sufficient data samples with labels, can be diagnosed faster and more efficiently than the existing methods. To prove the feasibility and effectiveness of this methodology, seven different datasets that include various lengths of transmission lines are used. The robustness of the proposed methodology against the generator voltage fluctuations, variations in fault locations, fault inception angle, fault resistance, and phase difference between the two generators are well studied to prove the reliability of this technique for fault diagnosis of transmission lines. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2-s2.0-85131408844
"Digital Pipeline Network, Feasibility of Data Acquisition at Offshore Brownfield Recently digital pipeline system has been introduced, advocating the advantages on the simplification of pipeline monitoring, elimination of inspection activities as well as the accessibility of information especially on the wellness of the pipeline(s). For successful implementation of digital pipeline system, availability of Internet of things (IoT); which is the network of physical objects ""things"" that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the Internet, is a must. The problems is IoT is rare or even non-existence for pipelines that have been there before 2005. Despite there are many oil and gas operators who have well advanced in control and monitoring their offshore facilities, they mostly monitor the only pressures and shutdown system. Other than that existing equipment in offshore facilities are often analogue and disconnected. A study on data retrieval feasibility to provide information to develop digital pipeline network for brown field facility arrived with very costly equipment installation. This is due the absent off communication system (DCS) and online measuring equipment (such as flow meter, pressure gauge and temperature sensor) at the required location of many offshore facility. This paper will discuss the feasibility and urgency of implementing of Digital Pipeline Network in offshore facilities most importantly at the existing and aging facilities. It will put across the importance of data retrieval, the required additional equipment and the facility for communication system as well as the assessment of installation hurdles at the aging facilities and the consequential cost requirement. Comprehensive data retrieval at brown field facilities can be achieved through rationalization between automated digital data online reading by installation of wireless IoT system (for equipment to measure pressure, flowrate and temperature) complimented with the existing communication system, manual data retrieval by site visit and network software analysis in order to reduce the material and installation cost while keeping the objectives intact. Pipeline OPEX will be subsequently reduced once AI based technology such as predictive and prescriptive assessment for effective pipeline monitoring and integrity management can be implemented and hence inspection and maintenance program for pipeline(s) can be optimized.

"A non-contacting leak fault diagnosis method for subsea Christmas tree valve based on deep neural network with skip connections Due to the complex and diverse underwater environment, underwater acoustic transmission is easily disturbed, absorbing many noise components. To deal with the complex noise components is a challenge with the traditional signal processing method. Moreover, it is hard to diagnose the valve's leakage and the leakage degree in the subsea Christmas tree using underwater acoustic signals. This paper proposes a new non-contacting fault diagnosis method based on a deep neural network (DNN) with skip connections. First, we obtain the required time-domain data using acoustic sensors (a digital hydrophone) in experiments. Second, the time-domain data is preprocessed and is converted by the short-time Fourier transform into time-frequency domain signals. The time-frequency domain signals are then input into a constructed DNN model to minimize the noise components in the signal. After that, the denoised data are applied to a convolutional neural network for fault diagnosis. Finally, an underwater acoustic experiment is designed and performed to validate the proposed method's effectiveness. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively diagnose the leakage fault of the valve, and the diagnosis accuracy reaches 98.89%. © 2022",2-s2.0-85145600083

"Bearing fault diagnosis via fusing small samples and training multi-state Siamese neural networks Recently, deep learning techniques have been widely applied to fault diagnosis due to their outstanding feature extraction abilities. The success of deep-learning-based fault diagnosis methods is highly dependent on the quantity and quality of the training data. In practical scenarios, it is challenging to obtain sufficient high-quality training data for fault diagnosis tasks due to complex environments, which would affect the effectiveness of the deep learning methods. In this paper, a new fault diagnosis method is proposed for motor bearing fault diagnosis under small samples. The Siamese neural networks (SNNs) are employed to extract the fault features. A multi-stage training strategy is proposed to train the SNNs with the aim to prevent the training stagnation problem and handle the small sample problem. A multi-source feature fusion network is developed to make full use of the multi-source sensor data by fusing the extracted fault features for further fault diagnosis.

"An intelligent fault node diagnosis and classification approach using XGBoost with whale optimization in wireless sensor networks The failure of sensor nodes in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) will have a significant impact on network reliability, quality and its lifetime. Faulty sensor nodes in WSN cause various issues, such as network topology changes, partitioning of the network, failures in communication paths, and data transmission. In order to enhance the longevity and performance of the network, quality and reliability of WSN, there is a need for timely diagnose and classify faults in sensor nodes in the network. In this paper, an Enhanced Extreme Gradient Boosting (EXGB) optimized with Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) has been proposed for efficient fault diagnosis and classification in WSN. The proposed fault diagnosis approach is divided into three phases: (i) collection of sensor data (ii) fault node diagnosis and (iii) fault node classification. The proposed system EXGB optimized with WOA is employed to diagnose a faulty node in the second phase. Moreover, EXGB optimized with WOA can improve the network’s speed of learning and it is used to identify the cause of the fault in the network, and the necessary actions are taken to recover the fault and restore the network. The MATLAB simulator and Python are utilized for the implementation of the proposed protocol presented in this study. The experimental result shows that the EXGB protocol produces better fault diagnosis accuracy, classification accuracy, expands network lifetime by 5 to 12% and minimizes the diagnosis latency by 7 to 12% when comparing with its counterparts. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",2-s2.0-85212097095
"Early fault detection in thermocouples used in nuclear power plants using decomposition based signal processing method Nuclear facilities—including power reactors, research units, and fuel processing plants—depend on Instrumentation and Control (I&C) systems with various sensors to continuously monitor critical parameters, especially temperature. Reliable data from temperature sensors is essential for maintaining operational safety and efficiency. Mineral Insulated Metal Sheath (MIMS) Thermocouples (TCs) are widely used due to their mechanical durability and thermal stability. However, prolonged exposure to corrosive and high-stress reactor environments can degrade the sheath, compromising sensor performance and measurement accuracy. In such conditions, fractured sheaths often generate non-stationary and irregular signals, reducing the effectiveness of conventional fault detection and feature extraction methods and increasing the risk of undetected failures. Effective early fault detection is essential to prevent measurement inaccuracies, minimize system downtime, and ensure reliable operation in the above said critical applications. In the present work, an early fault detection strategy for TCs using signal decomposition method is presented. K-type TCs were exposed to various concentrations of acid medium and their response was recorded in real time. Various signal decomposition methods (Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), and Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT)) were applied on the recorded signal, and six statistical features were extracted from both the time domain and the decomposed signal coefficients. The Mann-Whitney U test was utilized to evaluate and correlate the extracted features across reference and faulty TC responses. Results demonstrate that standard deviation, variance, and energy outperform other statistical metrics in detecting early TC degradation. The analysis reveals that EMD is better suited for TC fault detection as compared to EWT and DWT, demonstrating its potential to enhance the reliability and safety of nuclear power plant operations. Finally, results obtained in the present work are compared with various experimental studies reported in the literature on fault detection methods. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",2-s2.0-105010956966
"Fault diagnosis for ion mill etching machine cooling system based on omni-dimensional dynamic convolution and dynamic spatial pyramid pooling Ion mill etching machine is a critical equipment in semiconductor manufacturing for wafer etching processes. The cooling system, as an integral part of the Ion mill etching machine, is prone to malfunctions during operation, which can result in the scrapping of subsequent wafers processed by the equipment. Therefore, early detection of cooling system faults is crucial to prevent wafer wastage. Due to the high flexibility of the processing process in ion beam etching machines, the length of time-series signals collected by sensors varies significantly, which poses a challenge for accurate fault diagnosis of the cooling system in ion mill etching machines. To address these issues, we propose a novel end-to-end hybrid model called ODCNN-DSPP. The main contributions are as follows: (1) Enhancing the convolutional neural network (CNN) model structure by introducing an omni-dimensional dynamic convolutional layer to improve feature extraction capabilities; and (2) Utilising a dynamic spatial pyramid pooling method to mitigate the impact of irrelevant features on the CNN. Using publicly available ion mill etching machine datasets for experiments, the results indicate that the method proposed in this paper outperforms current mainstream fault diagnosis methods, achieving an average fault diagnosis accuracy of 96.55% on the test set. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2-s2.0-85216282822

"Cyber-resilience for marine navigation by information fusion and change detection Cyber-resilience is an increasing concern for autonomous navigation of marine vessels. This paper scrutinizes cyber-resilience properties of marine navigation through a prism with three edges: multiple sensor information fusion, diagnosis of not-normal behaviours, and change detection. It proposes a two-stage estimator for diagnosis and mitigation of sensor signals used for coastal navigation. Developing a Likelihood Field approach, the first stage extracts shoreline features from radar and matches them to the electronic navigation chart. The second stage associates buoy and beacon features from the radar with chart information. Using real data logged at sea tests combined with simulated spoofing, the paper verifies the ability to timely diagnose and isolate an attempt to compromise position measurements. A new approach is suggested for high level processing of received data to evaluate their consistency, which is agnostic to the underlying technology of the individual sensory input. A combined generalized likelihood ratio test using both parametric Gaussian modelling and Kernel Density Estimation is suggested and compared with a detector using only either of two. The paper shows how the detection of deviations from nominal behaviour is possible when the navigation sensor is under attack or defects occur. © 2022 The Authors",2-s2.0-85140991226

The aim of the initiatives is basically to improve the efficiency of critical processes thus at the end will reduce overall cost and improve production margin and revenue/profitability. This paper will present the initiative of PETRONAS' Pipeline fraternity consisting of pipeline experts, managers and engineers in the development of intelligent and integrated pipeline integrity management system. The system is designed to have minimal people intervention as data will be automatically uploaded by Inspection & Maintenance (I & M) vendors and field technicians through interface software and utilising artificial intelligence/ machine learning for descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics. It is envisaged that by having the system, critical decision-making pertaining to integrity, safety and reliability of pipeline system could be done in ‘split seconds’ extending the asset's life and eliminating unwanted incidents i.e. leak/rupture. Furthermore, standardisation of pipeline risk and integrity software/tools among Operating PETRONAS Units (OPU)/regions will provide cost savings in the long term compared to current practice of having off-the-shelf software/tools. Integration of relevant corporate software/tools and the intended software/ tools will further provide cost savings in terms of database management and enhanced efficiency.

"Mix-VAEs: A novel multisensor information fusion model for intelligent fault diagnosis Multisensor information are usually required to recognize the health condition of machinery by domain experts, since redundancy and complementarity of multisensor information can enhance robustness of fault diagnosis. However, the mainstream approaches of intelligent fault diagnosis based on deep neural networks only focus on applications of single sensor. In this paper, a novel intelligent fault diagnosis model using mixture of Gaussians (MoGs) and variational auto-encoders (VAEs), named Mix-VAEs, is proposed to leverage redundancy and complementarity of multisensor information. The proposed Mix-VAEs mainly contains two modules. First, feature extracting module is constructed by several parallel and independent VAEs which are used to learn data representation from multisensor data respectively, and their latent variable distributions extracted by VAEs are used for fusion. Second, in multisensor information fusion module, a novel fusion method is proposed where latent variable distributions are combined to form MoGs, and the fused features are obtained in a sampling manner from MoGs.

"Intelligent fault detection algorithm based on Hi/H∞ optimization and a cascaded neural networks Autonomous surface ships (ASSs) have attracted attention owing to their ability to perform various tasks in complex and challenging aquatic environments without relying on a crew. However, they require reliable sensors to ensure navigational safety. In this study, a robust and intelligent fault detection algorithm was designed for the integrated navigation system of an ASS. First, a residual observer-based fault detection algorithm using Hi/H∞ optimization is proposed to deal with process disturbances and measurement noise. Such noise can be modeled under the condition of a bounded l2-norm to account for the sensitivity and robustness of the residual observer against random noise with unknown properties. However, this fault detection algorithm is insensitive to soft faults, which manifest as noise characterized by a small amplitude and slow variation. Conventional strategies for evaluating the fault detection threshold rely on human experience, which is insufficiently sophisticated for fault detection. Therefore, a cascaded neural network is proposed for optimizing the fault detection algorithm when the amount of training data is limited. The cascaded neural network consists of a multi-feature time domain network, a frequency-domain fault detection network as well as a decision-level fusion network. The proposed algorithm was verified in simulations as well as on historical data collected from real ship sensors. The results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm offers intelligent fault detection, including soft faults, with a low false alarm rate for integrated navigation systems. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85147456769
"A deep learning-based CNN-GRU prediction model for early fault diagnosis in rolling ball bearings Rolling ball bearings are the essential components of rotating machines that can be affected by various faults, increasing the maintenance costs and downtime of the machine. The paper introduces a novel CNN-GRU prediction model, aimed to detect and diagnose incipient faults in the ball bearings components. The model is learned on nonlinear vibration signals that were recorded from a laboratory experimental setup performed on Machine Fault Simulator (MFS), focusing on defects in the inner race (IR), outer race (OR) and composite faults (CF). By leveraging deep features extracted through neural networks and employing transfer learning with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network, the study enhances classification accuracy and effectively resolves the problem of vanishing gradient problem. The GRU has the advantage of efficiently extracting temporal features which have a long-term dependency in the time-series data, while the CNN captures both local and global spatial features. This combined approach not only enhances fault detection accuracy but also reduces the computational burden on the classifier. Overall, the result of this paper introduces a promising approach for both efficient and accurate fault detection and severity estimation in bearings of induction motors, potentially reducing the need for extensive manpower and sensor usage. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025.",2-s2.0-105007560035
"A two-stage importance-aware subgraph convolutional network based on multi-source sensors for cross-domain fault diagnosis Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) as the emerging neural networks have shown great success in Prognostics and Health Management because they can not only extract node features but can also mine relationship between nodes in the graph data. However, the most existing GCNs-based methods are still limited by graph quality, variable working conditions, and limited data, making them difficult to obtain remarkable performance. Therefore, it is proposed in this paper a two stage importance-aware subgraph convolutional network based on multi-source sensors named I2SGCN to address the above-mentioned limitations. In the real-world scenarios, it is found that the diagnostic performance of the most existing GCNs is commonly bounded by the graph quality because it is hard to get high quality through a single sensor. Therefore, we leveraged multi-source sensors to construct graphs that contain more fault-based information of mechanical equipment. Then, we discovered that unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods only use single stage to achieve cross-domain fault diagnosis and ignore more refined feature extraction, which can make the representations contained in the features inadequate. Hence, it is proposed the two-stage fault diagnosis in the whole framework to achieve UDA. In the first stage, the multiple-instance learning is adopted to obtain the importance factor of each sensor towards preliminary fault diagnosis. In the second stage, it is proposed I2SGCN to achieve refined cross-domain fault diagnosis. Moreover, we observed that deficient and limited data may cause label bias and biased training, leading to reduced generalization capacity of the proposed method. Therefore, we constructed the feature-based graph and importance-based graph to jointly mine more effective relationship and then presented a subgraph learning strategy, which not only enriches sufficient and complementary features but also regularizes the training. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four case studies demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method for cross-domain fault diagnosis, which outperforms the state-of-the art methods. © 2024 The Author(s)",2-s2.0-85199723605
"Nonfragile H∞ fault detection for fuzzy discrete systems under stochastic communication protocol In this article, considering one type of fuzzy discrete-time networked control systems (NCSs) under stochastic communication protocol (SCP), a fuzzy-based nonfragile H∞ filter is developed to detect the subsistent fault signal. The Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) mathematical model is employed to approximate the nonlinearities in the concerned fuzzy NCSs. The SCP is adopted to decide which sensor gets the access to the communication network at certain time instant, and the scheduling model of which is constructed as a Markov chain. Taking into account that the filter gain parameters in real practice may suffer fluctuations during the implementation, a modified nonfragile fuzzy filter is designed to detect the fault occurred in the signal transmission. By using the strong centralized stochastic analysis technique and the matrix calculation method, a Lyapunov function is adopted to derive sufficient conditions under which the filtering error dynamics is stochastically stable and the H∞ performance is satisfied. Then, the desired nonfragile fuzzy fault detection filter is realized by solving a certain linear matrix inequality.

Pressure variations in the pipeline network may result in changes of the feature distribution of the valve leakage acoustic emission (AE) signals, which makes it challenging for traditional data-driven detection models to achieve satisfactory generalization performance. Unfortunately, there has been limited attention in the current literature on multi-sensor cross-domain fault diagnosis for the ship pipeline valves. To address this research gap, this study aims to develop a novel multi-sensor cross-domain fault diagnosis method. Firstly, the time-frequency-multisqueezing transform (TFMST) is employed for time-frequency analysis of the valve leakage AE signals. By accurately describing harmonic and pulse components in the AE signals, the time-frequency domain features of the valve leakage can be extracted. Subsequently, a multi-sensor deep transfer learning model based on multi-channel fusion convolutional neural network (MCFCNN) is proposed, which utilizes the domain adaptation strategy to minimize the maximum mean discrepancy between source domain data and target domain data, significantly improving the robustness of the fault detection to variations of operating environments. Experimental testing has been carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, and the results indicate effective valve leakage detection. © 2024",2-s2.0-85186330081
"Portable ppb-level acetylene photoacoustic sensor for transformer on-field measurement Acetylene (C2H2) is considered as one of the typical decomposition gas of transformer oil to measure the severity of oil-immersed transformer fault. Quantitative measurement of trace C2H2, especially on-field measurement, has long been the center of fault diagnosis field. In this work, a ppb-level photoacoustic sensor for C2H2 was developed for transformer insulation status detection. Firstly, combined degassing method was employed to extract dissolved gas from oil. According to known Ostwald coefficient at certain temperature, the concentration of dissolved C2H2 in oil can be calculated by measuring the concentration of extracted C2H2. Then, a quantitative detection system for C2H2 based on laser photoacoustic spectroscopy was established in this work. The concentration of the extracted C2H2 can be reversed by obtained photoacoustic signal. Experimental results indicate that the detection limit of proposed system can reach ~3.4 ppb. Besides, compared with the quantitative detection results of GC, the relative error of proposed sensor could meet relevant requirements. Experimental fruitions testify the feasibility of proposed sensor for field application, and the results of this work may serve as a guide of insulation fault diagnosis for oil-immersed transformer. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH",2-s2.0-85108602682
"Leveraging deep learning techniques for ship pipeline valve leak monitoring The monitoring of ship pipeline valve leaks holds immense significance as it serves to enhance ship safety, mitigate energy and material losses, and protect the health and sustainability of the marine environment. In comparison to traditional expert-based fault diagnosis methods, this study presents a deep learning-based fault feature extraction approach for end-to-end valve leak fault diagnosis. To address the challenge of incomplete leak fault description by a single sensor, a Multi-Channel Multi-Scale Convolutional Neural Network (MCMS-CNN) model is established. Diverging from existing methods, the proposed MCMS-CNN model automatically extracts fault features from grayscale images obtained from two sensors and performs feature-level fusion for fault classification, thereby mitigating the impact of data redundancy and noise and enhancing fault recognition accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified through valve leak experiments, and comparisons are conducted with different models and information fusion methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed MCMS-CNN model exhibits advantages in terms of accuracy and robustness, confirming its practicality in ship pipeline valve leak fault diagnosis. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85174684972
"Line laser based sensor for real-time seed counting and seed miss detection for precision planter Modern agriculture is heavily reliant on precision agriculture. To ensure the uniformity of seeding, inexpensive, and easy-to-use seed counting sensors are required. The information from those sensors must be easily available, transferable, and interpretable while the sensor should be simple, robust, and cheap. This paper described the development and testing of a new line laser based seed counting sensor for use with seed metering devices. The proposed sensor could scan the area (instead of a line) at the release point of the seed metering device. It formed a scanning area using a line laser and 7 phototransistors. The sensor had a HIGH voltage signal level raising time of about 500 ns and did not require additional signal or image processing software. The signal from the phototransistor was combined through the NAND gate and transferred to an Android device. All components used in the sensor were cheap and reliable. The sensor can be used in precision seeders for reliable real-time seed monitoring and fault detection. © 2023",2-s2.0-85163425301
"HxPINN: A hypernetwork-based physics-informed neural network for real-time monitoring of an industrial heat exchanger The importance of heat exchangers in achieving sustainability goals has significantly increased across industries, given their crucial role in maintaining energy efficiency. However, lack of effective monitoring hardware for industrial heat exchangers often leads to suboptimal performance and unplanned stoppages. Physics-based numerical solvers, while accurate, are often computationally intensive and require frequent adjustments for monitoring. On the other hand, machine learning or data-driven models face a stiff challenge as they rely exclusively on data which is scarce due to lack of sensors. We present HxPINN, a hypernetwork-based physics-informed neural network (PINN) model for real-time monitoring of an industrial heat exchanger. Our approach incorporates a hypernetwork-based framework, enhancing a domain-decomposed PINN to learn the heat exchanger’s thermal behavior under dynamic operating conditions. HxPINN minimizes the need for retraining PINNs for different operating conditions and significantly reduces the inference time compared to existing approaches, without significant loss of accuracy vis-à-vis physics-based simulations. The methodology was tested on an Air Preheater (APH), a regenerative heat exchanger used in thermal power plants. The mean absolute error in APH internal temperatures with HxPINN when compared with benchmark physics-based simulation was found to be well below 5 °C across all the operating conditions. HxPINN has also accelerated the inference by up to 35–40x compared to existing approaches including transfer learnt PINNs and physics-based numerical solution. The methodology holds great potential for predictive maintenance of industrial equipment using digital twin systems providing efficient, adaptable, and real-time monitoring capabilities. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2-s2.0-105003421499

"Simultaneous methane and acetylene detection using frequency-division multiplexed laser absorption spectroscopy A dual-gas optical sensor was developed using frequency-division multiplexed (FDM) scanned-wavelength modulation spectroscopy for simultaneous detection of methane (CH4) and acetylene (C2H2). Two infrared lasers were combined to exploit C2H2 and CH4 absorption lines centered at 6539.45 cm−1 and 6057.09 cm−1, respectively. Scanned-WMS with the second-harmonic detection (WMS-2f) and a compact astigmatic multipass gas cell (36-m path length in a 0.3 L volume) were employed to improve detection sensitivity. Simultaneous dual-gas detection was realized by modulating each laser at a different frequency (5 kHz for 1529 nm and 13 kHz for 1650 nm) and software lock-in amplifiers were used to obtain the corresponding WMS-2f signals from a single photodetector. The Allan deviation analysis was performed to assess the long-term stability and minimum detection limit (MDL) of the sensor system. The MDL of 0.92 ppm for CH4 and 0.64 ppm for C2H2 was achieved at 0.02-s integration time, which can be further improved to 55 ppb for CH4 and 10 ppb for C2H2 at an optimum integration time of 10-s and 15-s, respectively. Such a dual-gas sensor has a promising potential for detecting dissolved gases (CH4 and C2H2) in transformer oil for fault diagnosis due to its high sensitivity, hardware simplicity, and fast temporal resolution. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85133927591
"An intelligent sailfish optimization based fault diagnosis and classification in wireless sensor networks Wireless sensor networks (WSN) are becoming increasingly popular due to the growth of a number of emergent technologies like the Internet of Things. Tiny, interconnected sensors, forming WSN, however, these networks are vulnerable to sensor node failures caused by harsh environments, unreliable hardware, and communication module. To prevent further degradation of service in the network and ensure reliability and performance of WSN, we need an efficient mechanism to handle node failures. In this context, an efficient fault diagnosis and classification approach is proposed by utilizing the Least Square Twin Support Vector Machine (LS-TwinSVM) and the Improved Sailfish Optimization (ISFO) algorithm. It utilizes a two-step approach: first, an algorithm efficiently identifies nodes experiencing hard faults. The second step employs a separate algorithm to diagnose and classify the specific types of faults, such as normal nodes or transient, intermittent and permanent faulty nodes, by utilizing LS-TwinSVM optimized with ISFO. The simulation is carried out using MATLAB for analyzing the performance of the proposed framework with various performance metrics, namely diagnosis accuracy, false positive rate, classification accuracy, energy consumption and delay. The validity of the proposed protocol has been verified through comparisons with the PBRB, BPNN, LSTM, and DBN. From the analysis carried out with the benchmark dataset, it is apparent that the proposed framework achieves a high diagnosis accuracy of 97.14%, and classification accuracy of 95.65% with less false positive rate and utilizes minimum energy compared to its counterparts. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",2-s2.0-85211384530

"Impulsive method to reliable sampled-data control for uncertain fractional-order memristive neural networks with stochastic sensor faults and its applications This paper is devoted to investigate the issue of fault-tolerant sampled-data control for a class of uncertain fractional-order memristive neural networks with random switching topologies subject to stochastic sensor faults via impulsive method. Firstly, a fault detection sampled-data control strategy is proposed for sensor failure. Then, by utilizing the constructed quasi-periodic polynomial Lyapunov function, the criterion for ensuring that the transformed pulse system achieves asymptotic stability is established. Moreover, based on this criterion and with the help of the mechanism of sum of squares (SSs), the desired reliable control gain matrix is obtained. Finally, a numerical example is employed to demonstrate the validity of our method, and this method is applied to the well-known fractional-order Chua’s circuit system. Compared to large quantities of results for integer-order memristive neural networks, only a small number of results are for fractional order. In particular, the sampling-controlled fractional-order memristive neural networks have not been solved until now, let alone the novel impulive approach designed in this paper.

"A new method for intelligent fault diagnosis of machines based on unsupervised domain adaptation Data driven fault diagnosis has attracted a lot of attention in recent years owing to its intelligent and accurate detection of fault categories. However, it is a challenge for its applications in real world. The abundant labeled data is extremely necessary for data driven fault diagnosis to train a favorable model. Even though enough labeled data is prepared for training a model, we still cannot ensure the data used for training and testing draw from identical distribution. In other words, the labeled source domain has different distribution compared with the unlabeled target domain. In this paper, we introduce the domain adaptation strategy into deep neural networks to propose a deep domain adaptation architecture, which realizes to learn knowledge from the labeled source domain to facilitate the target classification. In the proposed model, the conditional and marginal distribution are adapted together in multiple layers of neural network, which uses MMD to measure the distribution discrepancy. Besides, the relative importance between marginal and conditional distributions is explored, and an adaptively weighted strategy is further introduced to learn the relative importance of the two distributions. To evaluate the proposed method, we conduct the simulations on different workloads, sensor deployment locations, and even different platforms. The results show the superiority of the proposed model to other intelligent fault diagnosis methods, meanwhile verify the necessity of marginal and conditional distribution adaptation and adaptive weighted strategy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",2-s2.0-85097714683
"Graph attention Network-Based model for multiple fault detection and identification of sensors in nuclear power plant The accuracy of sensor's measurements is critical for the normal operation of nuclear power plants. However, the harsh operating environment of nuclear power plants increases the probability of sensor failure. Therefore, it is necessary to detect and identify the fault of sensors in time. This paper proposes a fault detection model based on graph attention network, which is called ALPHA-GAT, to solve multiple fault detection and identification of sensors in the primary coolant loop of a nuclear power plant. ALPHA-GAT first uses GAT to obtain the correlation matrices of sensors, and the correlation matrices are fed into an adversarial autoencoder for reconstruction. The node features of the GAT are parallelly fed into a long short-term memory network to predict the ground truth of sensors. Subsequently, the anomaly score which is used for fault detection and identification, is calculated based on reconstruction error and prediction error. A strategy based on fault decoupling to identify multi-sensor faults has also been proposed, which replaces the data of fault sensor with the prediction of the model. This strategy effectively alleviates the negative impact of fault data on subsequent diagnosis. Finally, the data from a simulation model of a nuclear power plant is used to verify the efficiency of the proposed model. The results of experiments indicate that ALPHA-GAT effectively improves the accuracy and timeliness of multi-sensor fault detection and identification. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",2-s2.0-85184058874

"Innovative digital twin with artificial neural networks for real-time monitoring of structural response: A port structure case study Port structures face the constant threat of deterioration due to exposure to dynamic and seismic forces, as well as harsh environmental condition prevalent in a maritime setting. These challenges lead to induced stress concentrations within the structures, resulting in potential catastrophic failures. Despite significant effort, expenses, and time consumption associated with traditional structural health monitoring systems (SHM), regular inspections remain the norm. This study introduces innovative methods to replace traditional approaches, leveraging Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) as surrogates for real-time finite element (FE) modelling. The goal is to develop FE-based real-time digital twins for port structure by using sensor data, visualizing structural behaviour, and enabling a comprehensive monitoring of its structural response. An ANN model is trained using a validated FE model of the structure, generating immediate deformations based on sensor readings. By implementing this approach, stress variations are efficiently obtained and visualized throughout the structure. Unlike traditional methods that follow an inverse approach in estimating the entire structural response based on sensor values, the ANNs demonstrate high efficiency in addressing ill-conditioning issues inherent in such processes. This integrated methodology showcases the effectiveness of ANNs in providing real-time insights into the structural response of port infrastructure, offering a viable addition to the conventional SHM practices. The trained ANN model generates results in a high accuracy where the testing error is in the order of 10−5 and it generates data within 15 milli seconds demonstrating the near real-time conditions. The development of digital twins, facilitated by ANNs, demonstrates a promising solution for continuous monitoring, predictive maintenance, and risk mitigation in the face of dynamic operational and environmental challenges.

"In-network generalized trustworthy data collection for event detection in cyber-physical systems Sensors in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are typically used to collect various aspects of the region of interest and transmit the data towards upstream nodes for further processing. However, data collection in CPS is often unreliable due to severe resource constraints (e.g., bandwidth and energy), environmental impacts (e.g., equipment faults and noises), and security concerns. Besides, detecting an event through the aggregation in CPS can be intricate and untrustworthy if the sensor’s data is not validated during data acquisition, before transmission, and before aggregation. This paper introduces In-network Generalized Trustworthy Data Collection (IGTDC) framework for event detection in CPS. This framework facilitates reliable data for aggregation at the edge of CPS. The main idea of IGTDC is to enable a sensor’s module to examine locally whether the event’s acquired data is trustworthy before transmitting towards the upstream nodes. It further validates whether the received data can be trusted or not before data aggregation at the sink node. Additionally, IGTDC helps to identify faulty sensors. For reliable event detection, we use collaborative IoT tactics, gate-level modeling with Verilog User Defined Primitive (UDP), and Programmable Logic Device (PLD) to ensure that the event’s acquired data is reliable before transmitting towards the upstream nodes. We employ Gray code in gate-level modeling. It helps to ensure that the received data is reliable. Gray code also helps to distinguish a faulty sensor. Through simulation and extensive performance analysis, we demonstrate that the collected data in the IGTDC framework is reliable and can be used in the majority of CPS applications.

"Joint model for residual life estimation based on Long-Short Term Memory network With the rapid development of industrial internet of things, multi-sensor technology has been widely used in system condition monitoring and residual useful life (RUL) estimation, which plays a crucial role in preventing catastrophic failures and reducing maintenance losses. However, current prognosis using multi-sensor data faces the following challenges: (i) Manual feature selection and extraction and exploration of degradation failure mechanism for a complex domain require a substantial amount of human labor and expertise from the practitioner, which is seldom available. (ii) Data fusion and prognosis are usually divided into two separate steps, resulting in the lack of intrinsic relationship between the two tasks. (iii) The end-to-end prediction methods directly based on deep learning behave like the black-box and provide no information for degradation progression. To overcome these drawbacks, a prediction framework comprising two deep learning models is proposed in this paper. Through the proposed supervised joint training scheme, the framework not only provides a continuous visualization progression of system degradation but also ensures that the generated fusion signal effectively performs in RUL prediction. As a framework application, a joint model of RUL estimation based on an ordinary long short-term memory network is designed.

It is important to note that relying on a single method for calculating lifetime usage is inadequate.

"A vibration sensor based on Sagnac interferometer and fiber ring laser for fault diagnosis of bearing A vibration sensor based on Sagnac interferometer and fiber ring laser (FRL) is proposed for fault diagnosis of bearing, and a sensing system of vibration is demonstrated experimentally. In the sensing system, the Sagnac interferometer based on single mode fiber- polarization maintaining fiber-single mode fiber (SPS) as a sensor is connected to FRL which performs as a filter. Because the transmission characteristics of the SPS is modulated by strain, intensity-modulated sensing is induced for output power of the FRL. Experimental result shows that the accurate frequency of the vibration signal within relative error of 1.0% can be obtained by the sensor. The proposed sensor has the advantages of low-cost, compact size, easy to be fabricated and excellent anti-interference ability, which has potential applications on the bearing fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",2-s2.0-85104381909
"Time-frequency synchronisation contrastive learning-driven multi-sensor remaining useful life prediction Deep learning techniques play a crucial role in predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of mechanical equipment. Nevertheless, obtaining a substantial number of labeled samples is a challenge, and the prediction accuracy tends to decline when the labeled samples are insufficient. Moreover, existing RUL prediction methods usually extract the degradation characteristics only from one single domain, which is insufficient for a high-accuracy prediction. To address these challenges, a time-frequency synchronization contrastive learning-driven (TFSCL) multi-sensor remaining useful life prediction model is proposed. The proposed TFSCL utilizes a large amount of unlabeled data for model pre-training and key feature extraction, and it introduces a novel time-frequency fusion contrastive loss function to optimize the pre-training process. It employs a dual-channel structure at the sensor and timestamp levels, incorporating an attention mechanism that adaptively adjusts sensor feature weights, enabling more accurate extraction of critical information while effectively mitigating interference from irrelevant data. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed TFSCL, two case studies are conducted, with different labeling ratios being used. The experimental results demonstrate that even with lower labeling ratios, the proposed TFSCL model still achieves a satisfactory prediction effect and outperforms other advanced methods. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2-s2.0-85214277937
"Research on compound fault diagnosis of rolling bearing based on intrinsic time scale decomposition and information fusion In view of the difficulty to effectively extract compound faults of rolling bearing from aero-engine and precisely identify their types, the paper has proposed a method integrating signal separation algorithm and information fusion. Firstly, the method decomposes the vibration acceleration signals collected by sensors from different positions at the same moment based on intrinsic time scale decomposition algorithm.

"A method for identifying the health state of IGBTs based on CEEMDAN and ADP Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs) are core components in electric energy conversion systems, and monitoring their health is essential for ensuring reliable operation. Turn-off stress wave signals emitted by IGBTs can be detected using acoustic emission (AE) sensors, offering a non-invasive means to assess device condition. In this study, we present a comprehensive framework that integrates complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN), asymmetric dot pattern (ADP) conversion, and a residual network (ResNet) for accurate health-state identification.First, stress wave signals are decomposed into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) via CEEMDAN. Next, IMFs with the highest energy contributions and the most distinct correlation differences are selected to emphasize fault-relevant features. Selected IMFs are then transformed into two-dimensional ADP images that capture signal dynamics and subtle variations across different health states. Finally, a ResNet classifier is trained on these images to categorize multiple IGBT health conditions.Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves over 98 % classification accuracy—significantly outperforming traditional feature-based and shallow learning approaches. Moreover, it exhibits strong noise robustness and computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time monitoring.

"Fault detection and identification for control systems in floating offshore wind farms: A supervised Deep Learning methodology This study employs a data-driven Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) methodology in Floating Offshore Wind Turbine (FOWT) farms. The main objective of the work lies in classifying faults impacting the components of the control subsystems across multiple turbines. Unlike existing research, the emphasis here is placed specifically on identifying and classifying non-critical faults, which may result in suboptimal farm performance without necessitating a shutdown. From a methodological perspective, a Deep Neural Network has been designed to solve the classification problem by providing a probability vector, the most probable class indicator of the true state. One of the major contributions of this work lies in its applicability to FOWT farms instead of being confined to individual devices, facilitating a comprehensive performance assessment at the global farm level. The integration of this data-driven methodology with tolerant control strategies might enable early intervention, mitigating the impact of these faults and enhancing overall power generation efficiency. The target case study is a three-FOWT farm modeled in a Simulink environment, allowing for the simulation of operational behavior under diverse conditions and various faults affecting sensors and actuators. This work considers ten distinct fault classes, including the healthy condition, and three possible faults for each FOWT: pitch angle sensor, pitch angle actuator, and generator speed sensor. These frequent faults pose challenges to the optimal functioning of the control system managing the FOWTs. The outcomes highlight that the estimated probability of the healthy state serves as a robust indicator for detecting unknown faults. Results also demonstrate the adequate efficacy of the method in pinpointing the fault origin. However, we observe confusion between pitch sensor and actuator faults that require further investigation for comprehensive understanding. © 2024 The Author(s)",2-s2.0-85198526204
"Interfacing PDM MEMS Microphones with PFM Spiking Systems: Application for Neuromorphic Auditory Sensors Neuromorphic computation processes sensors output in the spiking domain, which presents constraints in many cases when converting information to spikes, loosing, as example, temporal accuracy. This paper presents a spike-based system to adapt audio information from low-power pulse-density modulation (PDM) microelectromechanical systems microphones into rate coded spike frequencies. These spikes could be directly used by the neuromorphic auditory sensor (NAS) for frequency decomposition in different bands, avoiding the analog or digital conversion to spike streams. This improves the time response of the NAS, allowing its use in more time restrictive applications. This adaptation was conducted in VHDL as an interface for PDM microphones, converting their pulses into temporal distributed spikes following a pulse-frequency modulation scheme with an accurate inter-spike-interval, known as PDM to spikes interface (PSI). We introduce a new architecture of spike-based band-pass filter to reject DC components and distribute spikes in time. This was tested in two scenarios, first as a stand-alone circuit for its characterization, and then integrated with a NAS for verification. The PSI achieves a total harmonic distortion of - 46.18 dB and a signal-to-noise ratio of 63.47 dB, demands less than 1% of the resources of a Spartan-6 FPGA and its power consumption is around 7 mW. © 2022, The Author(s).",2-s2.0-85134683016
"Detection of ultra-low concentration acetylene gas dissolved in oil based on fiber-optic photoacoustic sensing Dissolved acetylene gas in oil is the characteristic gas to distinguish overheating and discharge faults of transformer. To realize the detection of ultra-low concentration acetylene in transformer oil, a photoacoustic (PA) gas detection system based on ultra-high sensitive fiber-optic acoustic sensing technique was designed. In order to amplify the power of the laser, an Erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) was utilized, thereby increasing the intensity of the PA excitation signal. A cantilever based fiber-optic acoustic sensor was utilized to detect the generated PA signal. the interference of carbon dioxide and water vapor on the detection of ultra-low concentration acetylene was studied through analyzing the absorption spectrum. By optimizing the laser modulation parameters, the interference of the interfering gases on the acetylene absorption signal is reduced.

"Fault-tolerant control for an electro-hydraulic servo system with sensor fault compensation and disturbance rejection The electro-hydraulic servo system (EHSS) usually faces multiple sensor faults and disturbances, which is difficult to achieve good tracking control, reliability, and stability control. In this article, an advanced fault-tolerant controller is proposed for an EHSS to deal with the above challenge. The three fault observers, called nonlinear unknown input observers (NUIOs), are developed to effectively estimate the position, velocity, pressure sensor faults and the system states. The fault detection, estimation, and isolation are then presented as effective for multiple sensors failure at a time. The first NUIO for position sensor fault is utilized for the tracking control, while the other NUIOs are used for alarm proposal. The adverse effects caused by the matched and unmatched disturbances are eliminated by two extended state observers (ESOs). In addition, to avoid the “explosion of complexity” when computing the derivatives of virtual control laws, the dynamic surface control is applied to design the fault-tolerant control (FTC) scheme. The Lyapunov principle ensures system stability under lumped disturbance and faulty conditions. Finally, simulation studies and evaluation results are performed to demonstrate the validity of the proposed FTC algorithm. © 2023, The Author(s).",2-s2.0-85149969569

"Reliable self-healing FBG sensor network for improvement of multipoint strain sensing In this paper, we proposed and designed reliable self-healing fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor network for improvement of multipoint strain sensing. We use an optical switch (OSW) to reconfigure the sensor network and improve the self-healing function during fault happen in the sensor network. In this work, to prove and validate the detection performance of our proposed Bragg wavelength detection technique even when the number of overlap spectra of FBGs increases, we conduct three experiments and collect three different cases of strain data (namely case 1, case 2, and case 3) by applying different strain steps to FBGs. In case 1 experiment, strain was applied to only FBG1 sensor, while the other four FBGs keeps fixed. In case 2 experiment, strain was applied to FBG1 and FBG2 sensors at the same time and with different strain steps. In case 3 experiment, strain was applied to FBG1, FBG2 and FBG3 sensors at the same time and with different strain steps. As a result, in all cases of the experiment, three situations of spectra were introduced between FBGs like non-overlapped, partially overlapped and completely overlapped spectra. To solve this overlap problem, we used deep learning technique to accurately identify the Bragg wavelength of FBGs in the condition of the partially or fully overlapped spectra. Therefore, our proposed FBG sensor system can improve the reliability and detection accuracy of the sensor system even the number of overlaps FBGs spectra increases. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2-s2.0-85110292551
"Structural health monitoring for corrosion induced thickness loss in marine plates subjected to random loads In the highly corrosive environment where marine structures operate, the current industry practice is to overcompensate for corrosion induced thickness loss (CITL) and replace any parts that score below specified allowable limits during scheduled maintenance. Hence, there would be immediate benefits from the implementation of a Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) system that would allow for predictive, condition-based maintenance. The objective of this study is to investigate and assess the effectiveness of state-of-the-art statistical pattern recognition (SPR) and machine learning (ML) methods in association with alternative sensor grid architectures as an SHM scheme for detecting CITL, under highly variable operational conditions. For this purpose, a simple rectangular plate at different corrosion levels (uniform and pitting) was considered as a reference structural element, which was subjected to a stochastic pressure load. Strain response data were produced using Finite Element (FE) simulations and were treated under a probabilistic framework.

"Attention-based sequence to sequence model for machine remaining useful life prediction Accurate estimation of remaining useful life (RUL) of industrial equipment can enable advanced maintenance schedules, increase equipment availability and reduce operational costs. However, existing deep learning methods for RUL prediction are not completely successful due to the following two reasons. First, relying on a single objective function to estimate the RUL will limit the learned representations and thus affect the prediction accuracy. Second, while longer sequences are more informative for modelling the sensor dynamics of equipment, existing methods are less effective to deal with very long sequences, as they mainly focus on the latest information. To address these two problems, we develop a novel attention-based sequence to sequence with auxiliary task (ATS2S) model. In particular, our model jointly optimizes both reconstruction loss to empower our model with predictive capabilities (by predicting next input sequence given current input sequence) and RUL prediction loss to minimize the difference between the predicted RUL and actual RUL. Furthermore, to better handle longer sequences, we employ the attention mechanism to focus on all the important input information during the training process. Finally, we propose a new dual-latent feature representation to integrate the encoder features and decoder hidden states, to capture rich semantic information in data. We conduct extensive experiments on four real datasets to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method. Experimental results show that our proposed method can achieve superior performance over 13 state-of-the-art methods consistently. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2-s2.0-85115966004
"Capsule Network Based on Double-layer Attention Mechanism and Multi-scale Feature Extraction for Remaining Life Prediction The era of big data provides a platform for high-precision RUL prediction, but the existing RUL prediction methods, which effectively extract key degradation information, remain a challenge. Existing methods ignore the influence of sensor and degradation moment variability, and instead assign weights to them equally, which affects the final prediction accuracy. In addition, convolutional networks lose key information due to downsampling operations and also suffer from the drawback of insufficient feature extraction capability. To address these issues, the two-layer attention mechanism and the Inception module are embedded in the capsule structure (mai-capsule model) for lifetime prediction. The first layer of the channel attention mechanism (CAM) evaluates the influence of various sensor information on the forecast; the second layer adds a time-step attention (TSAM) mechanism to the LSTM network to weigh the contribution of different moments of the engine's whole life cycle to the prediction, while weakening the influence of environmental noise on the prediction. The Inception module is introduced to perform multi-scale feature extraction on the weighted data to capture the degradation information to the maximum extent. Lastly, we are inspired to employ the capsule network to capture important position information of high and low-dimensional features, given its capacity to facilitate a more effective rendition of the overall features of the time-series data. The efficacy of the suggested model is assessed against other approaches and verified using the publicly accessible C-MPASS dataset. The end findings demonstrate the excellent prediction precision of the suggested approach. © The Author(s) 2024.",2-s2.0-85195373371

"Smart systems for real-time bearing faults diagnosis by using vibro-acoustics sensor fusion with Bayesian optimised 1-D CNNs Diagnosis of bearing faults in real-time is challenging when healthy bearing conditions are mixed with faulty ones, affecting the overall system of rotating machinery. Deep Learning provides an effective approach for condition-based maintenance of bearing faults, bypassing traditional signal processing complexity. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel in real-time fault detection in bearings, leveraging their feature extraction capabilities from heterogeneous sensors. Usually, selecting optimal hyperparameters for CNNs is time-consuming and impacts model performance. Recent literature demonstrates that CNNs-based models for detecting bearing faults typically undergo trial searches to select optimal hyperparameters, leading to time-intensive procedures.

"Hardware implementation of bearing fault diagnosis using empirical mode decomposition This paper presents a comprehensive methodology for developing a vibration measurement system, with a primary focus on monitoring rolling element bearings, widely recognised as pivotal components in generic machine vibration monitoring. Through the utilisation of sensors to capture vibration data signals, the system aims to meticulously analyse these signals to discern any indications of bearing health deterioration, thus facilitating the early identification of potential pre-breakdown conditions. The proposed system initiates the process by internally decomposing the three-axis vibration signal, enabling subsequent transmission of processed data to a remote location for the identification of specific faults in the roller element bearings. Installation of a three-axis accelerometer on the bearing housing, positioned radially, facilitates the capture of raw vibration data along one axial and two radial directions. Moreover, efforts to enhance computational efficiency involve cascading multiple identical modules in a serial pipeline structure, allowing for iterative loop computation of intrinsic mode functions within Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). Real-time computation is achieved through this serial pipeline structure, necessitating two distinct clock frequencies: one at 12.5 MHz for sampling and storing 3-axis vibration data in ping pong buffers, and another at 40 MHz for reading and processing the data signal retrieved from these buffers.

"Generalized dilation convolutional neural networks for remaining useful lifetime estimation In this paper, we present a novel approach for multivariate time series data analysis with special emphasis on industrial sensor data sets. The approach applies deep convolutional neural networks as a base architecture, incorporating a generalization of the dilated convolution operation on the receptive fields. The dilation operation allows for the aggregation of distributed information in the input space compared to standard convolution operation. The proposed dilation methodology allows for a trainable selection and ignorance of individual sensor features, based on their relevance to the prediction task. Furthermore, arbitrary patterns in the input feature space, including in the temporal dimension of the multivariate time series data can be extracted. In contrast to the standard dilation methodology, the proposed generalized dilation technique is end-to-end differentiable and hence can be trained with off the shelf gradient descent optimizers. Two methodologies have been proposed for the resulting constrained optimization problem namely, the Barrier Function and Top-K sampling approach. We apply the dilated convolutional neural networks to remaining useful lifetime (RUL) estimation problems where degradation recognition over a longer time horizon is crucial for precise estimation. We test the approach on two challenging benchmark datasets, namely the PRONOSTIA Bearing Dataset and the C-MAPSS Aircraft Engine Dataset for RUL prediction.

"Damage detection in ship hull structures under operational variability through strain sensing Recently, growing concern for the reliability of ship structures has emerged among stakeholders in the maritime sector. In the transition towards predictive maintenance, Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has emerged as a viable option. SHM systems seek to infer the existence or level of structural degradation using response data from in-situ sensors. In this work, damage detection in marine stiffened panels is treated. Out-of-plane deflections of the panel's plate elements act as the damage case of interest, due to being potential triggers for buckling collapse. Strain response data are employed as the damage-sensitive features. Two different approaches are employed for damage detection. In the first, the problem is cast as one of multi-class classification, where the different classes correspond to discrete deflection levels, and a detection theory-based classifier is employed. In the second, the problem is treated as one of probabilistic regression, where strain readings are mapped to the probability distribution of the deflection magnitude. Both methods are implemented on a realistic stiffened panel geometry subjected to operational variability, based on an existing vessel, while all the employed data is obtained through Finite Element (FE) simulations. Results indicate that the proposed architecture can effectively provide uncertainty-informed predictions of out-of-plane deflection levels. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85169927662

Conventionally, plant operation systems aim to improve production efficiency and product quality while facility maintenance systems aim to both maximize operational efficiency and minimize costs. However, when maximizing production efficiency, maintenance costs are not necessarily optimized. Although, operation information and maintenance information must be combined to maximize profits for the entire plant, this is rarely achieved mainly because maintenance is not always quantified. Many digital technologies can be applied to improve maintenance, monitoring and visualizing the condition of equipment, utilizing wireless sensors is the first step to make the plant maintenance more efficient. The combination with Advanced Analytics such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are strong tools for reforming plant maintenance work.

"Train bearing fault diagnosis based on multi-sensor data fusion and dual-scale residual network As one of the vital components of trains, the condition of train bearings is closely related to the safe operation of trains. Traditional bearing fault diagnosis methods based on single sensors are incapable of extracting feature information fully, resulting in low fault diagnostic accuracy. To solve the above problem, a fault diagnosis method for train bearings based on multi-sensor data fusion and dual-scale residual network (MSDF-DSRNet) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a multi-sensor data fusion method is designed to extract fault feature information comprehensively. The low-dimensional features embedded in the high-dimensional nonlinear space of multi-sensor data are extracted effectively and fused into a three-dimensional pixel matrix. Secondly, a novel intelligent diagnosis method is proposed based on the dual-scale residual network. Both in-depth and shallow features are learned on two scales, and the fault-related information in different spatial dimensions is captured, which improves the extraction ability of fusion features and effectively reduces time loss. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method are verified by three experiments. The accuracy of the proposed method in the train traction motor bearing dataset reaches 99.70%, 99.75%, 99.85% and 99.85%, respectively.

In terms of lifting techniques, the augmented filtering error dynamics is set up a unified sampling rate. By resorting to the properties of zonotopes as well as the mathematical induction, a series of zonotopic sets confining filtering errors is first received, and then their F-radii are minimized to derive the desired filter parameters. Furthermore, a zonotope-based residual evaluation mechanism is designed to detect possibly occurred faults. Finally, a numerical example is employed to verify the availability of the presented zonotope-based fault detection scheme. © 2022",2-s2.0-85133779976
"Advances in nuclear power system design and fault-based condition monitoring towards safety of nuclear-powered ships The increasing need for cleaner and sustainable shipping operations, especially in the Arctic waters, has informed the rising technological advancements in ship nuclear power machinery (SNPM) design, such as the generation IV (GenIV) small modular reactor (SMR). Nuclear technology has also provided a potential alternative to decarbonization in the maritime industry. The recent design advances present safety challenges that need to be comprehensively studied and understood. The current study shows a review of the advancements in nuclear plant design and fault-based analysis towards safety in maritime operations. A systematic approach is adopted to explore the design improvements, operational challenges, fault diagnostics methodologies, and risk assessment frameworks for SNPM. While exploring the current state of knowledge on system design and fault-based risk assessment, the study highlights key research opportunities to provide a robust risk management framework towards safer nuclear-powered shipping operations, such as digitalization, resilient system design, and the internet of things (IoT). This study finds that the state of knowledge is inexhaustive and proposes a preliminary hybrid framework, able to integrate the hierarchical hazard structure into a fault-based risk aggregation methodology for risk-informed decision making in nuclear-powered shipping operations. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85127146853
"Measurement of micro-harmonic vibration from optical feedback interferometry using wavelet trend analysis Self-mixed optical feedback interferometry based laser sensors show promising results in the measurement of the vibration frequency. To date several measurement methods have been developed to extract the vibration information from the self-mixed (SM) signal; however, the complexity and accuracy of the methods still need improvement. The presented work tries to fulfill the gap by realizing a novel method using maximal overlap discrete wavelet transformation (MODWT) and multi-resolution analysis (MRA). The proposed method can reconstruct the micro-harmonic (<5μm) vibration up to 1 kHz even under weak feedback conditions. The mean squared error and the maximum relative error of the proposed method for this range remained below 1.89×10−3& 8.79%, respectively. Although, above 1 kHz, the proposed method turns out to be futile to reconstruct the vibration signal but still capable to measure vibration frequency up to 10 kHz with an accuracy of ±0.0001. The method also found suitable to measure non-sinusoidal vibration frequency with reasonable accuracy even for the moderate feedback conditions. The authors envision that the proposed method will provide a compact, non-contact, and low-cost alternative for the vibration frequency measurement hence useful in early fault detection schemes and lung abnormality diagnosis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",2-s2.0-85088861184
"A FUEL PIPELINE MONITORING AND SECURITY SYSTEM USING WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS (WSN) Pipeline infrastructure plays a critical role in the transportation of vital resources, including oil, gas, and water. However, pipeline failures and leaks can have devastating consequences, resulting in environmental damage, economic losses, and risk to human life. Traditional methods of leak detection, such as visual inspection and pressure testing, are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and unreliable. With the advent of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), there is an opportunity to revolutionize pipeline monitoring and leak detection. In this paper, we present a system that can monitor and detect leakage early, to enable engineers carry out prompt maintenance. This is made possible by the use of a network of nodes in a WSN, placed along a pipeline, each of which is capable of measuring and reporting varying flow rates, indicative of possible leakages. The system design consists of three major layers namely, the nodes layer, the cloud layer (for data logging), and the reporting layer. Tests were conducted under various conditions. The results show that with no leakages, the average flow rates for nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 16.89747978, 16.89935602, 16.90978163, and 16.93380634 respectively. Furthermore, percentage flow rate differences of-0.02550353, 29.959675, and 30.3944134 were recorded for nodes 2, 3, and 4 respectively, after leakages occurred. The high values of the percentage difference for nodes 3 and 4 indicate a significant discrepancy in flow rate, worthy of physical inspection. The system is capable of detecting faults and leakages, even in the event of sensor failure, or network disruption. © 2024 by the author(s).",2-s2.0-85205458976

"Mechanical equipment fault diagnosis based on wireless sensor network data fusion technology To save network energy consumption and prolong network life cycle in complex mechanical fault diagnosis, a research method of data fusion routing protocol algorithm based on wireless sensor network (WSN) is proposed. The specific content of the method is as follows: First, the low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy algorithm is analyzed and discussed. On this basis, the prim route fusion algorithm is proposed to realize the effective utilization of energy and prolong the life of the network. Then, the WSN is abstracted as an undirected graph. From the perspective of saving the energy of the whole network, several current algorithms for building fusion trees are compared. The experimental results show that the prim algorithm consumes energy only after 700 rounds of clustering, while the leach clustering algorithm consumes energy only after 500 rounds. This shows that applying the prim algorithm can reduce the energy consumption of the whole network and prolong the life cycle of the network. However, the algorithm is carried out on the premise of uniform distribution of nodes, and there is a certain gap with the specific application of WSN in mechanical fault diagnosis. In the comparison of node energy consumption, it is found that compared with using the shortest path tree, using the central point of graph algorithm can greatly save the energy consumption of the node and has better performance. Practice has proved that this method can effectively remove redundant data information and solve the problem of unreliable data collected by a single sensor node. It is more suitable for the specific application of WSN in mechanical fault diagnosis.  © 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter.",2-s2.0-85161088217
"Recurrent convolutional neural network: A new framework for remaining useful life prediction of machinery Deep learning is becoming more appealing in remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of machines, because it is able to automatically build the mapping relationship between the raw data and the corresponding RUL by representation learning. Among deep learning models, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are gaining special attention because of its powerful ability in dealing with time-series signals, and have achieved promising results in current studies. These studies, however, suffer from the two limitations: (1) The temporal dependencies of different degradation states are not considered during network construction; and (2) The uncertainty of RUL prediction results cannot be obtained. To overcome the above-mentioned limitations, a new framework named recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN) is proposed in this paper for RUL prediction of machinery. In RCNN, recurrent convolutional layers are first constructed to model the temporal dependencies of different degradation states. Then, variational inference is used to quantify the uncertainty of RCNN in RUL prediction. The proposed RCNN is evaluated using vibration data from accelerated degradation tests of rolling element bearings and sensor data from life testing of milling cutters, and compared with some state-of-the-art prognostics approaches. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of RCNN in improving the accuracy and convergence of RUL prediction. More importantly, RCNN is able to provide a probabilistic RUL prediction result, which breaks the inherent limitation of CNNs and facilitates maintenance decision making. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",2-s2.0-85075360459

"Lithium-ion battery diagnostics and prognostics enhanced with Dempster-Shafer decision fusion Prognostics is the discipline of predicting the remaining useful life of a component or system in order to optimize the maintenance planning or the mission execution. Prognostics-enabled systems likely reduce the overall life-cycle cost and increase the reliability. In the Bayesian estimation framework, the widely used techniques are the traditional Kalman filter, along with its non-linear extensions, and the particle filter. Each technique has different advantages. This paper investigates the fusion of prognostic results from different techniques in order to achieve a more trustworthy remaining useful life (RUL) prediction, as measured by a reduction in uncertainty. Models for extended Kalman filter (EKF) and particle filter (PF) are developed from the feature data. The results from EKF and PF are then fused using an application of Dempster-Shafer theory (DST). Separate models are utilized for EKF and PF in order to introduce multi-model prognostics and to optimize the performance of each technique for both diagnosis and RUL prediction. Prognostics is triggered when degradation is detected by diagnosis. DST is then applied to the prognostic results from EKF and PF. The result of DST is a density function whose performance can be compared with that of EKF and PF. DST allows for the fusion of multiple sensors and state estimates.

"Capacity Building for Digital Work - A Case from Sino-German Cooperation The way humans work is constantly changing. This has always been the case, especially in dynamic environments. In the context of Industry 4.0 and the Internet of Things (IoT), collaborative platforms, accelerated by Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, give rise to new automation opportunities of complex and previously labor-intensive tasks, while also creating new business models for multiple stakeholders. Due to accelerated product innovation, the manufacturing industry needs to be able to generate solutions in a timely manner and quickly move them into production according to customer expectations. Today, machines in an Industry 4.0 factory are collaboratively connected. Such a development requires the application of advanced predictive tools that can systematically transform requirements and data into information and ultimately knowledge to manage uncertainties and make informed ad hoc decisions. In this context, a production system needs to perform rapid self-reconfiguration in response to different product characteristics to achieve an agile transition to the new manufacturing processes. However, a large number of non-standardized device interfaces and communication protocols are currently existing on the shop floor, which leads to high time and capital costs. Furthermore, this leads to insufficient reliability in the configuration of the production system, so that the requirements for customization and rapid adaptation cannot be met. In addition, there is also a large knowledge gap in the academic field of selfconfigurable intelligent production systems using collaborative engineering and IoT platforms. Therefore, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT, Germany) and TongjiUniversity (Shanghai, People’s Republic of China) have proposed the collaborative “Construction, Reference Implementation and Verification Platform of Reconfigurable Intelligent Production Systems” and the “Factory Automation Platform”, which meets the challenges of self-configuration, agile response, accumulation of domain knowledge and services, intelligent operation and maintenance of production systems. © VDI/VDE Innovation + Technik GmbH 2023, Institute for Innovation and Technology 2023.",2-s2.0-85197059005
"Improved finite-time prescribed performance based adaptive neural control for nonlinear systems with sensor faults In this article, based on a novel finite-time prescribed performance function, we consider the issue of the adaptive neural fault-tolerant tracking control problem for a type of nonlinear system with sensor faults. The control performance of the system may be affected when sensor faults occur. For the controlled system with sensor faults, an improved finite-time performance function is proposed so that its initial conditions do not need to be set in advance. Compared with existing performance functions, the performance functions in this paper can ensure that the system is always controllable, even if the sensor faults occur suddenly during the steady operation. Moreover, Radial basis function (RBF) neural networks (NNs) are employed to estimate the uncertain smooth nonlinear functions. With the help of the adaptive backstepping control technique, an improved adaptive prescribed performance control technique is developed, which can realize the boundedness of every signal in the closed-loop system, and the tracking error can be limited within the neighborhood near the origin. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. © 2023",2-s2.0-85172906379
"Optimizing an Ocean Current Energy Conversion Device for Powering Marine Sensors Ocean sensors are critical for monitoring marine conditions and understanding ocean ecosystems. However, the deployment duration of these sensors is presently limited by their battery lives, resulting in costly and time-consuming maintenance. Previously, the Water and Energy Research Laboratory (WERL), with input from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), sought to overcome this limitation by harvesting energy from ocean currents to power these sensors. They developed an ocean current energy conversion (CEC) device and tested a prototype in a tow tank, the results of which demonstrated the ability to generate at least 1 W of power from currents as slow as 0.27 m/s. These results strongly indicated feasibility of the concept and the value of continued development. Major present goals include reducing its minimum water speed to 0.2 m/s and performing in-ocean testing. The target of 0.2 m/s was identified in the initial feasibility study for the concept and would significantly increase the range of locations in which the CEC device could be deployed. To move towards this slower water speed, WERL is optimizing the device's turbine using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and CSIRO is improving the device's alternator, electronics, and subsystem integration. For turbine optimization, we used CFD simulations in multiple design-of-experiment studies to identify key turbine blade geometry parameters that influence turbine output at different operating points. This work was used to generate optimized blades, which we manufactured and installed on the CEC device prototype for retesting in the tow tank. The test results showed that we achieved our target minimum water speed of 0.2 m/s. We also developed and validated a predictive mathematical model of the alternator. This, together with a previously-developed predictive model of the overall device, allowed us to study how alternator design parameters affect the device efficiency. We found that a new alternator could improve the device efficiency by 15-20 percentage points compared to the first prototype. We plan to implement improved blades, alternator, and onboard electronics on a new CEC device prototype. This new prototype will then undergo in-ocean testing to demonstrate full field functionality of the concept.  © 2024 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85212436547

"Quantum communication based cyber security analysis using artificial intelligence with IoMT Connected electronic devices used in healthcare, such as small sensors and actuators and other cyber-physical devices, make up what is known as the Internet of Medical Things. By linking these devices, medical monitoring, analysis, and reporting may become more intelligent and autonomous, ultimately benefiting the patient. To solve these problems, a thorough plan for monitoring and assessing method health needs to be formulated.

"Dual-attention enhanced variational encoding for interpretable remaining useful life prediction In Prognostics Health Management (PHM), predicting Remaining Useful Life (RUL) is a key technique for equipment health evaluation. The utilization of deep learning methods has improved prediction accuracy. However, these approaches often fail to provide the transparency and interpretability that maintenance personnel require to diagnose equipment degradation effectively. To address this challenge, a Dual-Attention Enhanced Variational Encoding (DAEVE) approach based on Transformer is developed for more interpretable RUL prediction. This framework integrates both sensor and time step encoders, a latent space with inductive bias and a regression model: the fusion encoder compresses input data into a three-dimension(3-D) latent space, facilitating both the prediction and interpretation of the equipment degradation process. Four turbofan aircraft engine datasets are applied in extensive experiments to evaluate the efficacy of proposed method. The results demonstrate that DAEVE outperforms most state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy.

"Missing signal reconstruction and aileron fault detection via generative adversarial learning Aileron faults must be detected and identified quickly to improve the fixed-wing aircraft's safety and reliability. However, the low-frequency monitoring signals of the heterogeneous sensors are easily lost in transmission and sampling. Therefore, incomplete data will overlap fault features, leading to detection mistakes. This study proposes a generative adversarial learning framework to reconstruct missing signals based on the rest signals called Dual-hierarchical-variational Graph Autoencoder/ Generative Adversarial Network (DHVGAE/GAN). A pluggable reconstruction module is designed to enhance the generalization performance of the detection model. A dual spatiotemporal encoder (DSE) is constructed by a local graph attention network (LGAT) and Transformer-based feature extractors (TFEs) to extract common spatiotemporal features of missing and rest signals. A shared hierarchical variational autoencoder (HVAE) maps them to multiple conditionally independent latent distributions and generates reconstructed signals. The historical prior information of missing signals is transferred to the reconstruction module through adversarial learning. The detection model maintains high accuracy for data with missing signals relying on the recovered signals.

"Fault diagnosis of marine machinery via an intelligent data-driven framework Large amounts of ship accidents caused by marine machinery indicate the significance of fault diagnosis for marine machinery. Since numerous onboard sensor signals contain feature information that reflects the status of marine machinery and considering the time-consuming and experience-dependent of previous data-driven fault diagnosis methods, an intelligent data-driven framework based on a multi-head attention neural network (MANet) is proposed for the fault diagnosis of marine machinery in this work. MANet integrates the multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism, convolutional layers, and residual (Res) structure. Therein, the global correlation features in long-term operating signal sequences extracted by MHA can effectively characterize the status variation of marine machinery; the local fault features in operating signals extracted by convolutional layers can effectively characterize status information at certain moments for marine machinery; the application of Res structure in MANet is conducive to alleviating the gradient propagation anomaly. With a case study for the fault diagnosis of marine machinery, the superiority of MANet in terms of the accuracy and reliability of fault diagnosis is validated by comparing it with two recently published methods.

The SP-TVS exhibits high-frequency response (up to 15 kHz) due to the random high elastic vibration behavior of the macro-pillars and demonstrates excellent acceleration sensitivity of 2.033 V/g (0.1–0.5 g), 1.455 V/g (0.5–2.0 g), and 1.116 V/g (2.0–7.0 g) at r2 = 0.99 in low, medium, and high acceleration ranges and enables subtle vibration amplitude detections. Finally, the SP-TVS has been successfully deployed on various machineries, employing a sophisticated Artificial Intelligence algorithm to process sensor data, performs self-powered machinery identification, vibration inspection, and fault monitoring, showcasing its significant potential for a wide range of industrial monitoring applications. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85172196443
"A novel bearing fault diagnosis method using deep residual learning network Bearing fault diagnosis is a serious problem on which researchers have focused to ensure the reliability and availability of rotating machinery. Knowledge-based methods are capable of providing promising solution to bearing diagnosis problem with high accuracy performance thanks to effectively processing collected sensor and actuator data. Deep learning (DL) has the advantage of ignoring feature extraction and providing accurate diagnosis among the machine learning algorithms. In order to address this issue, in this paper, a novel DL based model is presented for fault detection and classification of motor bearing. In this work, first, time domain signals are converted to images by a proposed signal-to-image conversion approach. Then, the converted gray-scale images are fed into a novel deep residual learning (DRL) network structured to learn end-to-end mapping between images and health condition of the motor bearing. The performance of the proposed DRL network is evaluated on a commonly used real vibration dataset provided by Case Western Reserve University (CWRU). Experimental results obtained for 10 different health condition demonstrate encouraging and outperforming performance with an average accuracy of 99.98 % compared to the state-of-art knowledge-based bearing fault diagnosis methods. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2-s2.0-85122659692
"A Smart Individual Anode Current Measurement System and Its Applications This paper discusses a new individual anode current measurement scheme and its applications in real-time monitoring and control of the Hall-Héroult process. While anode current can be directly measured from the anode rod, this approach takes measurements from the anode beam allowing the sensors to remain intact through various cell operations, including anode change. This instrumentation scheme employs smart sensors that are daisy-chained on a common bus for digital data transfer. This approach limits electromagnetic interferences and offers system self-configuration and self-diagnosis, thus allowing for easy maintenance. The system can be configured to work across a broad range of cell technologies. Monitoring anode current distributions helps improve process operation and allows early detection of process faults such as perfluorocarbon co-evolution and blocked feeders. This also offers the ability to monitor process states such as local alumina concentration and bath temperature, along with potential improvements to cell operation and current efficiency. © 2023, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.",2-s2.0-85151165176
"Highly sensitive piezoelectric nanogenerators based on zinc ferrite/bacterial cellulose for vibration fault state identification in power transformers Composite of piezoelectric fillers with piezoelectric polymers is an important strategy to improve the performance of polymer-based piezoelectric devices. In this paper, a high-performance flexible piezoelectric composite of zinc ferrite/bacterial cellulose was prepared by co-precipitation method. The physical and chemical properties, electrical properties and piezoelectric properties of the composites were analyzed to assess the overall performance of the composites. The results show that the dielectric and piezoelectric constants of the composites increase with the increase of zinc ferrite (ZnFe2O4) content. The piezoelectric output response increases and then decreases, and the piezoelectric sensitivity is as high as 80 mV/N. The output voltage only decreases by 1.96 % after 15000 cycles of pressure. At the same time, the vibration state of the transformer core was detected using a flexible composite piezoelectric film, and different degrees of transformer core loosening faults were judged according to the amplitude and smoothness of the output voltage, thus achieving fault self-diagnosis.

"Inductive magnetic nanoparticle sensor based on microfluidic chip oil detection technology The wear debris in hydraulic oil or lubricating oil has a wealth of equipment operating information, which is an important basis for large mechanical equipment detection and fault diagnosis. Based on traditional inductive oil detection technology, magnetic nanoparticles are exploited in this paper. A new inductive oil detection sensor is designed based on the characteristics of magnetic nanoparticles. The sensor improves detection sensitivity based on distinguishing between ferromagnetic and non-ferromagnetic wear debris. Magnetic nanoparticles increase the internal magnetic field strength of the solenoid coil and the stability of the internal magnetic field of the solenoid coil. During the experiment, the optimal position of the sensor microchannel was first determined, then the effect of the magnetic nanoparticles on the sensor's detection was confirmed, and finally the concentration ratio of the mixture was determined. The experimental results show that the inductive oil detection sensor made of magnetic nanoparticle material had a higher detection effect, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 20-70 μm ferromagnetic particles was increased by 20%-25%. The detection signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 80-130 μm non-ferromagnetic particles was increased by 16%-20%.

"Pipeline Elbow Corrosion Simulation for Strain Monitoring with Fiber Bragg Gratings This study addresses the limitation of traditional non-destructive testing methods in real-time corrosion monitoring of pipe elbows by proposing the utilization of fiber Bragg grating (FBG) strain sensors, renowned for their resilience in harsh environments. However, the current mathematical relationship model for strain representation of elbow corrosion is still lacking. This paper develops a finite element model to scrutinize the strain changes in the elbow due to corrosion under hydrostatic pressure and bending loads. To mitigate temperature loading effects, the corrosion degree is evaluated through the disparity between hoop and axial strains. Simulation outcomes reveal that, under hydrostatic pressure, the strain difference exhibits minimal changes with the increase in corrosion degree, while under bending moment loading, the strain difference escalates proportionally with corrosion progression. Consequently, strain induced by bending moment loading solely characterizes the corrosion degree. Moreover, the optimal placement for FBG sensors is identified at the extrados of the pipe elbow, where strain is most prominent. These insights enhance comprehension of strain–corrosion dynamics in pipe elbows, offering valuable guidance for developing an FBG-based monitoring system for real-time corrosion tracking and predictive maintenance of pipeline infrastructures. © 2024 by the authors.",2-s2.0-85205129059

"Residual-based multi-filter methodology for all-source fault detection, exclusion, and performance monitoring All-source navigation has become increasingly relevant over the past decade with the development of viable alternative sensor technologies. However, as the number and type of sensors informing a system increases, so does the probability of corrupting the system with sensor modeling errors, signal interference, and undetected faults. Though the latter of these has been extensively researched, the majority of existing approaches have constrained faults to biases and designed algorithms centered around the assumption of simultaneously redundant, synchronous sensors with valid measurement models, none of which are guaranteed for all-source systems. As part of an overall all-source assured or resilient navigation objective, this research contributes a fault- and sensor-agnostic fault detection and exclusion method that can provide the user with performance guarantees without constraining the statistical distribution of the fault.

"Multi-fault diagnosis and fault degree identification in hydraulic systems based on fully convolutional networks and deep feature fusion Normal and stable operations of hydraulic systems are of great importance to the safety and efficiency of industrial production processes. Accurate and prompt diagnosis of fault types and degrees can ensure hydraulic systems return to normal in the early stage of faults and thus can prevent serious accidents. However, the structure of hydraulic systems is complex, and some faults may occur simultaneously. In addition, many hydraulic systems have multi-rate data collected from different sensors. Such problems cause great challenges to fault diagnosis in hydraulic systems. Motivated by the above issues, this paper proposes a deep learning method to diagnose faults and identify fault degrees in hydraulic systems using fully convolutional networks (FCNs) and deep feature fusion. The main contributions are twofold: (1) A new fault diagnosis framework is designed to identify both the fault types and degrees in the presence of multiple faults; and (2) deep feature extractors composed of multiple superimposed convolutional blocks are designed to extract deep features from multi-rate time series, and such features are then fused via flattening and concatenating and fed into the fault diagnosis model.

The critical elements of urban navigation are then discussed, including individ-ual INS noise parameter specifications, vehicle speed, and the effect of velocity updates. Covariance analyses performed along a 9-km-long urban transect in downtown Chicago show that velocity updates measured by wheel speed sen-sors, vehicle kinematic constraints, and zero-velocity updates can extend navigation continuity by bridging intermittent GNSS signal availability. However, position reference updates at intervals between 15 and 35 m, based on light detection and ranging data from local landmarks in our case, are needed to achieve full navigation availability through the transect. © 2024 Institute of Navigation.",2-s2.0-85184152537
"A predictive and explanatory model for remaining useful life of crushers using deep learning Current maintenance models lack the technological capabilities to generate key performance indicators that optimize both critical equipment behavior and the surrounding processes.

Additionally, the model incorporates result interpretation algorithms to analyze both training cycles and subsequent production cycles. This analysis not only identifies a process ""fingerprint"" but also recommends adjustments to the crusher system within the ongoing maintenance plan. By employing a dense neural network and interpretation algorithms, the proposed tool predicts the current crusher cycle’s RUL and compares its interpretation graphs to the process fingerprint.

"Study on Roadway Fault Diagnosis of the Mine Ventilation System Based on Improved SVM Reliable and stable mine monitoring systems are efficient tools for preventing mine accidents. Roadway faults due to deformation, destruction, or damper situation transformation can cause changes in airflow resistance. The airflow quantities of other branches also change. This phenomenon is called ventilation system failure. It is of great significance to determine the network topology location of ventilation system failure according to the changes in air volume perceived by the wind speed sensor.

"Remaining useful life prediction based on spatiotemporal autoencoder Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction has received a lot of attention as the core of prognostics and health management (PHM) technology. Deep learning-based RUL prediction methods are currently the most popular, and in order to solve the problem that most of the current deep RUL prediction studies do not consider the structural information between sensors, we propose a spatiotemporal autoencoder (STAE)-based RUL prediction method. The method extracts the time domain information from the data through the temporal convolutional network. It obtains the structural information of the sensors by converting the time series data into a graph structure by utilizing the maximal information coefficient and then performing the graph representation learning. For the two obtained features, a feature fusion method based on the graph attention mechanism is used for fusion and finally, the new fused features are utilized for RUL prediction. To validate the effectiveness of STAE, we conducted experiments on the simulated dataset C-MAPSS and the real satellite dataset SCS-PSS, and our proposed method outperforms the baseline method on both datasets. The results suggest that considering structural information between sensors in the deep RUL prediction model can improve prediction accuracy. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",2-s2.0-85184438882
"A novel impedance micro‐sensor for metal debris monitoring of hydraulic oil Hydraulic oil is the key medium for the normal operation of hydraulic machinery, which carries various wear debris. The information reflected by the wear debris can be used to predict the early failure of equipment and achieve predictive maintenance. In order to realize the real‐time condition monitoring of hydraulic oil, an impedance debris sensor that can detect inductance and resistance parameters is designed and studied in this paper. The material and size of wear debris can be discriminated based on inductance‐resistance detection method. Silicon steel strips and two rectangular channels are designed in the sensor. The silicon steel strips are used to enhance the magnetic field strength, and the double rectangular detection channels can make full use of the magnetic field distribution region, thereby improving the detection sensitivity and throughput of the sensor.

"High-Porosity Foam-Based Iontronic Pressure Sensor with Superhigh Sensitivity of 9280 kPa−1 Abstract: Flexible pressure sensors with high sensitivity are desired in the fields of electronic skins, human–machine interfaces, and health monitoring. Employing ionic soft materials with microstructured architectures in the functional layer is an effective way that can enhance the amplitude of capacitance signal due to generated electron double layer and thus improve the sensitivity of capacitive-type pressure sensors. However, the requirement of specific apparatus and the complex fabrication process to build such microstructures lead to high cost and low productivity. Here, we report a simple strategy that uses open-cell polyurethane foams with high porosity as a continuous three-dimensional network skeleton to load with ionic liquid in a one-step soak process, serving as the ionic layer in iontronic pressure sensors. The high porosity (95.4%) of PU-IL composite foam shows a pretty low Young’s modulus of 3.4 kPa and good compressibility. A superhigh maximum sensitivity of 9,280 kPa−1 in the pressure regime and a high pressure resolution of 0.125% are observed in this foam-based pressure sensor. The device also exhibits remarkable mechanical stability over 5,000 compression-release or bending-release cycles. Such high porosity of composite structure provides a simple, cost-effective and scalable way to fabricate super sensitive pressure sensor, which has prominent capability in applications of water wave detection, underwater vibration sensing, and mechanical fault monitoring.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2021, The Author(s).",2-s2.0-85120938245

"The design of an affordable fault-tolerant control system of the brushless DC motor for an active waist exoskeleton The brushless DC (BLDC) motor is a widely used method of powering various active exoskeletons such as waist exoskeleton devices. In this study, an affordable three-phase BLDC motor was designed using three 120° Hall-effect sensors to actuate an active waist exoskeleton. The fault in a Hall-effect sensor may cause the system failure. Thus, taking safety measures for the operating BLDC is a very important aspect for the device. This paper presents a model-based single-phase fault-tolerant control as a safety measure that is able to estimate speed and signal delay for Hall-effect sensors of BLDC motors used in the active waist exoskeleton. Because of motor inertia that resists changing rotational speed, the exoskeleton controller can estimate the time interval of the signal edge between the fault Hall-effect sensor and its adjacent sensor based on the sampled values of the average speed at the previous motor status. The signal delay can be used to reconstruct the faulty Hall signals. Then, the rotor position and velocity information can be corrected in time to restore the motor operation. The BLDC motor along with the controller was modeled, and a simulation was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the control strategy. The result showed that the fault-tolerant control could rapidly reconstruct the Hall signal required for motor rotation in the case of a single Hall-effect sensor failure, and ensured the stable operation for the BLDC motor on the exoskeleton. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",2-s2.0-85132771365

We then review what we see currently existing in the market, discussing some of the early implementations of optimization products through anode and rod tracking, and presenting what we currently see under development both within Metso Outotec aluminium and amongst our peers, such as other technology vendors and producers’ in-house technology departments. Currently, there are four interesting avenues emerging: (1)Advanced process simulations enabling effective debottlenecking, e.g., in the rod shop(2)Continued development of overall process optimization in the carbon area, using data sensors and analytics to further optimize anode quality. Still missing, though, is the critical real-time feedback loop from potlines(3)Predictive maintenance applications particularly for equipment-intensive areas such as the rodshop or vibrocompactors.(4)Increased autonomous operations, reducing the need for manual labour in hazardous areas. All of these have their base in understanding which process parameters need monitoring, and hence which sensors should be installed. In addition, embarking on this journey requires certain investments into analytics capabilities, i.e., people and/or software which are able to do the necessary number crunching.

"Software countermeasures against the multiple instructions skip fault model In this work, we proposed two software countermeasures (CMs) for the detection of multiple instructions skips caused by Fault Injection (FI). The first CM is based on code duplication and uses a hardware dedicated counter. The implementation of this method consists in the duplication of instructions previously turned into an idempotent form and the insertion of dedicated instructions incrementing a hardware counter in between the groups of duplicated instructions. The second CM is based on the insertion of Sensitive instruction (SI)s into a block of instructions as sensors of instruction skips. The SI is chosen based on the observed Fault Model (FM) at bit level. We experimentally validated the effectiveness of the two CMs in a 32-bit Microcontroller Unit (MCU) using Laser Fault Injection (LFI) and Electromagnetic Fault Injection (EMFI). First, the skip of multiple instructions was obtained with a fault rate of 100%. The FM at bit level was identified to be bit-reset rather than bit-set.

This enabled the employment of a Fault Detection and Exclusion (FDE) algorithm without the required minimum availability of six measurements. To increase the estimated integrity, a Spatial Feature Constraint (SFC) algorithm was implemented to constrain solutions to feasible locations within a road feature. The performance of the proposed FDE+BRAIM, SFC+BRAIM and FDE+SFC+BRAIM algorithms was evaluated for GPS and multi-sensor data. For the non-Gaussian measurement error distribution and under the test conditions, the best achieved probability of misleading information was of the order of magnitude (Formula presented.) for road-level requirements.

"Detection of localized bearing faults in PMSMs by means of envelope analysis and wavelet packet transform using motor speed and current signals The reliability of machinery plays an essential role in industrial practice, which includes the growing topic of fault detection for electric motors. Since permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSMs) usually have built-in current and speed sensors, it is advantageous to use them for fault detection purposes as they enable a non-invasive and cost-effective implementation. Focusing on speed and current signals, two methods are developed for the detection of localized bearing faults in this paper. They leverage envelope analysis and the wavelet packet transform for feature extraction before classification is performed using a support vector machine. In addition, properties of vibration signals and built-in sensor signals are discussed and important similarities are highlighted. The effectiveness of the two methods is demonstrated in the analysis of experimental measurements, where non-artificial localized bearing faults were investigated by means of the phase currents, the d-current and q-current as well as the speed signal along with a comparison to vibration signal analysis. Both methods are shown to be effective for bearing fault diagnosis and exhibit higher detection accuracies than comparable approaches, with the best results being achieved using the q-current. This highlights the viability of built-in sensors in this context. © 2025 The Authors",2-s2.0-85215086063
"An impedance sensor for distinguishing multi-contaminants in hydraulic oil of offshore machinery The cleanliness of hydraulic oil can reflect the service life of the oil and the wear state of hydraulic machinery. An impedance sensor is proposed to distinguish multi-contaminants in hydraulic oil. The impedance sensor has two detection modes: the inductance-resistance mode is used to detect metal debris, and the capacitance mode is used to distinguish water droplets and air bubbles. By adding a built-in silicon steel strip and an external silicon steel strip with high magnetic permeability, the distribution area, strength, and uniformity of the magnetic field are enhanced to improve the detection sensitivity under inductance and resistance parameters. In addition, the silicon steel strips are used as electrode plates to introduce capacitance parameter detection. The experimental results show that the resistance detection method based on coil successfully improves the detection ability for non-ferromagnetic metal debris. The impedance sensor for distinguishing multi-contaminants in hydraulic oil can provide technical support for fault diagnosis of offshore hydraulic machinery. © 2021 by the authors.

"Novel direct remaining useful life estimation of aero-engines with randomly assigned hidden nodes This paper aims to improve data-driven prognostics by presenting a novel approach of directly estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of aero-engines without requiring setting any failure threshold information or estimating degradation states. Specifically, based on the sensory data, RUL estimations are directly obtained through the universal function approximation capability of the extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm. To achieve this, the features related with the RUL are first extracted from the sensory data as the inputs of the ELM model.Besides, to optimize the number of observed sensors, three evaluation metrics of correlation, monotonicity and robustness are defined and combined to automatically select the most relevant sensor values for more effective and efficient remaining useful life predictions. The validity and superiority of the proposed approach is evaluated by the widely used turbofan engine datasets from NASA Ames prognostics data repository.The proposed approach shows improved RUL estimation applicability at any time instant of the degradation process without determining the failure thresholds. This also simplifies the RUL estimation procedure. Moreover, the random properties of hidden nodes in the ELM learning mechanisms ensures the simplification and efficiency for real-time implementation. Therefore, the proposed approach suits to real-world applications in which prognostics estimations are required to be fast. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",2-s2.0-85073984499
"Fault diagnosis of active magnetic bearings Active magnetic bearings (AMBs) are intrinsically unstable systems and require feedback control to ensure stable operation. Further, sensors, actuators, and the rotor need to operate under normal conditions, and a fault detection and diagnostics system is necessary to ensure a safe and reliable operation. Accordingly, several studies have developed methods to detect failures associated with the rotor or the electrical system (i.e., AMB). However, prior identification of the dynamic system parameters or the magnetic forces is usually desired, which can be impractical for real machines. To overcome this problem, this study proposes a failure detection method based on a mathematical model and the correlation between the measured states related to the rotor and the control. Artificial neural networks are used to map the states that cannot be measured, and faults are determined by comparing the output correlations of neural networks. Faults in the AMB/rotor system are identified considering various rotor unbalance configurations (mechanical failures) and failures in the position sensor gain and in the magnetic actuator current (electrical failures). Various fault configurations were explored for each case cited. A comparison of the theoretical and experimental results showed good agreement, which demonstrates the adequacy of the method in detecting mechanical and electrical failures in industrial machines. © 2022",2-s2.0-85127232171
"Construction of hierarchical health indicators for explainable monitoring in multi-component mechatronic systems The development of explainable health indicators (HIs) for multi-component mechatronic systems is vital for monitoring their performance, ensuring their reliability, and optimizing their operational efficiency across a wide range of industries. These indicators play a pivotal role in detecting and diagnosing faults, assessing system health, and guiding maintenance decisions. However, achieving explainability in HIs poses significant challenges, including the selection of the most relevant sensors, the accurate modeling of degradation trends influenced by maintenance activities, and the integration of component dynamics into a system-level representation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel methodology for constructing hierarchical HIs — a two-level structure where component-level degradation signals are first modeled individually, then systematically aggregated to form a comprehensive system-level health representation. The proposed approach, named TRSAE, incorporates an automated sensor selection process to identify the most important sensors, reducing redundancy while improving interpretability. Furthermore, maintenance and downtime effects are explicitly integrated into the modeling process to ensure a more realistic and reliable assessment of system health. By tackling these challenges, our methodology improves transparency in system behavior, strengthens diagnostic capabilities, and builds trust in predictive maintenance decisions. The proposed methodology is validated through a case study in an iron mining system, an environment characterized by extreme operating conditions and continuous heavy loads that accelerate the degradation of critical components. The case study demonstrates how hierarchical HIs can capture complex degradation dynamics, optimize sensor usage, and improve remaining useful life (RUL) predictions, offering actionable insights for proactive maintenance planning and reliable system operation. © 2025",2-s2.0-105010211888

"Fault Diagnosis in Dynamic Systems Using Recurrent Neural Networks The aim of this paper is to discuss the methodology of Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) in dynamic systems. Fault diagnosis is characterized as a control system that controls the ability to adapt system component faults automatically. Fault detection is an implementation of using the error signals, where when error signal is zero or approximately zero. A coupled water tank system was used as a study case model for implementing and testing the proposed methodology. The developed system should generate a set of signals to notify the process operator about the faults that are occurring, enabling changes in control strategy or control parameters. Due to the damage risks involved with sensors, actuators and structural faults of the real plant, the data set of the faults are computationally generated and the results will be collected from numerical simulations of the process model.

"Artificial Intelligence of Manufacturing Robotics Health Monitoring System by Semantic Modeling Robotics is widely used in nearly all sorts of manufacturing. Steady performance and accurate movement of robotics are vital in quality control. Along with the coming of the Industry 4.0 era, oceans of sensor data from robotics are available, within which the health condition and faults are enclosed. Considering the growing complexity of the manufacturing system, an automatic and intelligent health-monitoring system is required to detect abnormalities of robotics in real-time to promote quality and reduce safety risks.

"An Enhanced Mechanism for Fault Tolerance in Agricultural Wireless Sensor Networks Fault tolerance is a critical aspect for any wireless sensor network (WSN), which can be defined in plain terms as the quality of being dependable or performing consistently well. In other words, it may be described as the effectiveness of fault tolerance in the event of crucial component failures in the network.

"Leak detection and localization in water distribution networks by combining expert knowledge and data-driven models Leaks represent one of the most relevant faults in water distribution networks (WDN), resulting in severe losses. Despite the growing research interest in critical infrastructure monitoring, most of the solutions present in the literature cannot completely address the specific challenges characterizing WDNs, such as the low spatial resolution of measurements (flow and/or pressure recordings) and the scarcity of annotated data. We present a novel integrated solution that addresses these challenges and successfully detects and localizes leaks in WDNs. In particular, we detect leaks by a sequential monitoring algorithm that analyzes the inlet flow, and then we validate each detection by an ad hoc statistical test. We address leak localization as a classification problem, which we can simplify by a customized clustering scheme that gathers locations of the WDN where, due to the low number of sensors, it is not possible to accurately locate leaks. A relevant advantage of the proposed solution is that it exposes interpretable tuning parameters and can integrate knowledge from domain experts to cope with scarcity of annotated data. Experiments, performed on a real dataset of the Barcelona WDN with both real and simulated leaks, show that the proposed solution can improve the leak detection and localization performance with respect to methods proposed in the literature. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",2-s2.0-85119377586
"Low-Profile Capacitive Load Cells for Underground Mining Material and Wear Classification to Promote Worker Safety This work proposes a capacitive load cell for conical picks to enable underground continuous mining machine operators to perform their roles away from known hazardous regions near the machine. The load cell is embedded in commercially available flexible printed circuit board, integrates with the target tooling, and demonstrates in situ force sensing of vibration signatures for continuous mining cutting tools. Changes in material constitution, tool mass, and tool geometry cause modal variations in vibrational response measurable with force sensors at the cutting interface. Time-series measurements are captured during rock cutting tests using a linear cutting machine. These measurements are segmented into small windows, less than 0.25 s, and are preprocessed using the fast Fourier transform, which highlights the modal variations. The transformed measurements are then classified into different material and wear categories using support-vector machines with the radial basis function kernel. Different normalization schemes and Fourier transform methods are tested for signal preprocessing. Results show that the power spectral density measurements with normally distributed coefficients give good results for material classification, while the normalized time-domain measurements give better results for wear classification. Under laboratory conditions, this technique is shown to classify material and wear categories with F1 score above 0.85 out of 1.0 for our experiment.

Current designs rely on planar wafer- or chip-level integration, which is limited by pressure range, chip size, and low reliability. We propose a small-size temperature/high-pressure integrated sensor via the flip-chip technique. The pressure and temperature units are arranged vertically, and the sensing signals of the two units are integrated into one plane through silicon vias and gold–gold bonding, reducing the lateral size and improving the efficiency of signal transmission.

In this study, a triboelectric pad journal bearing (T-PJB) was designed and fabricated to directly monitor the bearing condition. Through simulation, the geometrical structure of the T-PJB for high output was optimized, and the electrical performance was examined under various rotating conditions. The speed of the bearing shaft could be accurately measured using time- and frequency-domain methods. During the operation, faults caused by unbalanced forces were effectively identified based on the characteristics of the electrical output signals. Furthermore, the proposed T-PJB can be applied to monitor lubrication states because of its sensitive response to different lubrication conditions. Condition monitoring using the proposed T-PJB greatly contributes to reduced maintenance costs and long-term stable operation of various sliding bearings. Furthermore, the demonstrated smart T-PJB has promising feasibility in industrial applications for rotating machinery, establishing the foundation for smart plants. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85138995871
"Triboelectric nanogenerator-embedded intelligent bearing with rolling ball defect diagnosis via signal decomposition and automated machine learning Smart fault diagnosis of bearings is of great significance due to their extensive applications on various occasions. Recently, self-powered sensing technology based on triboelectric nanogenerators promotes the development of intelligent bearings. However, the effective detection and recognition of the rolling element defects of bearings need to be investigated further. This study proposes a triboelectric sensor-embedded rolling bearing (T-bearing) to monitor the working conditions and conduct the defect diagnosis of rolling balls. The interdigitated copper electrode covered by polytetrafluoroethylene film is attached to the inner surface of the outer ring of a commercial bearing. Such a design not only directly forms the TENG with rolling balls to obtain the contact-sensing signals, but also successfully achieves the diagnosis of rolling ball defects with similar triboelectric signals through a novel analysis and prediction paradigm combining signal decomposition and automated machine learning. Finally, a recognition accuracy of 99.48% with five different conditions of bearing balls is reached, which is extremely superior to the highest accuracy of 78.34% without signal decomposition. Thus, this study provides a new strategy for the defect diagnosis and the intelligent application of triboelectric bearings. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85177583256
"Intelligent triboelectric sliding bearing for gas leak self-sensing and mechanical fault self-diagnosis in green ammonia production To address carbon neutrality and peak carbon emissions, harvesting mechanical energy from bearings and converting it into electrical energy to drive ammonia leakage alarm, as well as bearings’ mechanical fault self-diagnosis, is challenging yet highly demanded in the green ammonia production industry. Herein, we demonstrated an Intelligent Triboelectric Sliding Bearing (ITSB) system, featuring a free-standing rotary barrel-shaped triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), a gallium oxide (Ga2O3)/MXene nanocomposite-based NH3 gas sensor and a self-driven data transmission unit. In addition to retaining the traditional load-bearing function, the free-standing rotary barrel-shaped TENG converted the friction from rotational motion into electrical energy, providing continuous power for sensing and data transmission. Low-cost Ga₂O₃/MXene composite was fabricated as a gas-sensitive film for NH3 using a combined hydrothermal synthesis and physical composite method. The composite film-based interdigitated electrode demonstrated a highly sensitive (65.7 % @2 ppm) and fast response (5 s@2 ppm) to NH3 gas with surface synergy effect performance confirmed through density functional theory calculations (DFT). Additionally, the self-driven data transmission unit were implemented to autonomously regulate and store the free-standing rotary barrel-shaped TENG output for sensing and mechanical operation monitoring. A neural network algorithm was developed to predict mechanical failures of bearings. By integrating on-site data, the accuracy reached 99 %.

"A Secure Barrier Coverage Scheduling Framework for WSN-based IoT Applications Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are network enabling technology for a variety of mission-critical IoT applications. The essential Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of these applications include extended network lifetime, coverage, and connectivity. Barrier scheduling is an efficient energy conservation scheme that can be designed to guarantee these QoS requirements. In barrier scheduling, only a subset of sensor nodes called barriers are activated to conserve energy. The failures of sensor nodes in the barrier can significantly impact the efficacy of barrier scheduling to meet QoS requirements. Faults that cause these failures can be unintentional (software or hardware failures) or intentional (security attacks). Intentional faults are more dangerous than unintentional faults as it can make the entire network utterly dysfunctional at a faster pace. WSNs are easily prone to such intentional faults due to its inherent limitations such as limited battery power, limited bandwidth, unattended deployment, broadcast communication medium, and lack of tamper-proof hardware. This paper proposes a secure barrier coverage scheduling framework that utilizes a novel cluster ensemble approach called KSH in detecting and isolating intentional security faults. The experiment results show that our proposed KSH approach was able to effectively classify and predict the faults with high accuracy and precision. © 2020 ACM.",2-s2.0-85097786756
"A FAULT DETECTION DIAGNOSIS PREDICT OBSERVER BASED ON RESOURCE ALLOCATION NETWORK A fault observer based on RAN (resource allocation network) neural network prediction is proposed for fault detection in a control system with network delay. Firstly, the robust controller is designed to ensure the stability of the system under uncertainty parameters and external disturbances. Then, an observer-based robust control method is used to construct a fault observer. Thus the residual of NCS (network control system) is generated, and the controller and observer gains are obtained by Lyapunov stability criterion and robust toolbox LMI (linear matrix inequality) method. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithm is verified by simulation.

"A Smart IoT System for Continuous Sleep State Monitoring Sleep is a vital process in the maintenance of health and well-being. The effects of poor or deprived sleep can have a major impact on the daily, healthy functioning of the human body and can lead to serious health issues. Current, prevalent tests can be expensive, cumbersome and not conducive to long-term monitoring of sleep. However, the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm offers an inexpensive alternative and can enable long-term, continuous monitoring of sleep. In this work, we tackle the problem of continuous sleep state segmentation in streaming data to temporally localize and recognize the sleep state. We show that predictive learning-based self-supervised representation learning can be used to learn robust features for both supervised and unsupervised sleep state segmentation. We obtain best accuracy of 96.2%(1 patient), an average accuracy of 81.8%(10 patients) on the wake vs sleep classification and best accuracy of 78.9%(1 patient), an average accuracy of 67.3%(10 patients) on the much harder multi-stage sleep classification task.

"Sensitive self-powered particles detection based on cumulative triboelectric charging Detection of particles with or without charge arouses enormous interest in energy, medical service, industrial processing, and equipment monitoring fields. In this paper, a self-powered particles sensor based on a triboelectric nanogenerator (PS-TENG) is designed to characterize particles by detecting the outputs induced by the triboelectrification between the particles and the PTFE surface. Ascribed to the cumulative triboelectric charging effect on the PTFE surface, the output voltage of PS-TENG is significantly amplified. Then the relationships between the output voltage and the material and size of particles are systematically studied, based on which the characteristics of the random particles are accurately detected. The detection principle and characterization method using PS-TENG for charged particles are also proposed and further demonstrated by systematical comparison with detection of Faraday cup method. Furthermore, based on a PS-TENG with double electrodes, the average velocity of particles and particle mass flow can also be measured.

"Correlation-Based Misalignment Diagnosis in Rotating Machines Using Order Tracking and Signal Segmentation Shaft misalignment is a prevalent fault in rotating machinery, leading to increased vibration, accelerated wear, and potential failure. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for ensuring system reliability and safety. This work presents a novel misalignment diagnosis method based on correlation analysis of vibration signal cycles. The approach consists of order tracking, filtering, signal segmentation, and correlation mapping. Order tracking transforms the signal into the angular domain to eliminate speed variations, while a band-pass filter isolates low-order frequency components linked to misalignment. The segmented signal cycles are then analyzed for correlation, and the resulting correlation map serves as a diagnostic tool. Unlike machine learning-based methods, the proposed approach does not require historical training data. Moreover, it relies on vibration data from a single sensor, making it more practical than orbit-based techniques that require multiple sensors. The method’s effectiveness is validated through experiments on a public dataset, demonstrating its potential for robust and data-efficient misalignment detection. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",2-s2.0-105010224173
"Multi-scale kernel Fisher discriminant analysis with adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) in fault detection and diagnosis framework for chemical process systems Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) framework is one of safety aspects that is important to the industrial sector to ensure its high-quality production and processes. However, the development of FDD system in chemical process systems could have difficulties, e.g. highly nonlinear correlation within the variables, highly complex process, and an enormous number of sensors to be monitored. These issues have encouraged the development of various approaches to increase the effectiveness and robustness of the FDD framework, such as the wavelet transform analysis, where it has the advantage in extracting the significant features in both time and frequency domain. It has motivated us to propose an extension work of the multi-scale KFDA method, where we have modified it with the implementation of Parseval’s theorem and the application of ANFIS method to improve the performance of the fault classification. In this work, through the implementation of Parseval’s theorem, the observation of fault features via the energy spectrum and effective reduction in DWT analysis data quantity can be accomplished. The extracted features from the multi-scale KFDA method are used for fault diagnosis and classification, where multiple ANFIS models were developed for each designated fault pattern to increase the classification accuracy and reduce the diagnosis error rate. The fault classification performance of the proposed framework has been evaluated using a benchmarked Tennessee Eastman process.

"Resonant sensors for multi-axis force and torque estimation in collaborative robotics This paper presents a complete design methodology for a multi-axis resonant force sensor. The proposed device has been designed to be useable in a context of physical interaction between robots and humans. The proposed solution allows the three force components and the three torque components to be measured simultaneously and can be inserted into an interface handle or a robot end-effector. The information on wrench can then be used to detect and control interactions for cooperative tasks between humans and robots. In the context of sensors for robotic co-manipulation, it is imperative to guarantee not only a certain level of performance (accuracy, dynamics, size) but also to guarantee certain non-functional specifications associated with safety, measurement redundancy or functional integration of the sensor into its environment. The consideration of all these design specifications, both functional and non-functional, led to the principles and technologies used to develop this sensor. Multi-axis resonant sensors have excellent performance and safety characteristics, two key elements for collaborative robotics, but the literature review did not reveal any significant previous work in this area.

"Highly Reliable Multicomponent MEMS Sensor for Predictive Maintenance Management of Rolling Bearings In the field of vibration monitoring and control, the use of low-cost multicomponent MEMS-based accelerometer sensors is nowadays increasingly widespread. Such sensors allow implementing lightweight monitoring systems with low management costs, low power consumption and a small size. However, for the monitoring systems to provide trustworthy and meaningful data, the high accuracy and reliability of sensors are essential requirements. Consequently, a metrological approach to the calibration of multi-component accelerometer sensors, including appropriate uncertainty evaluations, are necessary to guarantee traceability and reliability in the frequency domain of data provided, which nowadays is not fully available.

"Energy Harvesting Microelectromechanical System for Condition Monitoring Based on Piezoelectric Transducer Ring For complex mechanical transmission equipment, shaft bearings are usually enclosed together with the shaft in the internal space of the housing to maintain good sealing and reliability. However, it is difficult to monitor the status of the shaft bearing through external sensors on the housing, while internal sensors face challenges in energy supply and data transmission. Therefore, a piezoelectric transducer ring-based energy harvesting microelectromechanical system (PTR-EH-MEMS) is proposed for the condition monitoring of shaft bearings. Specifically, the piezoelectric transducer ring is designed to convert mechanical vibrations into electrical energy, which simultaneously acts as a self-powered monitoring sensor through energy harvesting. In addition, the MEMS is embedded for piezoelectric data processing and condition monitoring of the shaft bearings.

"Fault Tolerance in Electric Vehicles Using Deep Learning for Intelligent Transportation Systems Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) such as hybrid electric vehicles make use of sensing technologies to improve mobility, safety and efficiency. Automated manual transmission (AMT) is a mechatronic device consisting of Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled sensors and actuators responsible for automatic gear shifting in hybrid electric vehicles. Any failure in these sensors or actuators can affect the normal operation of vehicles. Therefore, this study aims to discuss the characteristics of AMT when it breaks down and its impact on the whole hybrid electric vehicle system. Firstly, this paper briefly introduces the relevant overview of hybrid electric vehicles and AMT. Next, analytical redundancy analysis is used to find out the possible faults of each part of AMT and the causes of each fault. The normal and faulty signals are then passed to a reduced depth kernel extreme learning machine (RDK-ELM) algorithm, which combines the deep learning network structure with the kernel-based selection of support vectors from the training samples. The RDK-ELM is a fault diagnosis algorithm that classifies the normal and faulty signals, which represent whether the sensor is faulty or not.

"Model predictive control-based fault detection and reconstruction algorithm for longitudinal control of autonomous driving vehicle using multi-sliding mode observer This paper presents a model predictive control-based fault detection and reconstruction algorithm for longitudinal control of autonomous driving using a multi-sliding mode observer. In order to secure the safe longitudinal control of a vehicle, a numbers of factors must be ensured, such as the reliability of the longitudinal information, the data on the forward object from the environment sensor, and the acceleration of the ego vehicle. Thus, we propose a reasonable failure detection scheme for the acceleration signal of the host vehicle and the relative values of the front object of the radar. In order to identify the faults of the radar and the vehicle acceleration sensor related to the automated longitudinal control, the multiple sliding mode observer and prediction of model predictive control (MPC) algorithm are applied. The relative acceleration is reconstructed by applying a sliding mode observer (SMO) with clearance and relative speed measurements. The upper and lower limits of longitudinal acceleration were computed by analyzing human driving data under the preceding vehicle and reconstructed acceleration. A proper acceleration range can be defined precisely based on several reconstructed upper and lower bounds by using a multiple sliding mode observer with stored prediction data of relative values, making it possible to effectively identify the fault of the host vehicle’s acceleration sensor. By applying MPC for this study, optimal control input and prediction of relative states can be obtained that are more reasonable than those using the linear prediction model. The proposed fault detection algorithm can identify the abnormal state of the environment sensors by using the accumulated past sensor data. By comparing the stored prediction of relative states with the stored data on current states for a given period, the signal faults of the longitudinal target information can be detected from environment sensors. With these fault indices of states, the final fault diagnoses of sensors can be determined by assessing confidence through statistical analysis of 27 sets of normal driving data. In order to obtain a reasonable performance evaluation, this study uses actual driving data and a 3D full vehicle model constructed in the MATLAB/Simulink environment.

The innovation of the sensor is based on the inductance detection method. Permalloy is embedded in the sensing region of the sensor, so that the detection area generates a high gradient magnetic field to enhance the detection accuracy of the sensor.

Experimental results show that when a piece of permalloy is added to the sensing unit, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of iron particles is increased by more than 20%, and the signal-to-noise ratio of copper particles is increased by more than 70%.

"Feature analysis and ensemble-based fault detection techniques for nonlinear systems Machine learning approaches play a crucial role in nonlinear system modeling across diverse domains, finding applications in system monitoring, anomaly/fault detection, control, and various other areas. With technological advancements, today such systems might include hundreds or thousands of sensors that generate large amounts of multivariate data streams. This inevitably results in increased model complexity. In response, feature selection techniques are widely employed as a means to reduce complexity, avoid the curse of high dimensionality, decrease training and inference times, and eliminate redundant features. This paper introduces a sensitivity-inspired feature analysis technique for regression tasks. Leveraging the energy distance on the model prediction errors, this approach performs both feature ranking and selection. Additionally, this paper introduces an ensemble-based unsupervised fault detection methodology that incorporates homogeneous units, specifically long short-term memory (LSTM) predictors and cumulative sum-based detectors. The proposed predictors utilize a variant of the teacher forcing (TF) algorithm during both the training and inference phases. Additionally, predictors are used to model the normal behavior of the system, whereas detectors are used to identify deviations from normality. The detector decisions are aggregated using a majority voting scheme. The validity of the proposed approach is illustrated on the two representative datasets, where numerous experiments are performed for feature selection and fault detection evaluation. Experimental assessment reveals promising results, even compared to well-established techniques.

"Resilience Monitoring for Multi-Filter All-Source Navigation Framework With Assurance The Autonomous and Resilient Management of All-source Sensors (ARMAS) framework monitors residual-space test statistics across unique sensor-exclusion banks of filters (known as subfilters) to provide a resilient, fault-resistant all-source navigation architecture with assurance. A critical assumption of this architecture, demonstrated in this paper, is fully overlapping state observability across all subfilters. All-source sensors, particularly those that only provide partial state information (altimeters, TDoA, AOB, etc.), do not intrinsically meet this requirement. This paper presents a novel method to monitor real-time overlapping position state observability and introduces an observability bank within the ARMAS framework, known as stable observability monitoring (SOM). SOM uses a monitoring-epoch stability analysis to provide an intrinsic awareness to ARMAS of the capabilities of the fault detection and exclusion (FDE) functionality. We define the ability to maintain consistent all-source FDE to recover failed sensors as navigation resilience. A resilient FDE capability is one that is aware of when it requires more sensor information to protect the consistency of the FDE and integrity functions from corruption. SOM is the first demonstration of such a system for all-source sensors that the authors are aware of. A multi-agent 3D environment simulating both GNSS and position and velocity alternative navigation sensors was created and individual GNSS pseudorange sensor anomalies are utilized to demonstrate the capabilities of the novel algorithm. This paper demonstrates that SOM seamlessly integrates within the ARMAS framework, provides timely prompts to augment new sensor information from other agents, and indicates when framework stability and preservation of all-source navigation integrity are achieved. © 2022 Institute of Navigation.",2-s2.0-85144412075

This paper deals with a selection of digital support tools developed and used at AMAG casting to further improve condition-based maintenance and increased equipment availability. © 2023, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.",2-s2.0-85151120040
"A bacterial sensor taxonomy across earth ecosystems for machine learning applications Microbial communities have evolved to colonize all ecosystems of the planet, from the deep sea to the human gut. Microbes survive by sensing, responding, and adapting to immediate environmental cues. This process is driven by signal transduction proteins such as histidine kinases, which use their sensing domains to bind or otherwise detect environmental cues and “transduce” signals to adjust internal processes. We hypothesized that an ecosystem’s unique stimuli leave a sensor “fingerprint,” able to identify and shed insight on ecosystem conditions. To test this, we collected 20,712 publicly available metagenomes from Host-associated, Environmental, and Engineered ecosystems across the globe. We extracted and clustered the collection’s nearly 18M unique sensory domains into 113,712 similar groupings with MMseqs2. We built gradient-boosted decision tree machine learning models and found we could classify the ecosystem type (accuracy: 87%) and predict the levels of different physical parameters (R2 score: 83%) using the sensor cluster abundance as features. Feature importance enables identification of the most predictive sensors to differentiate between ecosystems which can lead to mechanistic interpretations if the sensor domains are well annotated. To demonstrate this, a machine learning model was trained to predict patient’s disease state and used to identify domains related to oxygen sensing present in a healthy gut but missing in patients with abnormal conditions. Moreover, since 98.7% of identified sensor domains are uncharacterized, importance ranking can be used to prioritize sensors to determine what ecosystem function they may be sensing. Furthermore, these new predictive sensors can function as targets for novel sensor engineering with applications in biotechnology, ecosystem maintenance, and medicine. IMPORTANCE Microbes infect, colonize, and proliferate due to their ability to sense and respond quickly to their surroundings. In this research, we extract the sensory proteins from a diverse range of environmental, engineered, and host-associated metagenomes. We trained machine learning classifiers using sensors as features such that it is possible to predict the ecosystem for a metagenome from its sensor profile. We use the optimized model’s feature importance to identify the most impactful and predictive sensors in different environments. We next use the sensor profile from human gut metagenomes to classify their disease states and explore which sensors can explain differences between diseases. The sensors most predictive of environmental labels here, most of which correspond to uncharacterized proteins, are a useful starting point for the discovery of important environment signals and the development of possible diagnostic interventions. © 2023 Park et al.

"Industrial IoT Challenges and Applications One of the most common applications of Internet of Things is industrial automation. It includes smart sensors, servers, various software platforms and various tools etc. These sensors continuously collect and send the data to the cloud for processing, data storing and for further analysis. Further, it is accessed easily using smartphone applications. To improve accuracy of various stages of processing and to monitor the process, automation of tools plays a significant role. Many industries are developing intelligent robots for the factories which are IOT enabled. This interface of man and machine improves the productivity and reduces the errors and complexity. The complex tasks are programmed into the robots along with other interfaced sensors. The other interconnected robotic networks to the cloud are monitored and corrections can be provided if there is any failure. Similarly, the sensors connected to the system will detect the issues in prior, in order to avoid the complete system shut down. So, predictive maintenance can be carried out for unexpected issues in the machines, failure of some products and loss in the manufacturing. The automation can be introduced in self-driving vehicles for the logistics management. The location of delivery is programmed with GPS data and it can reach the destination on time. The power management is the next important factor, which needs to be automated. The parameters like liquid flow, humidity, heat, air conditioners and control of lights can be monitored automatically using sensors. The overall advantages of the automation by IOT in industry gives increased accuracy, high efficiency, enhanced security, power management, reduction in the downtime of equipment, remote monitoring, predictive maintenance and cost effectiveness. This summarizes the Industry 4.0 in terms of connectivity with intelligent production. Further, it is used for massive connectivity of things and data. Hence, the various challenges in the industry such as latency, interoperability, wireless coexistence, data streaming, safety, security and privacy are addressed. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Dilip Kumar Choudhary, Naveen Mishra, Indrasen Singh, Naser Ojaroudi Parchin, and Ghanshyam Singh; individual chapters, the contributors.",2-s2.0-85215260491
"PS-BBICS: Pulse stretching bulk built-in current sensor for on-chip measurement of single event transients The bulk built-in current sensor (BBICS) is a cost-effective solution for detection of energetic particle strikes in integrated circuits. With an appropriate number of BBICSs distributed across the chip, the soft error locations can be identified, and the dynamic fault-tolerant mechanisms can be activated locally to correct the soft errors in the affected logic. In this work, we introduce a pulse stretching BBICS (PS-BBICS) constructed by connecting a standard BBICS and a custom-designed pulse stretching cell. The aim of PS-BBICS is to enable the on-chip measurement of the single event transient (SET) pulse width, allowing to detect the linear energy transfer (LET) of incident particles, and thus assess more accurately the radiation conditions. Based on Spectre simulations, we have shown that for the LET from 1 to 100 MeV cm2 mg−1, the SET pulse width detected by PS-BBICS varies by 620–800 ps. The threshold LET of PS-BBICS increases linearly with the number of monitored inverters, and it is around 1.7 MeV cm2 mg−1 for ten monitored inverters. On the other hand, the SET pulse width is independent of the number of monitored inverters for LET > 4 MeV cm2 mg−1. It was shown that supply voltage, temperature and process variations have strong impact on the response of PS-BBICS. © 2022 The Authors",2-s2.0-85140981999

"Dual-Channel Sensor Fault Detection and Isolation Based on Nonlinear Kalman Filter In order to solve the problems caused by the inherent complex nonlinearity and the limitation of traditional linear modeling technology in engine fault diagnosis, the Equilibrium manifold model is introduced in this paper, The equilibrium manifold model can describe the actual operating state of the engine more accurately, and capture the higher-order nonlinear characteristics that are ignored by the traditional linear model.Furthermore, a dual-channel sensor fault diagnosis and isolation approach is proposed, which integrates the nonlinear engine model with the Cubature Kalman filter. Simulations conducted that, compared to traditional Kalman filter-based methods, this approach not only reduces the demands on data storage and computational resources but also achieves accurate sensor fault diagnosis.

"Dynamic sensor fault detection approach using data-driven techniques Sensor fault detection is an important phase for process surveillance. Indeed, successful execution of process tasks depends on the state of the available data. In industrial applications, systems have an uncertain behavior, so methods based on interval principles are useful in this context, such as interval kernel principal component analysis (IKPCA) and Interval-Kernel-Partial-Least Square (IKPLS). These techniques do not always achieve efficiency since they are based on an invariant time. To overcome this restriction, we used a sliding windows principle to develop these methods in dynamic uncertain systems. In addition, a small size of the sliding window can improve the computation time and adapt to the rapidly changing process dynamics. It is for this reason that we propose a second method; the reduced rank moving window IKPCA method (MW-RRIKPCA), In order to improve the performance of the suggested methods based on sliding windows, compared to classical ones, we carried out a comparative study using Tennessee Eastman process (TEP) data and the air quality monitoring network (AIRLOR). © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024.",2-s2.0-85192175056

"A hybrid method based on deep learning and ensemble learning for induction motor fault detection using sound signals Fault detection in induction motors has an important role in saving costs in various industries. Due to the wide range of faults in induction motors, using different electrical and mechanical properties such as motor current, vibration, heat, and flux to detect faults in different conditions is necessary. In this research, A fault detection scheme using sound signals has been proposed. Sound signals are not sensitive to faults, or their signal-to-noise ratio is lower than other properties but acquiring sound signals does not need direct contact with the motor or to stop the motor in many cases, and sound sensors (microphones) have a lower cost than other types of sensors. The proposed method uses a hybrid combination of Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), Wavelet scattering, ensemble learning, convolutional neural network (CNN) classification methods. The results of ensemble learning and CNN are combined in a novel FUSION step, and the final result is determined. The proposed method was implemented on a standard database, and its efficiency was proved compared to the state-of-the-art methods. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.",2-s2.0-85178462012
"Intelligent planetary gear fault diagnosis system based on MEMS acoustic emission sensor Early equipment fault diagnosis can identify potential risks, significantly reduce maintenance costs, and minimize property damage. However, vibration, strain, and force sensors operating at low frequencies with narrow bandwidths are insufficiently sensitive to fault information, making early fault prediction challenging. Here, we introduce a high-performance, cost-effective, and tiny-sized micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) acoustic emission sensor. This sensor utilizes a 10 × 11 hexagonal array of piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducers with a chip size of 4 mm × 4 mm × 0.4 mm. The sensor is encapsulated using an epoxy/Al2O3 composite for acoustic impedance matching, and its overall size is Φ 16 mm × H 5.5 mm, with a weight of approximately 3 g. This acoustic emission sensor achieves a peak sensitivity of 88.4 dB (ref. V/(m/s)) at 335 kHz, and its sensitivity remains above 60 dB across the frequency range from 15 kHz to 620 kHz. In addition, combined with the residual neural networks, an intelligent fault diagnosis of the planetary gear is realized.

"Predictive Modeling of Photovoltaic Panel Power Production through On-Site Environmental and Electrical Measurements Using Artificial Neural Networks Weather disturbances pose a significant challenge when estimating the energy production of photovoltaic panel systems. Energy production and forecasting models have recently been used to improve energy estimations and maintenance tasks. However, these models often rely on environmental measurements from meteorological units far from the photovoltaic systems. To enhance the accuracy of the developed model, a measurement Internet of Things (IoT) prototype was developed in this study, which collects on-site voltage and current measurements from the panel, as well as the environmental factors of lighting, temperature, and humidity in the system’s proximity. The measurements were then subjected to correlation analysis, and various artificial neural networks (ANNs) were implemented to develop energy estimations and forecasting models. The most effective model utilizes lighting, temperature, and humidity. The model achieves a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.255326464. The ANN models are compared to an MLR model using the same data. Using previous power measurements and actual weather data, a non-autoregressive neural network (Non-AR-NN) model forecasts future output power values. The best Non-AR-NN model produces an RMSE of 0.1160, resulting in accurate predictions based on the IoT device. © 2023 by the authors.",2-s2.0-85199574908

"Diagnostics and Fault-Tolerant Path Planning This chapter presents a flatness-based approach to fault-tolerant control. For a differentially flat system, it is possible to find a set of variables, called flat outputs, such that states and control inputs can be expressed as functions of flat outputs and their time derivatives. The fault detection and isolation stage is implemented using a simple threshold-based approach, and the residual signal is obtained by comparing the signal coming from the sensor and the fault-free version obtained from the differential flatness. Regarding reconfiguration, the redundant state signals could be used as the controller reference in order to hide the fault effects. This will be helpful to provide an entirely flatness-based fault-tolerant control strategy. © 2020 ISTE Press Ltd Published by Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.",2-s2.0-85129060861

"VisPro: a prognostic SqueezeNet and non-stationary Gaussian process approach for remaining useful life prediction with uncertainty quantification Rotating machinery is essential to modern life, from power generation to transportation and a host of other industrial applications. Since such equipment generally operates under challenging working conditions which can lead to untimely failures, accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is essential for maintenance planning and prevention of catastrophic failures. In this work, we address current challenges in data-driven RUL prediction for rotating machinery. The challenges revolve around the accuracy and uncertainty quantification of the prediction, and the non-stationarity of the system degradation and RUL estimation given sensor data. We devise a novel computational architecture and RUL prediction model with uncertainty quantification, termed VisPro, which integrates time–frequency analysis, deep learning image recognition, and nonstationary Gaussian process regression. We analyze and benchmark the results obtained with our model against those of other advanced data-driven RUL prediction models using the PHM12 bearing vibration dataset. The computational experiments show that (1) the VisPro predictions are highly accurate and provide significant improvements over existing prediction models (three times more accurate than the second-best model), and (2) the RUL uncertainty bounds are valid and informative.

"Transforming service sectors with IoT, ML, and comprehensive security solutions This chapter explores the transformative influence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and connected devices on the service sector, unravelling the profound implications for operational efficiency, customer experiences, and the evolution of innovative service models. As the service industry undergoes a paradigm shift, this abstract provides a concise overview of key themes addressed in this chapter. This chapter mainly focuses on four major areas including operational efficiency, enhanced customer experience, innovative service model, and security privacy consideration. Operational efficiency focuses on remote monitoring, predictive maintenance, asset tracking, and energy management. The proposed architecture has been explained in detail for product monitoring, predictive analysis, and asset tracking. It gives the best outline to improve the performance. In the enhanced customer experience, two major things have been highlighted in this chapter: IoT and its impact on customer experience in the service sector and smart environment and its impact on customer experience. By leveraging smart environments and technologies, businesses can create a more seamless, efficient, and personalized customer experience, leading to increased satisfaction, loyalty, and advocacy. In the innovative service model, the mechanism of subscription-based and pay-per-use-based model has been presented and explained in detail. However, with a subscription model, a vendor provides you with the set price tiers, which are closed for the term of minimum interval of time. Pay-as-you-go is another thing that works in cooperation with subscriptions as a way of customers scrutinizing the services before paying the fee and paying only for what they have actually used. It is called usage-based or consumption-based. The design of both models has been thoroughly described in this chapter. Security and privacy are paramount for the Internet-of-Thing devices in the services infrastructure. These treasures store private data and are connected to one another, which makes them a likely target for hackers. Moreover, the usage of the same practice had not only security but also privacy dimension explained in depth.

"Research on dual-threshold detection based adaptive fault-tolerant kalman filtering algorithm for dynamic 6-DOF measurement To improve the performance of dynamic six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) measurement and overcome the limitations in terms of dynamic inaccuracy, signal unavailability and error accumulation for large-scale metrology (LSM). A hybrid LT/PMTS/SINS 6-DOF measurement system is constructed and a dual-threshold adaptive fault-tolerant kalman filtering algorithm (DTAFTKF) composed of four modules (DFDM, D-RBFNN ECM, CFDM, AFM) working in a tightly coupled mode is proposed as the fault-tolerant multi-sensor fusion scheme. In the proposed scheme, a dual-threshold detection structure is formed by constructing an LSSVR-based fault detection algorithm combined with residual chi-square (RCS) test, and a dynamic-RBFNN (D-RBFNN) network is proposed to predict and compensate for the system pose error during fault durations when the fault detection value exceeds the high threshold. Moreover, a filtering system covariance adaptive adjustment algorithm based on covariance adjustment factor (CAF) is studied to improve the fault tolerance capacity and estimation accuracy when the fault detection value is at the middle threshold. Finally, experiments under different dynamic motions are carried out. The experimental results verified that based on the proposed method, the LT/PMTS/SINS system is capable of providing accurate and stable estimates of 6-DOF pose under various dynamic conditions with the maximum angular error below 0.047 ° and maximum positional error below 0.35 mm, which showed significant improvement compared to other comparative methods. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85184069482
"Investigation on Feature Attribution for Remaining Useful Life Prediction Model of Cryogenic Ball Bearing This paper investigates the feature attribution in remaining useful life (RUL) prediction model of cryogenic ball bearing. The RUL prediction model is constructed based on artificial neural network (ANN) by using the TensorFlow platform for training the degradation curve of bearing. To train the models, 5 run-to-failure (RTF) data of cryogenic ball bearings were used. The experiment was driven to 3,600rpm with 20kN axial load and 2.5kN radial load for accelerated life test (ALT) of bearing. 6 sensor data (motor input current, bearing outer race torque, test bearing temperature, and support bearing top and bottom temperature) were used in each case. Before training, min-max scaler was used to avoid biased toward a specific range of values. The model has 3 hidden layers with 0.25 dropout for each. Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and Root mean square error (RMSE) were used for evaluating the model. By applying SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), it was confirmed that the current is the most attributing feature for the RUL prediction model, then the torque.

"Crack detection and localization in a fluid pipeline based on acoustic emission signals This paper introduces a novel approach to crack detection and localization in a pipeline transporting fluid under high pressure. From acoustic emission signals acquired by two R15i-AST sensors at two ends of a fluid pipeline, the proposed method scans peaks in the individual signal channels in the time-frequency domain and filters out noise to obtain acoustic emission events. Subsequently, adjacent events are combined into grouped events, and these are picked and paired together on two sensor channels to localize emission sources using the time difference of arrival technique. To improve the location accuracy, the mechanism only determines the arrival time of Rayleigh waves with a similar frequency in event pairs. Furthermore, the Rayleigh wave velocity is calibrated by a pencil lead breaking procedure. Additionally, false emission sources are eliminated by considering the wave energy attenuation characteristics in their propagation path. After locating the emission sources, the approach observes their distribution according to the position and time of occurrence. The variation in acoustic emission activity against applied load, which is established by counting the returned sources, can indicate irregular structural changes in a material. The location of the structural change can be surmised by the emission source distribution and density according to the position along the pipeline. Experimental results show that the proposed method correctly diagnoses faults in the considered pipeline from acoustic emission signals, whereas a conventional approach (performed by detecting hits with a threshold) inaccurately localizes acoustic emission sources and imprecisely exposes signs of abnormal structural transformations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85090420451
"Principal component analysis approach for detecting faults in rotary machines based on vibrational and electrical fused data Rotating machines are frequently used in industrial applications. However, due to their severity, mechanical failures such as rotor imbalance, shaft imbalance, pulley imbalance, structural breakage, and bearing imbalance can lead to unplanned shutdowns. While vibration analysis-based condition monitoring techniques can detect and diagnose many early errors, certain mechanical faults have associated vibration characteristics that make it difficult to identify and distinguish these faults. To address this issue, this paper proposes a method based on data fusion for vibrational and electrical signatures to achieve new fused signatures for healthy and different faulty cases. The weighted decision fusion method generates the fused decision by weighting and combining the output of multiple sensors. Conventional vibration evaluation parameters diagnose unbalance, pulley misalignment, belt damage, and combined faults. However, these parameters have more dimensions and correlated features for some faulty cases, such as unbalance and misalignment. Therefore, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the dimensionality of evaluating parameters and preserve almost all data variation. The PCA produces uncorrelated Principal Components (PCs) for each case. A backpropagation neural network (BPNN) was constructed to construct an integrated fault diagnosis framework. The first and second PC was inserted as input parameters in the training set of BPNN. It was observed that BPNN achieves 2.1762×10-10 Mean Squared Error (MSE) demonstrates superior data fusion solutions and PCA in the condition monitoring of rotating machines. Overall, this study proposes an effective method for diagnosing mechanical faults in rotating machines, which can improve reliability and reduce downtime in industrial applications. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85164238079
"An information fusion-based meta transfer learning method for few-shot fault diagnosis under varying operating conditions In recent years, meta-learning has gained increasing attention in the field of fault diagnosis due to its advantages of handling small samples and exhibiting fast adaptation across different diagnostic tasks. However, the scenario of sharply varying operating conditions and the heavy computation burden still limit the effective application of meta-learning in the field of transfer fault diagnosis. To address the above challenges, a few-shot meta transfer diagnosis method is proposed based on information fusion-based model agnostic meta-learning (IFMAML). Firstly, the information enhancement method based on sparse principal component analysis is introduced to enhance the domain invariant features and reduce data redundancy. Subsequently, the information fusion strategy of multiple sensor data is proposed to form the red, green, and blue (RGB) channel information of images, which can enrich the diversity of domain invariant features and mine the spatial information of multiple sensors. Then, the IFMAML, with its enhanced potential for diagnostic performance and computational efficiency, is developed to address the challenging few-shot cross-domain transfer diagnosis under varying operating conditions. Finally, two case studies for gearbox fault diagnostics considering sharply varying speed conditions and unknown health conditions have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. Experimental results have indicated that the proposed IFMAML method can achieve superior diagnostic accuracy and can be quickly adapted to new transfer diagnosis scenarios under varying operating conditions, when compared with several mainstream meta-learning methods. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85196424261
"Measurement of micro-harmonic vibration frequency from the modulated self-mixed interferometric signal using dynamic time warping method The vibration frequency is one of the key factors that contains vital information about the subjects/machines and offers major analytical support. The contactless measurement of vibration frequency is the crucial requirement of many industrial, scientific, and biomedical applications like predictive maintenance, non-destructive testing, and reverse engineering, chest vibration, etc. The paper presents a self-mixed optical feedback interferometry (SM-OFI) sensor to measure the vibration frequency of the micro-harmonic vibrating surface. The method employs a Dynamic Time Warping algorithm (DTW) to compute the Euclidian distance between the locally generated reference signal and the SM interferometric signal obtained from a vibrating target. The method is tested experimentally on a customized SM-OFI emitting a wavelength of 650 nm under weak feedback conditions. The proposed method was able to measure the unknown frequency with 98% accuracy in all sets of experiments. The method also exhibits an R-squared value of 0.99 with a relative error of less than unity. The comprehensive analysis of the experimental results concludes that the proposed method provides an accurate and precise vibration frequency measurement scheme for the low bandwidth range. This low bandwidth range measurement promises a non-contact measurement in industries and biomedical applications during the COVID-19 scenario. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85120737089
"Box-cox-sparse-measures-based blind filtering: Understanding the difference between the maximum kurtosis deconvolution and the minimum entropy deconvolution Blind filtering is an emerging topic in various domains to recover an excitation from responses measured by sensors. In the existing literature, the minimum entropy deconvolution is often regarded as the maximum kurtosis deconvolution without providing an underlying connection between them. However, a recent progress towards sparsity measures has shown that kurtosis is actually different from negative entropy. Moreover, a generalized sparse measure, called Box-Cox sparse measures (BCSM), has been proposed to establish a connection between the kurtosis and the negative entropy. Thus, this research investigates an underlying connection between the minimum entropy deconvolution and the maximum kurtosis deconvolution by using the BCSM. After that, the BCSM is incorporated into a generalized Rayleigh quotient to form a generalized blind filter that extracts a signal with the sparsest envelope spectrum. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed generalized filter is verified using both simulated and real experimental bearing data. Results demonstrates that the proposed method can be used to detect multiple faults using a single measurement set. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85113602366
"Improving the sensitivity of early rub detection in rotating machines with an adaptive orthogonal filter The early detection of rotor-casing rub helps to prevent permanent damage or catastrophic failure, saves maintenance costs and decreases the downtime of rotating machines. In aeroderivative gas turbines, rub detection is possible only with the use of casing sensors such as accelerometers. In previous works, the Wavelet Synchrosqueezed Transform (WSST) was proposed for very early detection of rub in aeroderivative gas turbines with accelerometer signals. In a quest for even better detection performances, this manuscript aims to design adaptive orthogonal wavelet filter banks for optimal rub feature separation from accelerometer signals. The outputs of the adaptive filter bank show improved feature separation between the no-rub and the rub regimes within a validation set from an experimental machine. Ultimately, it is demonstrated that the combination of the WSST and the adaptive orthogonal filter outperforms other methodologies for the early detection of rotor-casing rub with accelerometer signals, also when white noise is present in the data. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85124329634
"CNN and Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) based real-time sensor fault detection, localization, and correction Increasing advances in sensing technologies and analytics have led to the proliferation of sensors to monitor structural and infrastructural systems. Accurate sensor data can provide information about structural health, aid in prognosis, and help calculate forces for vibration control. However, sensors are susceptible to faults such as loss of data, random noise, bias, drift, etc., due to the aging of sensors, defects, or environmental factors. Although traditional signal processing techniques can detect and isolate faults and reconstruct corrupt or missing sensor data, they demand significant human intervention. The continuous rise in computational power and demonstrated efficacy in numerous domains motivates the use of deep learning to minimize human-in-the-loop techniques. In this work, we introduce a novel, deep learning framework for linear systems with time-invariant parameters that identifies the presence and type of fault in sensor data, location of the faulty sensor and subsequently reconstructs the correct sensor data for fault detection, fault classification, and reconstruction. In our framework, first, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to detect the presence of a fault and identify its type. Next, a suite of individually trained Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) networks corresponding to each type of fault are employed for reconstruction. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework to address both single and multiple sensor faults in synthetically generated data of a simple shear-type structure and experimentally measured data from a simplified arch bridge. While the framework is agnostic of fault-type, we demonstrate its use for four types of fault namely, missing, spiky, random, and drift. For both simulated and experimental datasets with a single fault, our models performed well, achieving 100% accuracy in faulty sensor localization, more than 98.7% accuracy in fault type detection, and more than 99% accuracy in reconstruction. Our framework can also address multiple concurrent faults with similar accuracy. We empirically demonstrate that our proposed framework performs better than other state-of-the-art techniques in terms of computational efficiency with comparable accuracy.

"Fault Sensor Isolation Method for Liquid Rocket Engines Based on Multi-Model This paper presents a multiple-mode-based approach for sensor fault isolation in liquid rocket engines. The approach comprises a “two-step” precise model identification technique and a particle filter bank-based sensor fault isolation strategy. By leveraging the “two-step” precise model identification process, this approach effectively addresses the challenges associated with inaccurate modeling in traditional model-based sensor fault diagnosis methods. Moreover, the particle filter bank-based strategy facilitates the accurate identification and isolation of faulty sensors. The “two-step” method integrates subspace model identification method with forecast error detection. Initially, the subspace identification technique estimates the engine's coefficient matrix to produce a preliminary model. Subsequently, the prediction error method refines and corrects the coefficient matrix, yielding an accurate system model. Once the system model is established, a series of particle filters are constructed based on this model, with each filter specifically tailored to an individual sensor. In the event of a sensor failure, only the particle filter designed for that particular sensor remains unaffected, enabling effective fault isolation through residual analysis. The algorithm's performance is thoroughly evaluated using both simulation data from the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) and experimental data from the SSME fuel flow path simulation test bench. These evaluations demonstrate the robustness of the approach under various operating conditions and confirm its applicability in real-world scenarios. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85214344933
"Privacy-preserving and sensor-fused framework for prognostic & health management in leased manufacturing system Nowadays, increased investments and fierce competition have made the leased manufacturing paradigm being widely adopted. Advances in multi-sensor technologies and data-driven methodologies have also supported the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to focus on outsourcing prognostic and health management (PHM) services for the leased manufacturing system. However, under this product-service paradigm, the degraded-related signal analysis for massive sensors of leased machines is always limited by privacy concerns, fusion lack, and varying correlation. To promote the security performance and analysis capability of PHM from the OEM to the lessee, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving and sensor-fused framework to achieve time-to-failure (TTF) updating and predictive maintenance (PdM) arrangement for the leased manufacturing system. We first aggregate degraded-related historical datasets through encrypted functional features to preserve the privacy signals of two parties. Next, informative sensors of each leased machine are identified by the penalized functional (log)-location-scale (LLS) regression, while keeping the signals private. Then, the real-time observed signals from the identified sensors on the lessee side are locally fused and cryptographically uploaded to the OEM for the adaptive functional LLS regression. The TTF distributions can thus be securely updated in real time and integrated to output PdM intervals for each leased machine. We further validate our privacy-preserving and sensor-fused framework on a real leased crankshaft manufacturing system, which shows our secure mechanism and fused prognostic can significantly ensure privacy protection, computational performance, fusion effectiveness, and PdM cost reduction. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85136474472
"A comparative study on deep learning models for condition monitoring of advanced reactor piping systems Advanced nuclear reactors offer innovative applications due to their portability, reliability, resiliency, and high capacity factors. To operate them on a wider scale, reducing maintenance life-cycle costs while ensuring their integrity is essential. Autonomous operations in advanced nuclear reactors using augmented Digital Twin (DT) technology can serve as a cost-effective solution by increasing awareness about the system's health. A key component of nuclear DT frameworks is the condition monitoring of safety systems, such as piping-equipment systems, which involves acquiring and monitoring the plant's sensor data. This research proposes a condition monitoring methodology utilizing deep learning algorithms, such as multilayer perceptions (MLP) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to detect degradation and its severity in nuclear piping-equipment systems. Sensor signals are processed to obtain the power spectral density and the Short-Time Fourier transform, and feature extraction methodologies are proposed to develop degradation-sensitive data repositories. The performance of MLP, one-dimensional (1D) CNN, and 2D CNN within the proposed condition monitoring framework is compared using a finite element model of a 3D piping system subjected to seismic loads as the application case study. Various approaches, such as dropout, k-Fold validation, regularization, and early stopping of training the network, are investigated to avoid overfitting the models to the input sensor data. The predictive capability and computational capacity of the deep learning algorithms are also compared to detect degradation in the Z-pipe system of the Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBRII). The Z-pipe system is subjected to harmonic excitations that represent normal operating loads, such as pump-induced vibrations. The findings of the study indicate that the proposed artificial intelligence (AI)-driven condition monitoring framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracies with a 2D CNN, whereas the MLP exhibits higher computational efficiency. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85182516202
"Intelligent triboelectric V-belts with condition monitoring capability In this study, the V-belt transmission structure and triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) are combined, and an intelligent transmission system, the triboelectric V-belt (TVB), is proposed. Furthermore, its condition-monitoring capability is investigated to improve the intelligence level of the traditional mechanical transmission system. The designed TVB can be integrated with a belt pulley without additional structural space; moreover, it exhibits good reliability by avoiding contact with the working surface of the V-belt transmission. For the output characteristics of the TVB, the variation curves of the output voltage and current with load resistance were tested and the influence of several design variables was elucidated. Through monitoring the amplitude and time–frequency features of the TVB output current, the slipping failure of the V-belt drive can be detected in time, and typical faults of a bevel gearbox (including defective driving/driven gears and supporting bearings) were classified with an average accuracy exceeding 90%. The classification accuracy based on TVB was only slightly lower than that based on the vibration sensor. The designed TVB exhibits promising application prospects for monitoring industrial transmission systems. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85182391604
"Experimental study on in-situ internal stress monitoring of full-size water-lubricated journal bearings by embedded fibre Bragg gratings Real-time stress evolution inner water-lubricated bearings (WLBs) in service time is unaware due to its installation position and harsh surroundings on ship, which will be of vital importance for identifying bearing fault such as abnormal wear or frictional noise. In this work, we present an embeddable sensor based on fibre Bragg gratings (FBGs) and applicate it for bearing internal stress characterization. The developed sensor shows excellent sensing accuracy and repeatability. Integrating FBG sensors into a full-size WLB achieves the in-situ static and dynamic stress monitoring in test rig experiments. Stress distribution along bearing axis was revealed. Dynamic stress inner bottom lining was recorded and analyzed during running-in, pulse excitation, load or rotary speed tests as well as start-up/stop experiments. The outcome indicates that FBG sensors are able to readily detect external impact on shaft and nicely monitor stress variation inner bearing lining. Averaged stress and its variation amplitude reduce with shaft speed rising. It is also interesting to note that the periodically dynamic stress in lining is consistent with shaft speed, which can even reflect shaft speeding up/down. This study provides a novel strategy of utilizing FBG for status monitoring and fault diagnose of WLBs. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85200475511
"Intelligent bearing fault diagnosis method combining mixed input and hybrid CNN-MLP model Rolling bearings are one of the most widely used bearings in industrial machines. The technical condition of the rolling bearings has a significant impact on the total condition of rotating machinery. Typically, the rolling bearing condition monitoring is based on signal processing from accelerometers mounted on the machine housing. AI-based signal processing methods allow achieving high results in the diagnosis of rolling bearings. Moreover, hybrid NN-based signal processing methods provide the best diagnostic results. However, the diagnostic value of each signal from the housing-mounted accelerometers is highly depend on the location of the corresponding accelerometer. On the other hand, mounting a sensor on the rotating shaft allows expanding and increasing the signal diagnostic value. This paper proposes a novel hybrid CNN-MLP model-based diagnostic method which combines mixed input to perform rolling bearing diagnostics. The method successfully detects and localizes bearing defects using acceleration data from a wireless acceleration sensor which is mounted on a rotating shaft of the machine. The detection and localization efficiency of the hybrid model with various size datasets (more than 27 k samples and about 1900 samples) for training was estimated. Moreover, the detection and localization efficiency of the trained hybrid model with a dataset of another shaft rotating speed for testing was estimated. The experimental results show that applying the hybrid model allows detecting and localizing the bearing faults with up to 99.6% accuracy. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85133783657
"Observer-Based Fault Detection System for a Class of Industrial Process Implemented with MQTT Protocol Fault detection systems supporting industrial safety and reliability are essential for increasing the performance and cost-effectiveness of the process. In the case of automatic control, a traditional way is to improve the reliability of the individual components of the system, such as sensors and actuators. Although currently data-driven approaches are very popular, the data availability is not completely guaranteed. On the other hand, the mathematical model of some technical processes is friendly to develop. In this case, observer-based approaches are suitable to generate residual signals stating the existence of faults. Under certain conditions, fault diagnosis is also possible. Additionally, with the growing of Industry 4.0, MQTT is currently one of the most used protocols for implementing IIoT applications. This paper tackles the problem of a very common industrial process related to the level control of cascade tanks. This class of process is highly available in the chemical, food, pharmaceutical industries, water distribution systems, and usually its mathematical model is easy to configure. In our study, the model was configured according to the characteristic of the physical prototype available in our laboratory, to simulate seven faults in sensors, actuator, tanks, and valves. All the faults were modelled, and a bank of observers-based filters were designed to detect and diagnose all the seven faults through the residual signals. A real scenario of real time processing was simulated by deploying the time-discrete version of the fault diagnostic system in a software application implemented under MQTT protocol. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",2-s2.0-85195556048
"Graph neural networks for virtual sensing in complex systems: Addressing heterogeneous temporal dynamics Real-time condition monitoring is crucial for the reliable and efficient operation of complex systems. However, relying solely on physical sensors can be limited due to their cost, placement constraints, or inability to directly measure certain critical parameters. Virtual sensing addresses these limitations by leveraging readily available sensor data and system knowledge to estimate inaccessible parameters or infer system states. The increasing complexity of industrial systems necessitates deployments of sensors with diverse modalities to provide a comprehensive understanding of system states. These sensors capture data at varying frequencies to monitor both rapid and slowly varying system dynamics, as well as local and global state evolutions of the systems. However, this leads to heterogeneous temporal dynamics, which, particularly under varying operating conditions, pose a significant challenge for accurate virtual sensing. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Temporal Graph Neural Network (HTGNN) framework for virtual sensing. HTGNN explicitly models signals from diverse sensors as distinct node types within a graph structure, enabling the capture of complex relationships between sensors. Additionally, HTGNN integrates context from operating conditions, derived from exogenous variables such as control settings and external environmental factors into the model architecture. This integration allows HTGNN to adapt to diverse operating and environmental conditions, ensuring accurate and robust virtual sensing. We evaluate the effectiveness of HTGNN using two newly released, publicly available datasets: a test-rig bearing dataset with diverse load conditions for bearing load prediction and a comprehensive year-long simulated dataset for train–bridge–track interaction, aimed at predicting bridge live loads. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that HTGNN significantly outperforms established baseline methods in both bearing and bridge load prediction tasks, particularly under highly varying operating conditions. These results highlight HTGNN's potential as a robust and accurate virtual sensing approach for complex systems, paving the way for improved monitoring, predictive maintenance, and enhanced system performance.

"SGAD-GAN: Simultaneous Generation and Anomaly Detection for time-series sensor data with Generative Adversarial Networks In recent years, mechanical sensor data anomaly detection has gained much attention in the machine learning and mechanical fault warning fields. Limited by the fact that there is far less anomalous data available for analysis than normal data, many machine learning methods fail to perform excellent detection results. In this paper, we propose a novel Simultaneous Generation and Anomaly Detection with Generative Adversarial Networks (SGAD-GAN) framework to tackle the challenge of anomaly detection under imbalanced datasets. In our framework, the generators accomplish transfer between sensor signals while synthesizing realistic data. In addition to the regular discriminators for identifying the authenticity of samples, we design a classification discriminator to facilitate data synthesis in the direction benefitting anomaly detection, which is trained to act as an anomaly detector in an identical way as other discriminators. We conduct extensive data synthesis and anomaly detection experiments on Hydraulic System Sensor (HSS) data from the Jiaolong deep-sea manned submersible, and show the generalization ability of our approach to different application domains on the public dataset KDDCUP99.

"Multistate fault diagnosis strategy for bearings based on an improved convolutional sparse coding with priori periodic filter group Bearings are a critical component of rotating machines; when they fail, critical equipment becomes unavailable, damage may occur beyond the bearing itself, and safety concerns arise. Determining that a bearing structure is compromised before catastrophic failure permits the protection of plant, people, and productivity. When bearings malfunction, the features of single and multiple faults are masked and accompanied by noise and other signal degrading artifacts affecting the signals from the vibrational sensors. In these circumstances, detection and diagnosis of multistate bearing faults is difficult. To overcome these challenges, an improved convolutional sparse coding (ICSC) model, based on a priori periodic filter groups (PPFG), is proposed to respond to the multistate fault problems of bearings. A Laplace wavelet is constructed with one-sided decay related to the vibration pattern of the signal. The best-matched wavelet is optimally determined by correlation analysis of the signal frequency domain parameters and the time domain damping parameters. The best-matched wavelet and the kurtosis criterion are used to construct a PPFG based on the theoretical period of the fault. The ICSC based on the PPFG obtains mapping coefficients characterizing different vibrational features of the signal. The envelope spectrum analysis of the various mapping coefficients identifies and confirms the fault-revealing components in the multistate signal. The ICSC results have a relatively good sparse time domain, and the fault-identifying features in the envelope spectrum are enhanced. Multiple faults can be easily identified. The effectiveness and robustness of the PPFG/ICSC are demonstrated through a complete experimental analysis of simulated, single-fault, and multifault signals, as well as a comparative analysis of the previous methods – Fast SK, CBPDN, and VMD-ICA – which verifies that the PPFG/ICSC is more robust, accurate, and efficient than the previous methods. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85145599624
"Proposition of a bearing diagnosis method applied to IAS and vibration signals: The BEAring Frequency Estimation Method Early detection of bearing faults has been a major topic of industrial research for several years now. Although new methods are regularly tested, accelerometry remains the most widely used because of its ease of implementation and its cost. However, the use of accelerometers reaches its limits when the background noise is very high (combustion noise, kinematic frequencies, modal response of the structure), or more prosaically when the environmental conditions do not allow instrumentation near the bearing (temperature, space available). Another disadvantage lies in the need to be as close as possible to the monitored bearing, implying the use of numerous sensors if the drive train includes several bearings. In this paper, we take advantage of the high sensitivity of incremental encoders to kinematic phenomena to detect the early appearance of a bearing fault on a helicopter drive train. First, the deterministic components related to the kinematic chain are subtracted from the signal. Then, a fault detection method which respects the kinematic coherence between the characteristic frequencies of the bearing is proposed: the BEAring Frequency Estimation Method (BEAFEM). This approach seeks to maximize the sum of the spectral components whose frequency exactly corresponds to the characteristic frequency of the bearing, by scanning each potential contact angle. It is shown that the method can be applied indifferently on IAS signals (using CS1 approach) or on vibration signals (using CS2 approach) obtained with accelerometers. Additionally, it is shown that BEAFEM provides convincing results when applied to an encoder signal located further down the kinematic chain. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85143540195

"Out-of-domain generalization for remaining useful life prediction of rotating machinery from a single source: An adversarial contrastive learning approach With the extensive sensor data provided by the Industrial Internet of Things, data-driven remaining useful life (RUL) prediction methods are crucial for enhancing equipment reliability in industrial environments. To enhance prediction accuracy under unknown operating conditions (OCs), domain adaptation and domain generalization-based RUL prediction methods have emerged. However, when only a single-source domain is available, the lack of sample diversity, coupled with significant and unpredictable domain shifts (DSs) between the source and unknown target domains, hinders the model's ability to generalize effectively to the unknown target domain. To address these challenges, a novel RUL prediction method based on adversarial contrastive learning for single-source domain generalization (ACL-SDG) under unknown OCs is proposed. First, a semantic embedding-based multi-pseudo-domain generation (SE-MPDG) module is designed, which generates diverse and valid pseudo-domain samples, guided by the developed subdomain-level supervised contrastive learning loss, subdomain continuity manifold regularization, and semantic consistency constraints to improve the model's out-of-domain generalization capability. Subsequently, a domain-invariant feature-guided RUL prediction (DIF-RP) module is proposed to alleviate DS. This module compels the feature extractor to mine domain-invariant degradation features across different domains, constrained by label-level supervised contrastive learning loss. Finally, adversarial training is conducted between the SE-MPDG and DIF-RP modules to further enhance the diversity of pseudo-domains while ensuring the cross-domain invariance of degradation features. Extensive experimental validation of single-source cross-domain RUL prediction for one practical dataset and two public datasets, under unknown OCs, demonstrates the efficacy and superiority of the proposed method. © 2025",2-s2.0-105007801931
"Data-model interactive prognosis for multi-sensor monitored stochastic degrading devices With advances in sensing and monitoring techniques, real time multi-sensor monitoring data of stochastic degrading devices has become the reality. How to effectively fuse these multi-sensor monitoring data to first construct the composite health index (CHI) and then model its degradation evolving process has become the emerging topic in the field of the remaining useful life (RUL) prediction. However, existing works treat the CHI construction and degradation modeling for prognostics under multi-sensor data as the disjoint problems rather than both though they are closely related in nature. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel data-model interactive RUL prediction method for multi-sensor monitored stochastic degrading devices. In the proposed method, based on the CHI extracted from multi-sensor historical data and the associated lifetime prediction via stochastic degradation modeling, an optimization objective function synthesizing the mean squared error between the predicted life and the actual life as well as the variance of the predicted life is constructed. As such, a closed-loop feedback mechanism is established for the CHI constructing and stochastic degradation modeling. Based on this feedback mechanism, the fusion coefficients for multi-sensor data and the failure threshold of the associated CHI are reversely optimized to realize the collaborative interaction between the CHI constructing and stochastic degradation modeling. To do so, the goal of making the constructed CHI automatically match the adopted stochastic degradation model can be achieved naturally. To make the degradation model accurately reflect the current reality of the in-service device, a sequential Bayesian method is proposed to update the degradation model parameters. Based on the updated model, the RUL distribution can be derived under the concept of the first passage time to achieve the prognosis. Finally, through multi-sensor data of aircraft gas turbine engines, we justify the necessity of applying the proposed method in prognosis and show its advantages in the improvements of the signal quality and prognosis accuracy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85118322945
"Bearing defect localization based on multiple arrivals detection via matching pursuit using single AE sensor The accurate defect localization is crucial for assessing the operational conditions of low-speed slewing bearings. The acoustic emission (AE) localization methods relay on the propagation speed and time differences of arrival (TDOA) on multiple sensors. In the circular structure of bearing, the AE signal passes by a sensor multiple times from different directions. A two-step event detection method utilizing matching pursuit is proposed to obtain multiple arrival times from one section of AE signal. Consequently, localization of bearing defects using a single AE sensor is achieved through the multiple TDOA and bypassing the wave speed. The multiple arrivals are caused by clockwise and counterclockwise propagation paths of AE signals in the bearing ring. Initially, the raw signal is filtered according to the intersection frequency of multiple propagation modes of the dispersion property. Then, two sets of sensing dictionaries are constructed according to the waveforms of the AE events to match with. By employing the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm, multiple arrival events of the AE signal are detected in a two-step procedure. The angle between the AE source and the sensor is estimated based on the derived time differences. Subsequent localization is carried out by changing the position of the sensor. The precise location of the AE source is determined by overlapping the results obtained from the two sensor positions. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated through pencil lead-breaking (PLB) tests, as well as tests on notch defect in bearing race in operational condition. © 2025",2-s2.0-105001474510
"Development of an embedded piezoelectric transducer for bearing fault detection The trend toward intelligent monitoring and industry 4.0 has attracted more attention to the performance of intelligent bearings with integrated sensors. Compared with the standard technique of mounting a sensor on the housing of machines, embedding the sensor inside the bearing housing can benefit several aspects. The short transmission path between the fault and sensor provides more efficient condition monitoring and fault detection, especially in a noisy setting or at low rotational speeds where fault symptoms have low energy. Therefore, this paper presents the design and implementation of an embedded piezoelectric transducer for fault detection in a cylindrical roller bearing. Experimental tests and simulations using ANSYS are employed to investigate the transducer performance in three different tests. The first test analyzes experimental voltage signals and a simulated transducer for a faulty outer ring and roller. Experimental tests and simulations have demonstrated that the proposed transducer can successfully detect the local fault in the bearing through obvious fault symptoms in the voltage signal. The piezoelectric transducer and accelerometer signals are analyzed in the second test by artificially exciting the bearing apparatus structure and creating noise using an air motor. In the noisy condition, the piezoelectric transducer performed better in time and frequency domain analysis than the reference accelerometer. Contrary to the accelerometer, the signal statistical indicators of the transducer remained constant during the impact, and the air motor frequency did not mask the fault symptoms. In the third test, a preliminary analysis of the transducer's durability was performed, and according to the results, the transducer was not significantly stressed under high radial loads from the shaft, which is promising for real applications. © 2022",2-s2.0-85145582441
"The flexible tensor singular value decomposition and its applications in multisensor signal fusion processing A tensor, represented as a multidimensional array, has crucial applications in various fields such as image processing and high-dimensional data mining. This study defines a novel concept of tensor-tensor multiplication, the ‘o-order 〈p, q〉-mode product’, laying a foundational framework for advanced tensor operations. Building on this, a novel extension of matrix SVD to tensors, termed the flexible tensor SVD (FTSVD), is also proposed.

"Reciprocating Compressor Fault Diagnosis Based on Airborne Acoustic Signal: Comparison Study Between Modulation Signal Bi-spectrum and Teager Energy Spectrum Method Reciprocating air compressors are the one of the most complex machines in industrial application that involves a number of rotating and reciprocating parts. Maintenance and proper fault diagnosis of these machines are quite important. Airborne acoustic analysis can be a very good choice due to the less number of sensors associated with it, making it a cost effective method and also having a wide dynamic range, the microphones can record more detailed information compared to the other traditional methods. The acoustic signals of the compressor are nonstationary. The non-linear properties of the valve fluttering, fluid-mechanical interaction, resonance due to the turbulence flow through pipe and a huge background noise make it difficult to analyse the acoustic signals for detection of compressor faults. Depending on the nature of the acoustic signals obtained from a compressor two methods have been found to be very affective from the previous study.

"Passive detection in water pipelines using ambient noise II: Field experiments A passive detection method has been proposed in a prior paper to extract key parameters and detect faults using the ambient noise present in water pipeline networks. This paper presents field experiments and data processing results to provide systematic experimental validation of this method. Field experiments were carried out in operational water pipeline networks at the University of Canterbury campus and the Waimakariri District, New Zealand, during which ambient noise was measured by pairs of pressure sensors installed at selected hydrants on pipelines of different materials, network topologies and simulated faults. Auto-correlation and cross-correlation analysis of noise at a single sensor and sensor pairs were carried out to estimate the wave speed and to locate faults in the networks. Data processing results indicate that water usage generating pressure transients are the dominant sources of ambient noise in operational water pipeline networks.

"TCRNN: A Cross-domain Knowledge Transfer Acoustic Bearing Fault Diagnosis Method for Data Unbalance Issue It is a non-contact method to diagnose axle box bearing health with the acoustic signal obtained by an acoustic sensor. However, in practice, the acoustic data collected can degrade the diagnostic performance due to data unbalance. At the same time, it is difficult to be applied the deep learning-based fault diagnosis model in reality, due to the lack of bearing acoustic dataset for training.

More specifically, the diagnostic knowledge from faulty bearing vibration data is transferred to a classifier network based on the bearing acoustic dataset, thus enhancing the diagnostic capability of the acoustic data-based fault diagnosis model under the data unbalance. The Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) is first trained in the source domain using a public bearing vibration dataset. Then, the trained network parameters are frozen and are used to transfer the fault diagnosis knowledge from the bearing vibration data. Finally, the frozen network is fine-tuned with an unbalanced acoustic dataset in the target domain.

"Nonlinear weight learning model for incipient fault detection and degradation modelling and its interpretability for fault diagnosis Optimization-based weight learning approaches that incorporate multiple sensor signals or vibration spectral components have demonstrated their effectiveness in monitoring mechanical systems. However, the current weight learning methods are limited by their reliance on linear fusion functions. The exploration of nonlinear link functions, particularly in the context of fusing spectral components in vibration spectra for health indices (HIs) construction, remains largely unexplored. Additionally, the development of formulas for interpreting HIs constructed using nonlinear fusion functions poses significant theoretical challenges. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel nonlinear optimization-based weight learning model for constructing an HI that captures the nonlinear relationships among spectral components. This HI is designed to pinpoint fault characteristic frequencies while also highlighting other spectral lines associated with bearing degradation modelling. Furthermore, we derive formulas that enable the calculation of the contributions of frequency components to nonlinearly constructed HIs, thereby enhancing the interpretability of the model. By selecting an appropriate kernel function, subtle changes resulting from incipient faults and the underlying degradation process can be effectively captured. The effectiveness of the proposed model in detecting incipient faults, modelling degradation, and identifying fault types is validated through two run-to-failure case studies and a gearbox bearing experiment. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85186478425
"An ultrasensitive self-powered smart bearing pedestal with fault locating capability For bearing condition monitoring, commonly used measuring points on the casing suffer from low signal-to-noise ratios and strong interference. These issues are expected to be addressed through embedded wireless sensors. To tackle the challenges faced by wireless sensor nodes in terms of energy supply and to enhance their intelligence level, this paper proposes a self-powered smart bearing pedestal with ultrasensitive sensing capabilities. The proposed bearing pedestal features a segmented arrangement of piezoelectric stacks integrated into the structure, utilizing the varying contact load generated by rolling elements.

"High-precision bearing signal recovery based on signal fusion and variable stepsize forward-backward pursuit In multi-sensor, long-distance fault monitoring of rolling bearings, the bearing signals are compressively sampled, transmitted, and reconstructed according to the theory of compressive sensing. However, the reconstruction accuracy and speed are limited and are affected by the noise afflicting the collected signals. In this paper, a high-precision signal recovery method, based on signal fusion and the variable stepsize forward–backward pursuit (VSFBP) algorithm, is proposed. First, the method adaptively adjusts the best estimate of the traditional random weighted fusion algorithm, by using the relative fluctuation value, which can fuse variable signals and reduce the noise component of the detection signal. Second, two fuzzy parameters are used to control the step sizes of the atom selection and deletion in the two-stage matching pursuit algorithm; this improves the reconstruction accuracy and speed of the algorithm under a high compression ratio. Finally, to prevent excessive backtracking, in the two-stage matching pursuit algorithm, the observation matrix is updated after each iteration, which improves the reconstruction accuracy of the algorithm further.

With advancements in data transmission and sensor technology, measurement systems can now gather vast amounts of data from multiple sensors. These multi-sensor datasets are multivariate time series with significant Spatial–temporal correlation. Utilizing this correlation to achieve accurate diagnostics is a significant challenge. To fully leverage the Spatial–temporal correlations, especially the correlations among different sensors at various time steps, we propose a new, richly connected Spatial–temporal graph neural network for diagnosing faults in rotating machinery. This network primarily comprises two modules: graph construction and graph diffusion convolution with pooling. The graph construction module initially builds a richly connected graph that considers both the connections among sensors at the same time step and the connections between sensors across different time steps. Subsequently, we design a attenuation matrix that takes into account temporal distances to adjust the connection strengths between sensors based on their time separation. By applying Graph Diffusion Convolution (GDC) on the constructed graph, information can be propagated among nodes within a broader neighborhood, even capturing the interactions between nodes across multiple time steps. By combining GDC with pooling operations, temporal and spatial dependencies can be effectively captured to learn efficient representations. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach through comparative experiments on three datasets, challenging various methods. The results demonstrate our method's superior capability in integrating Spatial–temporal features thoroughly. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85212419984
"Zero-shot motor health monitoring by blind domain transition Continuous long-term monitoring of motor health is crucial for the early detection of abnormalities such as bearing faults (up to 51% of motor failures are attributed to bearing faults). Despite numerous methodologies proposed for bearing fault detection, most of them require normal (healthy) and abnormal (faulty) data for training. Even with the recent deep learning (DL) methodologies trained on the labeled data from the same machine, the classification accuracy significantly deteriorates when one or few conditions are altered, e.g., a different speed or load, or for different fault types/severities with sensors placed in different locations. Furthermore, their performance suffers significantly or may entirely fail when they are tested on another machine with entirely different healthy and faulty signal patterns. To address this need, in this pilot study, we propose a zero-shot bearing fault detection method that can detect any fault on a new (target) machine regardless of the working conditions, sensor parameters, or fault characteristics. To accomplish this objective, a 1D Operational Generative Adversarial Network (Op-GAN) first characterizes the transition between normal and fault vibration signals of (a) source machine(s) under various conditions, sensor parameters, and fault types. Then for a target machine, the potential faulty signals can be generated, and over its actual healthy and synthesized faulty signals, a compact, and lightweight 1D Self-ONN fault detector can then be trained to detect the real faulty condition in real time whenever it occurs. To validate the proposed approach, a new benchmark dataset is created using two different motors working under different conditions and sensor locations. Experimental results demonstrate that this novel approach can accurately detect any bearing fault achieving an average recall rate of around 89% and 95% on two target machines regardless of its type, severity, and location. © 2024 The Authors",2-s2.0-85183455115
"Strain virtual sensor for offshore wind turbine jacket supports: A time series transformer approach validated with Alpha Ventus wind farm data Monitoring the structural health of offshore wind turbines in harsh marine environments presents significant challenges due to physical sensor limitations, such as susceptibility to high salinity, strong underwater currents, and the resulting durability and maintenance issues. These challenges increase the need for robust and cost-effective alternatives. Motivated by the urgent demand for sustainable and reliable solutions in offshore wind energy, this study introduces a virtual strain sensor based on the PatchTST architecture, a time series transformer designed to capture local and global patterns in multivariate data. By addressing the limitations of conventional physical sensors, the proposed approach uses advanced deep learning techniques to estimate strain accurately in wind turbine jacket supports. The method involves pre-training the model with self-supervised learning and fine-tuning it using real-world strain data from the Alpha Ventus offshore wind farm. Extensive evaluations using statistical metrics (Pearson correlation, root mean square error) and mechanics-based metrics (normalized fatigue damage error and equivalent strain range) demonstrate the virtual sensor's superior predictive capabilities. Key results reveal that the model outperforms conventional approaches in reliability, adaptability, and computational efficiency, offering an innovative tool for improving structural health monitoring systems. These outcomes support the deployment of virtual sensors as a durable, cost-effective alternative to physical sensors, contributing to enhanced sustainability and efficiency in offshore wind energy systems. © 2025 The Authors",2-s2.0-105001841785
"Perception modelling by invariant representation of deep learning for automated structural diagnostic in aircraft maintenance: A study case using DeepSHM Predictive maintenance, as one of the core components of Industry 4.0, takes a proactive approach to maintain machines and systems in good order to keep downtime to a minimum and the airline maintenance industry is not an exception to this. To achieve this goal, practices in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) complement the existing Non-Destructive-Testing (NDT) have been established in the last decades. Recently, the increasing computational capability such as utilization of a graphical processing unit (GPU) in combination with advanced machine learning techniques such as deep learning has been one of the main drivers in the advancement of predictive analytics in condition monitoring. In our previous work, we proposed a novel approach using deep learning for guided wave based structural health called DeepSHM. As a study case, we treated an ultrasonic signal from guided Lamb wave SHM with a convolutional neural network (CNN). In that work, we only considered a single central frequency excitation. This led to a single governing wavelength which is normally good for the detection of a single damage size. In classical signal processing, applying a broader excitation frequency poses an analysis and interpretation nightmare because it contains more complex information and thus is difficult to understand. This problem can be overcome with deep learning; however, it creates another problem: while deep learning typically results in a more accurate result prediction, it is specifically made for solving only certain types of tasks. While many papers have already introduced deep learning for diagnostics, many of these works are only proposing novel predictive techniques, however the mathematical formalization is lacking, and we are not informed about why we should treat acoustic signal with deep learning. So, the basis of ‘explainable AI’ for SHM and NDT is currently lacking. For this reason, in this paper, we would like to extend our previous work into a more generalized. Rather than focusing on a novel technique, we propose a plausible theoretical perspective inspired from neuroscience for signal representation of deep learning framework to model machine perception in structural health monitoring (SHM), especially because SHM typically involves multiple sensory input from different sensing locations. To do this, we created a set of artificial data from a finite element model (FEM) and represented DeepSHM in two different ways: 1). Perpetual representation of observation and 2). Hierarchical structure of entities that is decomposable in a smaller sub-entity. Consequently, we assume two plausible models for DeepSHM: 1). Either it behaves as a single deciding actor since the observation is regarded as perpetual, and 2). Or it acts as a multiple actor with independent outputs since multiple sensors can form different output probabilities. These artificial data were split into several different input representations, classified into several damage scenarios and then trained with commonly used deep learning training parameters. We compare the performance metrics of each perception model to describe the training behavior of both representations. © 2021 The Author(s)",2-s2.0-85111830405
"Local Embedded Sensing-Based Gear Fault Diagnosis Under Speed Varying Condition The external signals of the gearbox sensed by the sensors are always affected by structural noise interference and path-transfer attenuation, and this would cause the fault characteristics cannot be effectively identified. Especially, those desired features would be further interfered by variable speed conditions. Focusing on these issues, this study introduced a diagnostic enhancement method via local embedded sensing (LES) system, where a vibration acceleration sensor is directly embedded in the rotational position to sense the internal excitation and response. Different from the conventional approach of external sensing system, two physical information, including vibration and speed, can be simultaneously sensed. Thereupon, a fault diagnosis method based on order analysis is later processed for the local embedded signal of gear. This diagnostic enhancement method for variable speed conditions mainly contains three steps. First, according to the characteristics of local embedded sensing signals, low-pass and high-pass digital filters are used to separate the low-frequency speed component and the high-frequency component. Then, the Hilbert transform is performed on the low-frequency speed component to get the phase curve, and then the least squares method is used to fit the phase curve to obtain the fitting phase curve. Finally, the angular domain of the high-frequency vibration signal is resampled by fitting the phase curve, and then the envelope order of the resampled angular domain signal is analyzed to extract the fault characteristics of the signal. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been verified by simulation analysis of local embedded signal of the gear. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",2-s2.0-85195609859
"A Comparative Study of Acoustic and Vibration Signals for Bearing Fault Detection and Diagnosis Based on MSB Analysis Bearing is of a crucial part/element of all rotating machines. The main purpose of the rolling element in any rotating machine is to maintain rotating parts in their correct arrangement relative to stationary parts when under the action of radial and axial loads. The centrifugal pump is generally used to transfer fluid from one place to another and early detection of bearing faults allows proper action to be taken to maintain and/or improve performance and reduce lifetime cost. The focus of this study is to enhance the condition monitoring of the bearings in centrifugal pumps. The airborne sound signature and its remote measurement and analysis does away with the need to mount additional sensors as is the case of surface vibration measurement. However, a serious difficulty in detecting and diagnosing machine faults via traditional approaches is the high level of background noise, particularly with airborne sound signals. Thus, here the modulation signal bispectrum (MSB) which has ability to substantially reduce noise and detect nonlinear components has been used. The results obtained show that the MSB applied to airborne sound and the vibration signatures enhances detection and diagnosis of outer race bearing faults. Also, for detecting inner race defects, the results show that the diagnostic features obtained applying the MSB to the acoustic signal are more accurate and show a better separation between healthy and faulty cases than those obtained using the vibration signal. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85106039424
"Hybrid fault diagnosis method for underwater thrusters based on the common features of multi-source signals Integrating the motor and driver into the confined space of an underwater thruster's sealed shell can lead to current sensor failures, primarily due to high temperatures, pressures, and electromagnetic interference. Despite progress in distinguishing sensor malfunctions from propeller issues, a significant gap exists in understanding simultaneous sensor and propeller failures. This study addresses this by thoroughly analyzing the propeller's condition during sensor failure. We introduce two virtual sensors, ingeniously derived from the motor's voltage and mechanical model, to estimate the thruster's current from different perspectives and effectively separate sensor and propeller faults. Recognizing the potential discrepancies between the virtual and real sensors, we developed a multi-source signal common features extractor inspired by transfer learning. This extractor obtains common features from measured and estimated currents, leveraging these variations to detect and assess faults accurately. The effectiveness of this approach has been corroborated through simulation and experiment, demonstrating the ability to distinguish between sensor and propeller faults and accurately evaluate the system's status. © 2024",2-s2.0-85200159683
"Reinforcement Learning Fault Diagnosis Method Based on Less Tag Data Vibration signals are often used in the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. However, due to the influence of complex environment, environmental noise is often doped, and the diagnostic accuracy is reduced. The traditional deep self-encoder is used in the noise reduction process of rotating machinery fault diagnosis. The pooling model is poor and easy to lead to over-fitting problems, and deep learning training needs a large number of labeled data. Therefore, this paper proposes a reinforcement learning fault diagnosis method based on less label data. The random pooling is used to replace the pooling layer of the original convolutional self-encoder, and the exponential linear unit (ELU) is used to replace the original activation function to enhance the convolutional self-encoder. A large number of unlabeled samples are used for training, and then the deep reinforcement learning is used for network fine tuning. The experimental results of the sensor data collected by the fault diagnosis test bench show that the method used has a good improvement in denoising ability and feature extraction ability, and the recognition accuracy and stability are better than traditional convolutional autoencoder and traditional machine learning methods. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85138777403
"Vision-based fringe projection measurement system for radial vibration monitoring of rotating shafts Shaft radial vibration signals of rotary machines are crucial dynamic information for condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. A novel vision-based fringe projection vibration measurement system is proposed to monitor the radial displacements of a rotating shaft. The fringe pattern was projected on the surface of the shaft and the deformed fringe was acquired by a high-speed camera. A novel fringe processing algorithm was proposed to extract the radial displacement with good accuracy and efficiency. The vertical displacement could be obtained by locating the symmetric center of the recorded fringe. Meanwhile, the horizontal displacement could be obtained from the shift of the fringe at the symmetric center. The influence factors affecting measurement performance were analyzed. Simulations and comparative experiments were carried out for the verification of the feasibility and reliability of the proposed system. Comparing with the multiple eddy current sensors based system, the proposed method can realize multi-dimensional vibration measurement using one camera. The merits of simple in system, easy in operation, high accuracy and effectiveness in measurement make it attractive for dynamic characterization, condition monitoring and faults diagnosis of rotating machineries in actual applications. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85133719562
"Multivariate Empirical Wavelet Transform and Its Application to Rolling Bearings Empirical wavelet transform (EWT) is a recently proposed algorithm for single-channel signal separation, which has been widely applied in the field of fault diagnosis. With the development of sensors, multi-sensors are increasingly applied in equipment condition monitoring, and multi-channel signals can more comprehensively characterize the fault signals of bearings. Aiming at the problem that EWT cannot deal with multi-channel signals, the multivariate empirical wavelet transform (MEWT) method is proposed in this paper.

"Fault Diagnosis of Rolling Bearing in Broad Learning System Based on Multi-domain Feature Selection This paper presents a novel solution for bearing fault diagnosis based on a Broad Learning System with multi-domain feature selection. Currently, the diagnosis of bearing faults is beset with numerous challenges, including operation under complex and fluctuating conditions, the subtlety of early fault indicators, noise interference in measurement signals, variations in operational conditions, and a broad spectrum of potential fault types. These factors collectively contribute to the complexity of accurately identifying and classifying bearing faults. The Broad Learning System introduced in this paper, by integrating multi-domain feature selection, enhances the model's capability to extract and utilize relevant features from noisy or incomplete data, potentially increasing diagnostic accuracy in suboptimal sensor environments.

"The Msegram: A useful multichannel feature synchronous extraction tool for detecting rolling bearing faults Multichannel signals collected by multiple sensors contain richer condition information of equipment than single-channel signals. However, such issues as simultaneous denoising, adaptive decomposition and synchronous extraction are still challenging for multichannel signals, which are beneficial to accurate fault diagnosis. Thus, a useful multichannel feature synchronous extraction tool is proposed for detecting rolling bearing faults, named as Msegram. First, a tensor synchronization denoising method based on high order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) is proposed for multichannel signal preprocessing. Original multichannel signals of testing bearings are constructed to be a third-order tensor by phase space reconstruction. Hereinto, a singular entropy increment is adopted to determine a reasonable singular order for each unfolding, and an optimal core tensor is obtained for local reconstruction analysis. Second, multi-layer K-value multivariate variational mode decomposition (MVMD) is designed after the multichannel noise reduction to realize synchronous adaptive filtering and decomposition for the multichannel signals. Third, inspired by the idea of the spectral kurtosis, a tower-shaped crest factor of envelope spectrum (EC) diagram similar to Fast Kurtogram (FK) is proposed to visualize the output of multichannel bearing fault feature results. According to the tower-shaped EC diagram with the maximum fault crest factor, the optimal analytic results of multichannel signals are selected and output to synchronously extract bearing fault features. Finally, repeatable simulations and two experimental fault cases of rolling bearings are implemented to demonstrate the practicability and effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method can successfully reveal the compound faults from experimental bearing and effectively identify the compound faults from locomotive wheelset bearing. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85142863513
"Fault diagnosis of the hydraulic valve using a novel semi-supervised learning method based on multi-sensor information fusion Hydraulic systems are usually applied in large and complex engineering fields. For hydraulic systems or components in operation, it is difficult to obtain fault data with fault labels due to the high engineering cost. Therefore, a semi-supervised learning (SSL) method based on multi-sensor information fusion is proposed to obtain valuable pseudo label data to diagnose faults of the hydraulic directional valve in operation. In this method, the classification model is trained from a small amount of data with fault labels, thus generating pseudo labels for a large amounts of unmarked data. The contribution of this article is that a multi-sensor fusion algorithm is designed to obtain pseudo labels with high confidence, and an adaptive threshold model similar to generative countermeasure network is designed to intelligently generate thresholds for selecting pseudo labels instead of human intervention. Theoretical and experimental results show that the multi-sensor information fusion algorithm can obtain high confidence pseudo tags, the adaptive threshold model can screen effective pseudo tag samples by generating appropriate thresholds for accelerating the convergence of the classification model. In the hydraulic valve fault diagnostic test, after five iterations, the average diagnosis accuracy of this method can reach 99.72% and 99.00% respectively for different types of hydraulic valves in different engineering fields. This provides a new idea for developing intelligent hydraulic directional valve with self fault diagnosis function. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85145965162
"Wiener degradation models with scale-mixture normal distributed measurement errors for RUL prediction When the field collected data is biased by unexpected errors due to sensors and measurement, simple Wiener process may fail to correctly estimate the true degradation path. Most existing studies assume additive Gaussian errors in the true degradation path to account for the effects of measurement errors. This assumption is prone to unexpected outliers during the data collection. To achieve a robust estimation for the underlying degradation process, we propose to model the measurement errors using a family of thick-tailed distributions, called Scale-Mixture Normal (SMN) distributions. The SMN distribution can be expressed as a Gaussian hierarchy structure, which is more robust to unexpected outliers. We develop an efficient Expectation-Maximum (EM) algorithm incorporating the Variational Bayesian method to estimate the model parameters. We also derive the distribution of the remaining useful life for online monitoring. The efficiency of the model is verified by Monte Carlo simulations, and the performance of the proposed model on real data is illustrated by the application on hard disk drivers and thrust ball bearing degradation data. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85126620878
"Adapting geometry-based polygonal contacts for simulating faulty rolling bearing dynamics Rolling bearings are a leading cause of equipment breakdowns in electrical machines, underscoring the significance of predictive maintenance strategies. However, the given methods require high-quality big data, which is challenging to acquire, especially for faulty cases. Simulation models offer an alternative by generating large data sets to complement experimental data. However, bearings involve complex contact-related phenomena, such as slipping and clearance. Therefore, generating realistic data comparable to the real-world necessitates accuracy. Our study presents a multibody simulation system of a motor bearing, incorporating a geometry-based polygonal contact method (PCM), which accurately captures nonlinear bearing dynamics and allows for the simulation of various contact geometries. We introduce a systematic approach to adjust the PCM contact properties for rolling bearings, referencing the well-established Hertzian theory. Both healthy and faulty bearings with a local outer ring fault were simulated. The simulated output was a relative shaft displacement, experimentally validated using a capacitive sensor. Our model successfully demonstrates the potential to employ geometry-based contacts for generating realistic data on faulty bearings with the aim of predictive maintenance. © 2023 The Author(s)",2-s2.0-85178558441
"Aircraft robust data-driven multiple sensor fault diagnosis based on optimality criteria A general robust data-driven scheme for the Fault Detection, Isolation and Estimation of multiple sensor faults is proposed and validated using multi-flight data records. Robustness to modelling uncertainty and noise is achieved through an optimized data-driven design of the three blocks that constitute the scheme. First, a robust Fault Detection (FD) filter given by the linear combination of previously identified Analytical Redundancy Relationships (AARs) is derived as the solution of a multi-objective optimization where the minimum fault sensitivity is maximized while the standard deviation (STD) of the filtered error, in nominal condition, is minimized. Then, a Fault Pre-Isolation (FPI) block is introduced to select a restricted number of sensors containing with high likelihood the subset of the faulty sensors. In this phase, robustness is achieved through the data-driven design of a redundant number of Multiple-ARRs and a voting logic. Finally, the robust Fault Isolation (FI) is achieved relying on the design of a large collection of additional AARs whose fault signatures are specifically designed to optimize, at the same time, noise immunity while maximizing the decoupling of the (pre-isolated) fault directions. A procedure based on fault amplitude reconstruction is proposed to isolate the set of faulty sensors sequentially. The proposed scheme has been applied to the design of a multiple Fault Diagnosis scheme for a set of 8 sensors of a semi-autonomous aircraft basing on multi-flight data.

"A multi-function integrated PVDF transducer for fault detection and speed measurement of cylindrical roller bearings Monitoring the condition of bearings in rotating machinery is crucial to ensure reliability, safety, and efficiency. Recently, integrated sensors have become more popular than traditional accelerometers in bearing condition monitoring because of their compact design, cost-effectiveness, and improved efficiency in fault detection through a short transmission path. This study presents a new approach to bearing condition monitoring by developing a bearing with an integrated Polyvinylidene Fluoride transducer. This polymer-based transducer, known as PVDF, has a piezoelectric effect which generates electric charge in response to mechanical excitation. The PVDF transducer was selected for its high sensitivity, flexibility, and thin structure.

"An adaptive-noise Augmented Kalman Filter approach for input-state estimation in structural dynamics The establishment of a Digital Twin of an operating engineered system can increase the potency of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) tools, which are then bestowed with enhanced predictive capabilities. This is particularly relevant for wind energy infrastructures, where the definition of remaining useful life is a main driver for assessing the efficacy of these systems. In order to ensure a proper representation of the physical structure, the monitored response of the Digital Twin should match the one experienced by the actual system throughout the complete spectrum of its operational conditions. In most typical SHM configurations, it is only possible to rely on output-only measurements, acquired from finite positions within a structure, which naturally raises the challenge of recovering the full-field operational response, including unmeasured locations. This problem, also known as Virtual Sensing (VS), has been treated using different schemes, including Bayesian filtering and Modal Expansion (ME). In this paper, the Augmented Kalman Filter (AKF) is exploited to this end; a tool which allows for simultaneous full-field response and unmeasured input prediction. The common issue of Bayesian filtering relies on calibration of the filters defining parameters, namely the assumed measurement and process noise covariance levels. While the first is directly related to the accuracy of the employed physical sensors, the latter often acts as a tuning parameter for improving the reliability of the prediction. The process noise covariance adjustment is often performed in an offline fashion, either by making use of regularization methods, e.g., the L-curve method, or via trial and error. In this work, we propose a methodology for automated process noise covariance adaptation, relying on response estimates recovered by means of an improved ME approach. The method is validated on experimental data from a large scale research Wind Turbine (WT) blade made of glass fiber reinforced plastics. © 2022 The Authors",2-s2.0-85136500938
"Unknown fault feature extraction of rolling bearings under variable speed conditions based on statistical complexity measures As the main transmission components of rotating machinery, rolling bearings have important research significance for fault diagnosis and state detection. However, the operating environment of mechanical equipment is complex, and the fault characteristic information of rolling bearings is often unknown. Through the complex transmission path, the bearing seat vibration sensor picks up the fault vibration response is weaker, and it is often submerged by strong noise. When the speed and load of rotating mechanical equipment change, the fault characteristic of rolling bearings is more obvious under variable speed conditions. The fault diagnosis problem of rolling bearings needs to be solved urgently under strong noise background, variable speed, and unknown fault characteristics. Therefore, this paper studies an unknown fault feature extraction method of variable speed rolling bearing based on statistical complexity measures (SCM). Order analysis preprocesses the variable speed vibration signal of rolling bearings. It is convenient for subsequent fault feature extraction and analysis. The SCM selects the optimal intrinsic mode function (IMF) component corresponding to the Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) decomposition, and it is also evaluated index for the optimal response of stochastic resonance. Therefore, the adaptive frequency shift stochastic resonance effectively extracts the unknown fault features of rolling bearings under strong noise background. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85125872513
"A nonlinear dynamic ensemble remaining useful life prediction method considering multi-source data uncertainty Multi-performance indicator fusion methods have been widely applied for prognostics and health management, but the monitoring indicators are significantly influenced by the internal and external operational environment of the measuring instrument, which creates greater uncertainty to the prediction results. To address this issue, a nonlinear dynamic ensemble remaining useful life (RUL) prediction framework considering multi-source data uncertainty is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a multi-performance indicator fusion method considering data uncertainty is proposed. This method explicates the multi-indicator data as various proxies of the degradation state of equipment by establishing a multivariate implicit nonlinear state function and a multivariate measurement function, and constructs an optimal fusion strategy by designing a new objective function related to the performance of the indicator. Besides, a multi-model nonlinear dynamic ensemble method is proposed to compensate for the inadequacy of a single model to accurately characterize the degradation trajectory by integrating the prediction results of different degradation models in real-time. Finally, a Likal-Recursive algorithm is developed to address the challenge of estimating latent variables in multivariate state-space models without relying on initial parameter assumptions. The superior performance and effectiveness of the proposed framework are validated using the C-MAPSS dataset and multi-sensor datasets of rolling bearings. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-105000402684
"A two-stage leak monitoring framework for water distribution networks based on acoustic signals Timely monitoring of pipeline leaks is essential to avoid secondary contamination of drinking water and economic losses and to ensure the sustainability of water distribution networks (WDNs). However, it is prominent that the field acoustic signal sensors have high false alarm rates and unclear leak management priorities. To address the above issues, a two-stage leak monitoring framework based on acoustic signals is proposed in this work by drawing on meteorological domain knowledge, including two stages of leak detection and leak assessment. (1) In the leak detection stage, the acoustic signals are converted to Mel spectrograms, and the Residual Convolutional and Transformer networks (RCT-Net) are coupled to achieve local and global extraction of spectral features. Then, the pipeline state (leak and no-leak) is determined after calculating the leak probability of each pipeline by nonlinear feature fusion. (2) In the leak assessment stage, the pre-trained RCT-Net in the first stage is retrained and fine-tuned to achieve different leak level predictions (Light, Medium, and Severe), and improve the fault tolerance of field applications. Taking acoustic signals of real WDNs as an example, comparing the deep learning models of CNN architecture and Transformer, the framework has the best recognition performance and robustness, with more than 97% of all evaluation metrics on the leak detection and level assessment, including AUC up to 99.7%. The proposed monitoring framework can provide comprehensive leak monitoring information, which provides a new perspective on leak management prioritization, reducing water losses, and guiding water utilities toward sustainable development. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85214312223
"A Study of a Novel Acoustic Metamaterial Structure for Signal Enhancement Based on Fan Blade Fault Diagnosis Compared with traditional diagnostic technologies such as vibration sensors and visual cameras, acoustic sensors have the advantages of remote and global sensing, rapid deployment, good real-time performance, and low cost. However, acoustic signals are easily disturbed by ambient noise and decay rapidly, which makes it difficult to analyze faults in practical applications, especially when the fault signal as a low signal-to-noise ratio. By designing a metamaterial structure with a high refractive index medium and reasonable geometric parameters, the wavelength of sound wave can be compressed to improve the sound pressure. Employing fan blade faults as an object, Hilbert envelope spectrum analysis was used to demodulate fault characteristic information. Experimental results show that the acoustic metamaterial structure can enhance the signal significantly, providing high signal-to-noise ratio envelope spectrum for diagnosing fan blade faults. The study has demonstrated this acoustic metamaterial structure is an effective way to improve the applicability of acoustic measurement for condition monitoring. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85151162133
"Diagnosis of composite faults for complex industrial machinery: A label-assisted self-supervised clustering approach Early detection of faults is crucial to ensure the effective operation of industrial machinery. Incipient faults are hard to detect because the fault signals are weak, lack sufficient labels, and there is interference caused by multiple sensor signals and a large amount of noise background. Once a fault occurs, it will usually lead to composite faults that are coupled together, seriously affecting the accuracy of fault diagnosis. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a Label-assisted Self-supervised Clustering (LASSC) approach, which consists of two stages. The first stage is to mine the coupling characteristics of multi-sensor signals, and the second stage is to judge the composite fault states. Due to significant differences in magnitude, some fault features are ignored when learning from multi-sensor signals. To cope with this, constraint boundaries-based normalization is employed. Unlabeled data are projected onto a weight matrix through feature clustering, and the composite fault features are mined through unsupervised clustering. With the constraint of the assistance labels, self-supervised clustering integrates information from all channels to diagnose composite faults. Experiments are conducted using the proposed LASSC approach on the CWRU dataset to validate the accuracy and computational efficiency of the model. In addition, a series of experiments are designed on the excavator dataset, such as sample imbalance and limited labeled data, to verify the adaptability of the model in practical industrial applications.

This approach is important because it can aid in the estimation of wave speed or detection of water pipeline defects such as blockages and leakages. More importantly it overcomes the challenging problem of generating a signal source of sufficient power to provide the necessary signal-to-noise ratios for conventional water pipeline imaging and fault detection techniques. In this paper, the expressions of the auto- and cross-correlation functions of the ambient noise between sensors are derived using wave theory. It is shown that the time-domain Green's functions can be extracted from the correlation functions. Experimental and numerical examples are provided for water pipelines to demonstrate that wave speed can be estimated from the time-domain Green's functions. A method for extending the technique, by using straightforward but accurate approximations of the correlation functions, to detect the presence of defects in the profile of the water pipeline is also proposed. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85103933800

"Faults detection and classification in a centrifugal pump from vibration data using markov parameters One of the strategies to detect and classify faults in mechanical systems is to use a time domain family of techniques known as output-only methods. Those methods are based on the analysis of sample covariance matrices, which are estimated from vibration data extracted from mechanical systems under unmeasured natural excitation. Using the stochastic realization theory, it is possible to derive Markov parameters from sample covariance matrices. Those parameters contain only the significant spectral components from data. In this paper, a novel output-only method based on the Markov parameters is proposed to diagnose faults. The idea is to use the Markov parameters estimated from vibration data as features in classification algorithms based on convex optimization. The method was applied to diagnose incipient cavitation failures in a water supply network centrifugal pump. A low-cost triaxial vibration sensor developed by one of the authors was used to register the vibration data. The proposed method was compared to the analysis based on sample covariance matrices demonstrating the advantages related to the use of the Markov parameters. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85102146419
"Intelligent Fault Diagnosis Method of Inertial Sensors for Space Gravitational Wave Detection Space inertial sensor is one of the key loads in space gravitational wave detection mission. Once it fails, the entire mission is likely to be affected or even fail. The existing data-driven intelligent fault diagnosis methods can effectively diagnose some sensor faults, but it is still difficult to solve the problem that measurement data of space inertial sensor is strong coupling and includes much noise. To solve this issue, this paper proposes a convolutional recurrent variational encoder (CRVAE) for fault diagnosis of space inertial sensors. Specifically, a multilevel feature matrix that represents different time scales is firstly constructed based upon sensor raw data. Subsequently, CRVAE trained by health sensor data encodes the feature matrix, then reconstructs the matrix by decoding. Decoded matrix should restore the original feature matrix as much as possible. Intuitively, the decoded matrix of fault data will hardly restore the original state. By analyzing the residual feature matrix generated by CRVAE, the fault diagnosis of space inertial sensors can be realized. In addition, a fault evaluation function is given in order to estimate the fault severity. The result shows the method of this paper can detect fault timely and accurately, and the proposed fault evaluation function can achieve precisely quantitative analysis of fault severity. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85180622994
"Switching Kalman filter for damage estimation in the presence of sensor faults Bayesian filtering based approaches for diagnosis of structural damage have been widely employed in structural health monitoring (SHM) research. The approach however may lead to an inaccurate alarm/decision due to the presence of faulty sensor/s. Nevertheless, sensor faults are inevitable during real field SHM in which sensor may malfunction or get detached from the structural surface, registering completely irrelevant information as measurement. Eventually, such erroneous information induce error in the estimation which leads to an inaccurate, sometimes divergent and impractical solution. The current study deals with Bayesian filtering based structural damage detection in the presence of one or multiple (consecutive) sensor faults. The damage detection is addressed with joint state-parameter estimation approach while a switching filtering strategy is employed for sensor fault detection. Switching approach employs multiple possible sensor fault models which are subsequently integrated to the measurement model of the joint estimation approach. The selection of the competent model (/switching between model ensembles) is undertaken recursively based on their likelihood against measured response. The proposed approach is tested on a numerical lumped mass model of a shear frame building, followed by a laboratory experiment on a cantilever beam. It has been perceived that estimation of health for structures measured with faulty sensors can actually lead to a false (positive and negative) alarm which can, however, be avoided by the employment of the proposed approach. The performance of the proposed approach is further established for healthy and damaged system with pre-existing and sudden sensor faults. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85128674237
"Frequency energy shift method for bearing fault prognosis using microphone sensor A novel health index is proposed to detect incipient fault of ball bearing and monitor its progression earlier than the visible fault appearance using the microphone sensor. Frequency energy shift method is employed to extract the health index (HI), based on the findings that the energy is concentrated and shifted in specific frequency bands as the fault progresses. In the early stage, the anomaly of incipient fault is detected by the Chi-square test of HI. The end of life where visible faults appear is defined by the moment when the raw signal and its envelope spectrum at fault frequencies show distinct increase. Natural faults made by run-to-fail (RTF) experiments are used to demonstrate the approach. The performance of HI using the microphone sensor is superior to that of vibration due to the advantage of non-contact sensing. It successfully indicates early fault detection and damage progression before the visible faults show up. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85087277961
"Multi-sensor open-set cross-domain intelligent diagnostics for rotating machinery under variable operating conditions Domain adaptation techniques have the proven ability to deal with fault diagnosis issues under variable operating conditions. They can achieve a superb diagnostic performance in single-sensor monitoring scenarios where the training and test data share the same label space. However, in practical engineering, fault modes are usually mixed with each other and new failure modes may appear during operation, which poses a challenge to the effectiveness of existing cross-domain fault diagnosis methods. Furthermore, with the increasing complexity of modern industrial systems, multi-sensor collaborative monitoring has been increasingly deployed for comprehensive measurement and detection of the complicated system. Unfortunately, there is less attention paid to multi-sensor cross-domain diagnosis in the current literature. To bridge this research gap, this paper aims to develop a novel multi-sensor open-set cross-domain fault diagnosis method. First, a convolutional neural network-based single-sensor feature extraction module and a Transformer-based multi-sensor feature fusion module are constructed for discriminative feature extraction and fusion. Second, a weighted adversarial learning scheme is built to conduct domain-invariant learning of the shared fault modes between the source and target domains. Then, a threshold-based supervised contrastive loss is defined to realize instance-level domain alignment, together with an entropy max–min loss to identify unknown class samples. The effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method are validated by a series of experiments conducted on two different types of gearboxes. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85149713194
"Initial Fault Identification for Procedural Decision Making Using Biologically Inspired Condition Management System Biomimicry is an approach for solving industrial challenges by taking inspiration from bio-organisms’ responses. It is being used in various domains, such as engineering design, material science, sensor technology and robotics. In an ongoing research project, investigations are being carried out to explore the use of biomimicry approach, inspired by the working of human cognition, for developing a framework for a human-centric condition management system. In this system the decision-making process is divided into three components: (a) Primary Component, inspired by “Old Brain” to handle procedural decision-making, (b) Secondary Component, inspired by “New Brain” to handle deliberative decision-making, and (c) Arbitrator Component, to handle argumentative decision-making.

"A decision-level sensor fusion scheme integrating ultrasonic guided wave and vibration measurements for damage identification Structural health monitoring is designed to detect and analyze damage in mechanical, aerospace, and industrial structures to prevent potential catastrophic failures. The effectiveness of identifying structural faults and operational damage significantly relies on the sensing technology. Multisensory data fusion, as one of the promising techniques, combines data from multiple sensor modalities for reliable and accurate fault diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a novel decision-level multisensory data fusion approach. This approach combines data from an ultrasonic guided-wave sensor modality and a vibration sensor modality for the first time, aiming to achieve precise and stable damage identification. The Bayesian probabilistic distributions from each sensor modality are obtained using a multi-level Metropolis–Hastings algorithm. Subsequently, a multilayer perceptron network is trained to automatically allocate confidence scores for each sensor modality. The final fusion results are derived from the proposed decision-level fusion approach, combining the Bayesian probabilistic distributions from each sensor modality with allocated confidence scores. Simulation and experiment results indicate that the decision-level fusion approach produces more accurate and reliable outcomes for damage identification compared to relying on a single modality, especially in the case of progressive damage. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85195538792
"Multiclass Fault Diagnosis and Novelty Detection of Induction Motor Using Deep Learning Algorithm Based on Frequency Domain Signal This paper presents the development of a deep learning model for effective fault diagnosis of the Induction Motor (IM). For prompt detection of these faults, vibration and current frequency domain signals are investigated. The proposed methodology predicts the sensor fault condition and based on that IM faults were predicted so that corrupt sensor data cannot manipulate the output. The vibration and current signals were acquired after multiple experiments of varying operating speed and loading conditions. The ten distinct health conditions that encountered in IM (one no defect condition, four mechanical fault and five electrical fault conditions) have been considered. Fault predictions have been performed by extracting different frequency domain features of the vibration and current signal.

"Artificial intelligence enhanced fault prediction with industrial incomplete information With the rapid advancement of sensor and information technology, fault prediction for industrial equipment has become increasingly feasible. However, accurate fault prediction is heavily dependent on the integrity of monitoring data. Unfortunately, limitations in data collection and storage technologies often result in incomplete and missing data, leading to decreased accuracy or even failure of predictive models. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel data-enhanced fault prediction method leveraging artificial intelligence, which stands out for its ability to handle incomplete information effectively. The innovation lies in the first-time division of incomplete information into incomplete variables and missing variables, each addressed with tailored AI-based solutions. Furthermore, the method integrates complete data with uncertain information through a dynamic Bayesian network, pioneering a new approach to compensating for data integrity issues and minimizing prediction errors. The enhanced data is then utilized for long-term performance predictions, setting a new standard in fault prediction accuracy. The developed model exhibits exceptional adaptability by integrating advanced techniques such as parameter uncertainty analysis, sensitivity analysis, and dynamic range analysis. These enhancements significantly boost the precision and comprehensiveness of fault predictions. The method's feasibility and superiority are demonstrated through the prediction of CO2 corrosion in subsea pipelines, proving that the proposed approach significantly improves fault prediction accuracy even under incomplete information conditions. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85206795907
"A novel drum-shaped metastructure aided weak signal enhancement method for bearing fault diagnosis Rolling bearings, extensively utilized in rotating machinery, have critical significance for online fault diagnosis in the domains of industrial equipment maintenance and accident prevention. Presently, fault diagnosis methods heavily rely on identifying the optimal resonance band in the high-frequency range (several kHz) to achieve high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) fault information. However, these approaches, which necessitate high sampling rate sensing systems and complex algorithm deployments, contradict the practical requirements for cost-effective sensors and edge computing in online diagnosis. To address this contradiction, this paper introduces a novel Drum-shaped Metastructure (DMS) to enhance weak bearing fault signals, thus promoting the detection performance of conventional sensors. The DMS is constructed with a drumhead metastructure consisting of a central block mass attached with four spiral beams, of which its length can be adjusted by a tunable frequency mechanism (TFM) for different frequency responses of interest. The detail of its selective frequency enhancement characteristics is first studied through numerical simulations within a frequency range of 200 Hz to 1000 Hz. Subsequently, the effectiveness of the weak signal enhancement is verified on various bearing test systems, which utilize a prototype DMS fabricated by 3D printing. The results present a significant enhancement in the SNRs of the bearing fault signal, which is achieved by demodulating the full frequency band without the need for complex algorithms. Therefore, the proposed DMS provides a new cost-efficient approach to weak bearing fault diagnosis and online monitoring. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85182916374
"Research on Online Monitoring Technology of 3D Printing Faults in Fused Deposition Molding During the procedure of 3D printing in Fused Deposition Molding (FDM), building faults, such as Congealed-Material (CM), empty printing, substrate deformation, warped edges and fused wire drawing, often occur. However, most FDM machines lack online monitor systems which lead to huge waste of materials and time. This paper combines an acceleration sensor with vision sensors to monitor CM faults during 3D printing in FDM. An acceleration sensor is used to collect signals during a printing procedure and then abnormal signals are found when nozzle collides with CM. Subsequently, CM can be detected through the STFT algorithm. Furthermore, acceleration data can provide fault characteristics for on-line monitoring. Finally, a camera is used to obtain 3D print model pictures and then an image processing algorithm is studied. An image window is used to reduce calculation amount and extract useful model features. Then, a connected region area is calculated and the largest area region is selected after a threshold and a region are connected. Through image processing, online CM detection can be realized, which provides a foundation for further positioning and removal of CM. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85105994715
"A review on the use of angle measurements in gear condition monitoring and fault detection Condition monitoring is crucial for the predictive maintenance of gear transmissions to avoid unexpected failures with downtimes, costly repairs, or dangerous incidents. While vibration-based condition monitoring is widespread in industry and research, using angle measurements as a primary source still offers much potential. This review provides insights into current methods of angle-based condition monitoring for gear transmissions – from sensors, data acquisition, and algorithms to condition evaluations. It shows how current research applies measurement principles with various resolutions and sampling frequencies at stationary and dynamic operating conditions. It includes one or multiple angle measurements (instantaneous angle, instantaneous angular speed, instantaneous angular acceleration, or transmission error), electric current measurements, or the combination with acceleration measurements. Next to rotation as an auxiliary quantity for vibration order tracking, the review, in particular, focuses on algorithms with angle-based condition indicators. It summarizes the state of research of preprocessing, feature engineering, and automatic condition evaluation methods. Using angle measurements for gear condition monitoring is a promising approach to improve fault detection capabilities.

"Fault Detection in Induction Machines of Air Handling Units Air Handling Units (AHU) are considered one of the main parts of the HVAC (Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning) system. They are commonly used in residential, commercial, health care, and industrial buildings. Systems related to health care units must be applied for an intensive type of maintenance to avoid sudden shutdowns and exposing the patient to serious health issues. For that, we present in this paper a predictive maintenance system to monitor and predict faults that might occur in the induction machines of the AHU. The two main features that we focused on were the misalignment and the looseness faults. Experiments were conducted using a vibration sensor and a temperature sensor. Vibration amplitude and frequency were recorded and analyzed. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied. Experimental results show that we can detect misalignment and the looseness faults that occurs to machines. Ensuring reliable hospitals supports good health and well-being SDG.

"Experimental and numerical looseness detection and assessment in flanged joints using vibro-acoustic modulation method Flanged joints’ looseness is among the common causes for the failure of industrial structures with flanged joints the timely detection of which can prevent the imposition of heavy financial losses and in some cases injuries. There are conventional methods for detecting this fault and each of them has its own drawbacks. For instance, torque control methods have high error of measurement, impedance-based measurement methods, have high expenses, and vibration or ultrasonic methods lack accuracy due to the use of linear phenomena in fault detection. Vibro-Acoustic modulation method is one of the nonlinear fault detection methods that can detect and assess looseness of flanged joints with high precision through the measurement of the intensity of the vibrational and ultrasonic signals modulation applied to the structure. This paper was an attempt to investigate the efficiency of the Vibro-Acoustic modulation method in the detection and evaluation of flanged joints numerically and experimentally. For this, a laboratory sample composed of two pipes connected with flanged joints is employed. It is revealed that this method can detect bolt looseness with 12.5% precision. In addition, the effect of parameters such as ultrasonic and vibrational frequency, amplitude of applied torque, sensors and actuators position, as well as excessive increase of torque have been examined and the method precision in the studied structure has been estimated. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2-s2.0-85088318297
"Discriminative feature learning using a multiscale convolutional capsule network from attitude data for fault diagnosis of industrial robots Effective fault diagnosis is important to ensure the reliability, safety, and efficiency of industrial robots. This article proposes a simple yet effective data acquisition strategy based on transmission mechanism analysis, using only one attitude sensor mounted on an end effector or an output component to monitor the attitude of all transmission components. Unlike widely used vibration-monitoring signals, attitude signals can provide fault features reflecting spatial relationships. Using one attitude sensor facilitates the data collection, but weakens fault features and introduces strong background noise in attitude signals. To learn discriminative features from the attitude data collected by the attitude sensor, a multiscale convolutional capsule network (MCCN) is proposed. In MCCN, integrating low-level and high-level features in a convolutional neural network (CNN) as multiscale features is conductive to noise reduction and robust feature extraction, and a capsule network (CapsNet) is used to recognize the spatial relationships in attitude data. The extracted multiscale features in CNN and the spatial-relational features in CapsNet are fused for effective fault diagnosis of industrial robots. The performance of MCCN is evaluated by attaching a softmax-based classifier and integrating it into different transfer learning frameworks to diagnose faults in industrial robots under single and variable working conditions, respectively. Fault diagnosis experiments were conducted on a 6-axis series industrial robot and a parallel robot-driven 3D printer. The superiority of the proposed MCCN was demonstrated by comparing its performance with the other feature learning methods. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85134601959
"Shrinkage mamba relation network with out-of-distribution data augmentation for rotating machinery fault detection and localization under zero-faulty data Data-driven fault detection (FD) or diagnosis methods are key technologies to ensure safe operation of rotating machinery. These methods rely on a requisite volume of fault data. However, acquiring fault data from rotating machinery is typically problematic and can be entirely unattainable. The critical challenge is to accurately detect and localize the fault states of rotating machinery under the absence of any fault data. Therefore, a newly shrinkage Mamba relation network (SMRN) with out-of-distribution data (OODD) augmentation is proposed for FD and localization in rotating machinery with zero-faulty data. Firstly, the corresponding sensors are arranged for the key detection locations on the rotating machinery. The data generator is referenced to generate OODD for the health data at each detection locations, assisting in mining of intrinsic state information from health data. Then, feature pairs are built in health data and OODD to reveal inter-state attribute relationships. Finally, the location of faults in rotating machinery is determined by evaluating the similarity between feature pairs at each detection location. The SMRN method effectiveness is verified by using self-built propulsion shaft system experiments and rolling bearing cases. The experimental results show the SMRN method can effectively detect and localize fault state of rotating machinery in multiple fault modes, compound fault scenarios, and variable operating conditions. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85209069740
"Extrapolating from one: A pseudo multi-view fusion approach for enhanced out-of-distribution detection in fault diagnosis With outstanding performance, deep learning-based fault diagnosis methods have achieved many excellent results. However, these performances are fragile due to their high dependence on the assumption that data are independent and identically distributed (IID). Once the model diagnoses out-of-distribution(OOD) as an IID, it leads to unreliable diagnostic results. Although it is a reliable way to achieve OOD detection by information increment through multiple sensors, it cannot be applied in practice due to the requirement of single sensor in industrial scenarios. Thereby, combined with Dempster–Shafer theory and evidential deep learning, we propose a Pseudo-Multiview Fusion (PMvF) approach for OOD detection in fault diagnosis. PMvF aims to improve the reliability of diagnostic results by leveraging the advantages of information fusion without adding additional inputs. PMvF calculates the uncertainty in the both time and frequency domains of the single sensor and constructs fusion rules to obtain uncertainty from multiple perspectives to analyze the input. A series of experimental results validated the effectiveness of PMvF, which significantly reduced the OOD false detection rate (FPR95 decreased by 49.1%). PmvF provides a feasible novel paradigm for improving the reliability and overall performance of the model. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-105001875681

"Multi-scale time series analysis using TT-ConvLSTM technique for bearing remaining useful life prediction This study advocates the utilization of a parallel neural network (PNN) architecture for the estimation of remaining useful life (RUL) of rolling element bearings. Conventional machine learning methods have often fallen short in processing machinery sensor data efficiently and accurately, given its vast nature and the temporal dynamics of component health conditions. To address this limitation, a robust PNN architecture is proposed which incorporates multiple parallel processing pathways. These pathways are equipped with diverse input neurons, capturing data from mechanical component condition sensors. The output neuron then efficiently predicts the RUL, capturing the degradation stages throughout the component's lifespan. The PNN structure provides better accuracy and computation time by efficiently handling huge amounts of data simultaneously and integrating both spatial and temporal information present. Additionally, time-transformer and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are used to handle complex time series data. Improvement methodologies, such as positional encoding combined with a multi-headed self-attention mechanism and the convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) neural network, are employed. These methodologies adeptly handle spatiotemporal dependencies inherent in multidimensional features extracted across the time domain, frequency domain, and time–frequency domain, thereby considerably boosting the model's efficacy. Two case studies are conducted on XJTU-SY rolling element bearing dataset and FEMTO bearing dataset to validate and display the generalization capabilities of the proposed methodology, where PNN performed exceptionally in terms of accuracy and efficiency. It is concluded that with a novel implementation of variational stride temporal window strategy and utilizing the full capabilities of a PNN, the RUL of bearings can be predicted very accurately.

"Machinery multi-sensor fault diagnosis based on adaptive multivariate feature mode decomposition and multi-attention fusion residual convolutional neural network Due to the complex and rugged working environment of real machinery equipment, the resulting fault information is easily submerged by severe noise interference. Additionally, some informative features may be omitted if the feature learning concerns only a single sensor of machinery vibration data. Therefore, to mine more comprehensive fault information and achieve more robust fault diagnosis results, this study proposes a machinery multi-sensor fault diagnosis method based on adaptive multivariate feature mode decomposition and multi-attention fusion residual convolutional neural network. As an extension of the feature mode decomposition (FMD), the adaptive multivariate feature mode decomposition (AMFMD) with the improved whale optimization algorithm (IWOA) is firstly presented to automatically decompose the collected multi-sensor vibration data into a group of multichannel mode components, which both inherit the anti-noise robustness of the original FMD and overcome the obstacles of artificial parameter selection of FMD. Subsequently, multichannel mode components containing the most abundant fault information are selected via an impulse sensitive measure hailed as multichannel comprehensive index (MCI), and the frequency slice wavelet transform (FSWT) of the selected multichannel mode components is further calculated and organically fused to generate the colored multichannel time–frequency representation (MTFR) containing multi-sensor important signatures. Finally, by integrating the advantages of feature learning of residual network (ResNet) and convolutional neural network (CNN), a multi-attention fusion residual convolutional neural network (MAFResCNN) with squeeze-excitation module (SEM) and convolutional block attention module (CBAM) is constructed to simultaneously capture global and local feature information from the fused multichannel time–frequency representation and implement automatic discrimination of machinery fault states, which can both enhance machinery fault information and whittle down the useless information, even promote the feature learning performance without significantly increasing the computational burden of the model. The validity of the proposed approach is verified by a diagnosis case of a real wind turbine, demonstrating that the proposed approach has superiority in machinery fault identification compared with some similar techniques. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85168420501

"Information-Physical Attack Identification Method of Complex Oil and Gas Production System Based on SVM The process of attack identification of data-driven complex oil and gas production systems is often mixed with fault data, which leads to the failure of timely attack defense or fault relief, resulting in the occurrence of attacks and oil and gas production accidents. Most of the current attack detection focuses on the detection of external attacks, ignoring the impact of the possible fault data of the oil and gas system itself on the attack detection. To distinguish abnormal events such as system faults from information attacks in complex oil and gas production systems and improve the accuracy of information physical attack detection in complex oil and gas production systems, an SVM-based undirected graph joint detection method is proposed. Firstly, the key sensors in the complex system of oil and gas production are topologized to form an undirected graph. Secondly, SVM is used to detect the anomalies of the undirected graph sensor system. Finally, the receiving station low-pressure pump system is taken as an example to verify.

"Adaptation of Model Transformation for Safety Analysis of IoT-Based Applications The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has continued to provide valuable services across various domains. However, guaranteeing the safety assurance of the IoT system is increasingly becoming a concern. While the growing complexity of IoT design has brought additional safety requirements, developing safe systems remains a critical design objective. In earlier studies, a limited number of approaches have been proposed to evaluate the safety requirements of IoT systems through the generation of static safety artefacts based on manual processes.

However, how to fuse multi-sensor information to facilitate RUL prediction accuracy remains a challenging problem due to the complex temporal and spatial dependencies within multi-sensor signals. To address this problem, we propose a dual-view graph Transformer, named as DVGTformer, for RUL prediction, which can fully learn potential degradation patterns from multi-sensor signals by capturing complex correlations within them. The proposed method involves the design of a novel graph Transformer, named as GTformer, by collaboratively integrating learnable graph adjacency matrix and multi-head self-attention to learn structural and dynamic correlations between the nodes of graphs. We then construct the DVGTformer for RUL prediction based on the GTformer. Each layer of a DVGTformer is formed by cascading a temporal-view GTformer layer and a spatial-view GTformer layer to fuse temporal and spatial information across time stamps and sensor nodes. Experimental results on the benchmark CMAPSS dataset and a wind turbine dataset from real applications show that our method consistently provides accurate and robust RUL prediction results compared with the state-of-the-art methods. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85177487303
"Model-Based Fault Detection and Isolation of Speed Sensors in Dual Clutch Transmission Speed sensors in a dual clutch transmission play an important role in the launch and gear-shift processes. Speed sensor faults seriously affect vehicle performance, resulting in riding discomfort, apart from being a threat to the safety of the system. To diagnose speed sensor faults in a dual clutch transmission vehicle, this paper proposes a fault detection and isolation method for the speed sensors based on the dynamic of the dual clutch transmission powertrain. First, a control-oriented dynamic model of a dual clutch transmission was established. Considering the model uncertainties and external disturbance, an unknown input observer was constructed to realize robust sensor fault detection. Second, a bank of observers was designed for sensor fault isolation. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed method can realize robust fault detection and isolation for dual clutch transmission speed sensors, which may further facilitate active fault-tolerant control of a dual clutch transmission powertrain. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85121999749

"Investigations on quasi-arithmetic means for machine condition monitoring Machine condition monitoring aims to use on-line sensor data to evaluate machine health conditions. One of the most crucial steps is construction of a health index for incipient fault detection and monotonic degradation assessment. Moreover, observations of a health index can be used as inputs to prognostic models for machine remaining useful life prediction. Even though significant outcomes about sparsity measures, such as kurtosis, the ratio of Lp to Lq norm, pq-mean, smoothness index, negative entropy, and Gini index, for machine health monitoring have been achieved during recent years, construction of a health index for simultaneously realizing incipient fault detection and monotonic degradation assessment is not fully explored due to unexpected variances of repetitive transients caused by rotating machine faults. To solve this problem, in this paper, quasi-arithmetic means (QAMs) are thoroughly investigated. Moreover, the aforementioned sparsity measures can be respectively reformulated as the ratios of different QAMs. Further, a generalized framework based on the ratio of different QAMs for machine health monitoring is proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that some special cases of the generalized framework can simultaneously detect incipient rotating faults, exhibit a monotonic degradation tendency and be robust to impulsive noises, and they are better than existing sparsity measures for machine health monitoring. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85096674925
"A Mobile Robot Based Monitoring Platform for Pipeline Leakage Diagnosis Based on Cross-correlation Analysis Nowadays, various pipelines are broadly used in the transportation of resources in the production process and life applications, such as natural gas, compressed air, water, oil and so on. Pipe leakages usually occur due to the improper manufacturing process, installation of valves or other devices, prolonged use, etc. Pipeline leakage will cause energy loss, pollution and other severe problems, which will lead to equipment damage and even casualties. Therefore, the detection of pipeline leakage is significantly important. Traditional pipeline leak detection requires visual inspection or many fixed detection sensors. This may cause missed inspection by human errors and also will greatly increase the cost on the expensive devices. Compared with visual inspection and specific testing devices, mobile robots have the advantages of portability, economic cost and wide application for effective and efficient pipeline leakage detection. Robots can be deployed on lines or near equipment prone to pipeline leaks which can be detected online according to the path set. This paper presents an effective pipeline leak detection method to monitor the leakage of a two-stage reciprocating compressor with a mobile robot. An android mobile phone is installed on the mobile robot platform. After the robot moves to the monitoring point, the microphone of the mobile phone starts to collect environmental sound. The cross-correlation analysis is then performed on the LABVIEW software platform to implement online detection of different leakage faults. The experimental results show that the extreme value of the correlation number is effective and efficient for real-time detection of the presence of leaks. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85106033133
"Rotor Crack Depth Estimation Using Recurrence Quantification Analysis Condition monitoring of machinery is gaining increasing importance as more and more complicated and interconnected systems are being developed. In such systems, it becomes critically important to forewarn about the impending faults that have developed in the components to ensure robust and safe operation. Faults that develop in rotating machinery are notoriously difficult to detect using conventional methods. These faults can exacerbate very quickly, which can cause irreparable damage, financial loss and potential casualties. Thus, development of robust techniques for damage detection is imperative for improving safety and reliability of machinery. These techniques use signals from widely deployed sensors, and once validated, can be used for continuous monitoring of the machinery systems, thereby aiding further automation. In this paper, we have developed a technique wherein Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) is used in conjunction with Machine Learning to predict the degradation of a crack in a rotating shaft. Recurrence is a phenomenon that is widely exhibited in many nonlinear processes, and recurrence plot is a two-dimensional visualization of the higher dimensional dynamical systems and helps to understand the recurrence of states in phase space. RQA is an objective and quantitative method to analyze recurrence plots and yields features of the dynamical systems which we employ in conjunction with appropriate Machine Learning algorithms in order to develop a robust diagnostics algorithm. To obtain the dynamic response of the system for various fault conditions, a physics-based model of the cracked rotors is used, and in order to map the RQA features to fault space, a multi-layer perceptron neural network is used. The results of this study demonstrate that RQA has outstanding performance in crack depth estimation with minimal need for expert knowledge about the dynamic response of the system. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",2-s2.0-85190260126
"Robust optimized weights spectrum: Enhanced interpretable fault feature extraction method by solving frequency fluctuation problem Machine condition monitoring (MCM) plays a pivotal role in ensuring the reliability, safety, and efficiency of a production and operation system. Fault feature extraction (FFE), as an important step within MCM, aims to filter out interference components (ICs) and extract fault components (FCs) from raw signals. Consequently, it facilitates incipient fault detection and performance degradation assessment. A recently proposed optimized weights spectrum (OWS) provided a data-driven FFE methodology with a strong theoretical foundation, but it was found that the OWS is highly sensitive to a frequency fluctuation problem caused by rotational speed fluctuations and sensor errors, which may result in fake fault signatures. Therefore, a robust optimized weights spectrum (ROWS) is proposed in this paper to solve the frequency fluctuation problem. The ROWS is inspired by an intuitive idea that employs functions with adaptive frequency bandwidths instead of isolated spectral lines to represent frequency components, thus mitigating the impact of the frequency fluctuation problem. To adaptively determine the optimal parameters for these functions and estimate the corresponding ROWS, an alternative optimization strategy is adopted. Then, the proposed ROWS can be obtained when convergence conditions of this strategy are satisfied. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed ROWS are verified by three real-world cases, i.e., the proposed ROWS can solve the frequency fluctuation problem and provide robust results for interpretable FFE. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85200204717
"A novel Lanczos quaternion singular spectrum analysis method and its application to bevel gear fault diagnosis with multi-channel signals Multi-channel signals collected by multiple sensors contain more operating information than single-channel signal, so multi-channel signal processing method can improve confidence level and accuracy of fault diagnosis. Multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) is the most widely used multi-channel signal method, however, it has the problem of mode mixing. Quaternion singular spectrum analysis (QSSA) is an effective multi-channel signal denoising method with three defects. It needs huge calculation time, the contribution of irrelevant components exists in selected singular values, and the obtained denoising signal derives from certain single-channel signal. Hence, a novel multi-channel signal processing method called Lanczos quaternion singular spectrum analysis (LQSSA) is proposed in this paper. First, LQSSA uses Lanczos method during the decomposition of the proposed method, which reduces the calculation time greatly. Then, filter value factor is obtained by introducing Lagrange multiplier to suppress the contribution of the irrelevant components and improve the purity of required signal. Finally, periodic similarity is used to obtain Lanczos quaternion singular spectrum components (LQSSCs) by taking the signal components as a whole, so it breaks the restriction between different channels. The proposed method is applied to simulated signals and experimental signals of bevel gear, and the analysis results show that the proposed method can extract the fault characteristic frequency from the multi-channel signals effectively. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85120969341
"The Dual-Encoder Transformer for Prediction of Aero-Engine Remaining Useful Life with Uncertainty Quantification Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction plays a crucial role for the Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) of aero-engines. However, existing deep learning methods for RUL prediction usually focus on overall prediction accuracy while neglecting the case-wise prediction reliability. This paper proposes a Dual-encoder Transformer (DT) model with the capability to quantify prediction uncertainty. The proposed method utilizes temporal and sensor encoders to handle temporal dependencies and sensor feature dependencies in multi-dimensional time series data, respectively. It adaptively learns more important feature information through the Gated Fusion Unit (GFU) and extends the model with variational inference to achieve effective uncertainty estimation. The proposed model is validated on the widely used NASA C-MAPSS dataset. Compared to the alternative models, the DT model demonstrates either superior or similar overall prediction accuracy.

"Fault-tolerant dynamic force/moment measuring platform for large spacecraft equipment using the GAALBP fusion algorithm The load-sharing platform described in this study can be employed to measure the dynamic forces from large sources in spacecraft. To address application issues, such as sensor failure, a fault-tolerant dynamic measurement strategy is provided together with a sensor fault detection approach. The least-squares-based fault-tolerant and non-fault-tolerant calibration models are then constructed. The models are used to measure the six-dimensional forces, and measuring results show that the accuracy and coupling error rate of LS-based fault-tolerant measurement are 26.00% and 16.49%, falling short of the requirements of 15% and 10%, respectively. A novel dynamic calibration approach is thus proposed, which is based on the Genetic Algorithm combined with Adaptive-Learning-rate-based Back Propagation algorithm (GAALBP). The measuring results with the trained models show that its fault-tolerant measurement accuracy and coupling rate are 5.50% and 2.10%. These performances are significantly better than those of the LS-based fault-tolerant measurement and can adequately meet the needs. Finally, the superiority of the improved algorithm is demonstrated by comparing it to competing methods. The aforementioned experiments illustrate that the proposed GAALBP-based fault-tolerant dynamic measurement technique is feasible and can be served as a guide for measuring dynamic forces in spaceflight and resolving sensor failure. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85184502356
"Metric-based meta-learning model for few-shot fault diagnosis under multiple limited data conditions The real-world large industry has gradually become a data-rich environment with the development of information and sensor technology, making the technology of data-driven fault diagnosis acquire a thriving development and application. The success of these advanced methods depends on the assumption that enough labeled samples for each fault type are available. However, in some practical situations, it is extremely difficult to collect enough data, e.g., when the sudden catastrophic failure happens, only a few samples can be acquired before the system shuts down. This phenomenon leads to the few-shot fault diagnosis aiming at distinguishing the failure attribution accurately under very limited data conditions. In this paper, we propose a new approach, called Feature Space Metric-based Meta-learning Model (FSM3), to overcome the challenge of the few-shot fault diagnosis under multiple limited data conditions. Our method is a mixture of general supervised learning and episodic metric meta-learning, which will exploit both the attribute information from individual samples and the similarity information from sample groups. The experiment results demonstrate that our method outperforms a series of baseline methods on the 1-shot and 5-shot learning tasks of bearing and gearbox fault diagnosis across various limited data conditions. The time complexity and implementation difficulty have been analyzed to show that our method has relatively high feasibility.

"A novel second-order output spectrum based local tuning method for locating bolt-loosening faults This paper presents a novel second-order output spectrum (SOOS) based method with a local tuning approach (LTA) for the precise localization of multiple bolt-loosening faults in complex structures with a simple sensor chain. The development of this new method is based on a recently developed virtual beam-like structure (VBLS) concept and the nth-order output spectrum estimation (nth-OSE) algorithm using only properly measured data. In this new method, a more general multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) model with general nonlinear restoring forces, caused by not only faults but also inherently existing material or boundary nonlinearities in structures, is considered, and a special local tuning mechanism is intentionally proposed to derive the novel SOOS based damage indicator. Results of numerical and experimental studies demonstrate that this novel SOOS based local tuning method can give more accurate, sensitive and reliable information about fault positions, and then can be used effectively and reliably for the precise localization of multiple bolt-loosening faults in complex structures even with inherent material or boundary nonlinearities. The results of this study would present a totally new insight into initial structural fault detection by employing sensitive nonlinear features from a systematic frequency domain approach. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85087590790
"Multi-label deep transfer learning method for coupling fault diagnosis With the development of complexity and integration of machines, the multiple components of the system are prone to simultaneous failures and the multi-fault signals may be measured in limited sensors. This fault mode is defined as coupling fault in this paper and becomes more common and attracts great attention. Current coupling fault diagnosis approaches rely on labeled data under consistent working conditions. However, in practical varying working conditions, the data is difficult to label and the traditional methods perform poorly. To address the challenge problem, we utilize some related annotated data under other working conditions for auxiliary learning and abstract this problem as a multi-label transfer learning problem which is a new research topic in fault diagnosis. We proposed a novel deep transfer coupling fault diagnosis method from the global and local views to achieve the effect of transfer, which is the first attempt to address this practical problem as far as we know. At the global level, we used Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) at multiple stages of the network to reduce the hypothesis space of the model. Furthermore, we design a special manifold framework with multi-level similarity to constrain the hierarchy of the distance of the sample and the hierarchy of the labels being consistent between the two domains, to further improve the effect of local alignment.

"Towards high-speed elevator fault diagnosis: A ParallelGraphNet driven multi-sensor optimization selection method Due to the complexity of the high-speed elevator operation system, a single sensor may not fully capture its fault characteristics comprehensively. Moreover, manual sensor placement limits fault feature reflection and fails to exploit sensor spatial advantages, hindering further development. To address these limitations, an optimization method for selecting the positions of multiple sensors is proposed by identifying those offering global information gain to make decisions. Additionally, the ParallelGraphNet (Graph Convolutional Network with parallel graph construction layers and parallel pooling layers) is introduced, which parallelly constructs node graphs and segmented graphs, deeply integrating the spatial and temporal characteristics of the collected signals. Moreover, two parallel pooling layers are introduced after the graph convolutional layer to better extract multi-scale features while preserving the original features. Experiments were conducted on the constructed high-speed elevator platform and publicly available gearbox datasets to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Comparative experiments were carried out from multiple perspectives, confirming that the proposed method can effectively select sensors to improve sensor acquisition efficiency and fault diagnosis accuracy.

"Degradation Detection and RUL Prediction of Rolling Bearings Based on Gini Index and Particle Filter Condition-based monitoring (CBM) plays a fundamental role in bearing prognostics health management. To effectively reveal the degradation severity of the bearings, the choice of health indicators based on sensor measurements determines the promptness of fault detection and predictive maintenance.

This study applies the Gini index of the vibration envelope signal (GIES) for bearing degradation detection and life prediction. Based on the changes of vibration impulsiveness, bearing degradation can be detected using the empirical three sigma rule. After the detection of bearing degradation, the remaining useful life (RUL) is predicted using the particle filter (PF) based on only a few GIES observations.

"Optimal sensor placement methodology of hydraulic control system for fault diagnosis During the state monitoring and fault diagnosis of hydraulic control system, different kinds of sensors are used to collect fault signals. The arrangement of a limited number of sensors in the most reasonable positions of the hydraulic system, that is, to solve the problem on the optimal placement of sensors, is the key to improving efficiency of fault diagnosis. Aiming at fault diagnosis of hydraulic control system, this paper proposes a sensor placement methodology of hydraulic control system to determine the optimal number and position of sensors based on a discrete particle swarm algorithm.

Finally, a discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to calculate the optimal solution for the optimal placement of sensors. In the iterative process, a Monte Carlo simulation-based comparison algorithm is used for the evaluation and comparison of particle. The simulation case of typical multi-circuit hydraulic control systems proves that the proposed method has fast convergence speed and optimization results.

"Study of the fault diagnosis method for gas turbine sensors based on inter-parameter coupling information Correct and reliable measurement data are crucial for state monitoring, safe operations, health assessment, and life prediction of integrated energy systems (IESs). Sensors are often installed in harsh environments and prone to all kinds of faults; therefore, it is necessary to diagnose sensor faults. A diagnostic method for sensor faults based on gradient histogram distribution (GHD) combined with light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) is presented in this paper. This proposed method effectively utilizes the coupling information between the relevant parameters. The GHD efficiently extracted the time-domain characteristics of sensor faults and reduced the dimension of eigenvectors. This is beneficial to increasing the diagnostic speed. The kernel density estimation distributions of the gradient and eigenvectors for the sensor with strong correlation are similar, but that for the sensor with weak correlation are completely different. A LightGBM classifier trained based on the feature vectors was utilized to diagnose and classify the sensor faults. The diagnosis accuracy and the diagnosis time of this developed method were examined using the multiple-condition practical operation data of gas turbines in the IES. The experiment results demonstrate that the diagnostic accuracy of five sensor faults using this developed method is all above 90%.

"Fault diagnosis of axial piston pump based on multi-source subdomain adaptation and sensor data fusion The axial piston pump is the core component in hydraulic systems. Its condition monitoring and fault diagnosis are crucial to ensure the safe and reliable operation of hydraulic systems. However, most of the existing fault diagnosis methods for axial piston pumps use the same working condition data. In actual operation, axial piston pump often experience varying loads, and the collected data is typically correlated but has different distributions. Therefore, a transfer learning method of multi-source subdomain adaptation and sensor fusion (MSASF) is proposed for fault diagnosis of axial piston pump. The proposed MSASF has three modules, a shared feature extraction module, a domain-specific feature extraction module and an output decision module. Firstly, the adaptive weighted fusion of multi-sensor data features is realized by the shared feature extraction module and the common features of multi-source heterogeneous data are extracted. Secondly, in the domain-specific feature extraction module, multi-branch network is used to extract features of each pair of source and target domains and the local maximum mean difference is utilized to align the sub-domain distribution of each pair of source and target domains. Finally, in the output decision module, the distribution distance between each pair of source domain and target domain is calculated using maximum mean discrepancy to obtain its weighted score. Combined with the classification output of each source domain, the final diagnosis decision is made. A dataset was constructed for the axial piston pump design fault experiment, and four sets of transfer tasks were designed to compare with those of seven classic methods. The experimental results showed that the proposed MSASF method exhibits a superior domain adaptation effect and fault diagnosis performance. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd.",2-s2.0-85194904143
"Bearing fault diagnosis using a speed-adaptive network based on vibro-speed data fusion and majority voting Fault diagnosis of rolling bearings is key to maintain and repair modern rotating machinery. Rolling bearings are usually working in non-stationary conditions with time-varying loads and speeds. Existing diagnosis methods based on vibration signals only do not have the ability to adapt to rotational speed. And when the load changes, their accuracy rate will be obviously reduced. A method is put forward which fuses multi-modal sensor signals to fit speed information. Firstly, the features are extracted from raw vibration signals and instantaneous rotating speed signals, and fused by 1D-convolution neural network-based networks. Secondly, to improve the robustness of the model when the load changes, a majority voting mechanism is proposed in the diagnosis stage. Lastly, multiple variable speed samples of four bearings under three loads are obtained to evaluate the performance of the proposed method by analyzing the loss function, accuracy rate and F 1 score under different variable speed samples. It is empirically found that the proposed method achieves higher diagnostic accuracy and speed-adaptive ability than the algorithms based on vibration signal only. Moreover, a couple of ablation studies are also conducted to investigate the inner mechanism of the proposed speed-adaptive network. © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.",2-s2.0-85125741643

"A fault detection strategy for an ePump during EOL tests based on a knowledge-based vibroacoustic tool and supervised machine learning classifiers This paper presents a methodology for identifying faulty components in an electric pump during the end-of-line test based on accelerations and pressure pulsation data used to train an ensemble learning algorithm based on supervised machine learning classifiers. Despite various quality control measures in pump manufacturing, some out-of-tolerance components can pass through and end up on the assembly line, potentially leading to premature failure or abnormal noise during real-field operation. Because of the high impact, it is very important to put in place actions to mitigate the risk of delivering non-conform units, even if properly working in terms of pressure-flow rate performances. In this paper, an innovative knowledge-based vibroacoustic tool together with a machine learning built-in Python® library have been used to post-process acceleration and pressure pulsations data to generate features, which are then used to train, and test several supervised machine learning algorithms. The ensemble learning algorithm combines the best classifiers to identify healthy electric pump units with high accuracy, achieving above 95% accuracy in an experimental test campaign carried out on eighty electric pumps. Results are compared using principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction, and a sensor sensitivity study is conducted. © The Author(s) 2024.",2-s2.0-85183690582
"STAKgram: a method for optimal demodulation band selection in bearing fault diagnosis under complex interference Within rotating machinery, bearings constitute critical and vulnerable components. When they operate in a compromised state, they generate periodic shock pulses. While spectral kurtosis (SK) has been demonstrated as an effective tool for pulse detection, in complex operating environments, the vibration signals of damaged bearings acquired through sensors often contain a variety of interfering pulses, such as ambient background noise, episodic single pulses, which cause SK to produce poor computational results. In this paper, an innovative bearing fault diagnostic method named subband trimmed average kurtogram (STAKgram) is proposed, aiming to minimize the effect of interfering signals on signal processing results, thus ensuring reliable diagnostic results even in complex interference environments. Firstly, the signal is segmented into N sub-signals by employing a sliding window method. Following, the subband kurtosis is calculated for every sub-signal. Ultimately, the trimmed average kurtosis of the respective sub-band is computed to construct the STAKgram, indicating the optimal demodulation frequency band. It is used for squared envelope demodulation analysis. By simulation analysis and the application of test signals obtained under conditions closely resembling authentic bearing operating conditions, the STAKgram method is proven to provide more accurate results for diagnosing bearing faults in complex interference. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd.

"Three-dimensional hybrid fusion networks for current-based bearing fault diagnosis Intelligent fault diagnosis (IFD) techniques commonly use vibration-based measurements to perform health monitoring of critical rotating components in industrial systems. However, these vibration-based approaches may be limited in cost-sensitive applications, because the installation of vibration sensors is inconvenient and vibration sensors are expensive. Considering the difficulties of IFD using only current-related information from the motor current signal (MCS), this paper proposes a three-dimensional hybrid-fusion neural network (3D-HFN) that can automatically perform both data- and feature-level fusion of multi-phase current signals for MCS-based IFD of the rolling bearing. The 3D-HFN consists of the multivariate variational mode decomposition (MVMD) and an improved three-dimensional convolution neural network (3D-CNN). Firstly, MVMD is proposed to process multi-phase current signals, which adaptively acquire several intrinsic mode functions with mode-alignment properties. Subsequently, signal-to-image conversion and 3D stacking methods are used to construct 3D-like data in the current-phase dimension, which can fully preserve the interaction relationship between different phases using data-level fusion. Finally, an improved 3D-CNN with multiscale feature fusion and the smooth maximum unit is proposed to learn the 3D-like data and identify different health conditions for the rolling bearing. An open-source dataset with composite bearing faults is used to validate the merits of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed approach has achieved more reliable diagnosis performance than other hand-crafted or 2D/3D-CNN-based algorithms in MCS-based IFD of the rolling bearing. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.",2-s2.0-85177482359
"Prognostics and health management for piezoresistive pressure sensor based on improved gated recurrent unit networks Application fields for piezoresistive pressure sensors have become increasingly extensive in recent years. So a high reliability of the sensor is also required. However, considering that some sensors operate in hostile environments,the need to ensure continuous operation accuracy, prognostics, and health management (PHM) for piezoresistive pressure sensors should not be ignored. To solve this problem, a fault diagnosis and prognostic method that combines a support vector machine (SVM) and deep gated recurrent unit (DGRU) network optimized by hunter-prey optimization (HPO) is proposed in this paper. First, three sensor fault types are defined. Second, SVM is adopted to realize the fault diagnosis. Third, two layers of DGRU are employed to predict the health index, which is defined to represent the health state of the sensor. Meanwhile, the optimal parameters of the DGRU are optimized by HPO algorithms. Finally, the remaining useful life can be estimated by the predicted health index and failure threshold. The method proposed in this paper is proved to be effective and accurate. The fault diagnosis accuracy is 100% in the three fault types defined by this paper. The minimum mean absolute error is 6 × 10-5. It proves the proposed method of PHM in this paper is viable in a real application.  © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.",2-s2.0-85137683573
"Application of local and global interval embedding algorithms in uncertain system processes The data collected during the fault monitoring of industrial processes are often uncertain because of measurement noise, sensor error, and complex working environments. Currently, most of this uncertainty is transformed into interval-value data for processing. However, the traditional interval fault monitoring method (TIFMM) only considers the global information of the interval-valued data and only rarely considers the local neighborhood information, which can characterize the topological relationship between the interval-valued data points, so that the sample points with some nonlinear relationship still maintain this nonlinear relationship after dimensionality reduction. Therefore, to take into account both local and global information, a new interval-valued data projection algorithm called local and global interval embedding algorithms (LGIEA) is proposed in this paper. First, the measurement error estimation method, based on the principle of reasonable granularity, converts the imprecise variable measurement values into interval-value data that can reflect uncertainty. Then, an interval-matrix feature extraction method based on local and global information fusion, proposed in this paper, extracts process features by minimizing local scattering and maximizing global scattering of interval-valued data. Thereby, it preserves the optimal local neighborhood and global information in low-dimensional space. In addition, four statistical indicators and corresponding variable-contribution graphs have been defined to use online fault monitoring and fault variable identification. Finally, the superiority of the LGIEA was verified using simulation data of the Tennessee Eastman process and actual operating data of a shearer in an inclined-ditch coal mine. The experimental results show that, Compared with TIFMM such as midpoint-radius principal component analysis (PCA), complete information PCA and spectral radius-based interval PCA, proposed method significantly reduces the error alarm rate and the false monitoring rate and improves the accuracy of data classification. It also has better fault identification accuracy and robustness. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.",2-s2.0-85176772493

"Partially uncertain industrial process monitoring based on hybrid-scale wavelet signal fusion using crossed transformer In the monitoring of complex industrial processes, uncertainty arising from factors such as sensor degradation and environmental noise often leads to deviations in measurement data from true values, presenting significant challenges for fault detection. Typically, only a subset of variables is affected by uncertainty in real industrial systems. However, current methods generally assume that all variables exhibit uncertainty and apply uniform monitoring based solely on raw sampling data, neglecting the distinct characteristics of certain and uncertain data across different frequency scales. To address this issue, the paper proposes a hybrid-scale wavelet (HW) and crossed transformer (CT)-based adaptive multi-frequency signal fusion method for effective process monitoring of signals with partial uncertainty. The HW transformation is designed to handle the varying characteristics of certain and uncertain data across different frequency scales. The CT, which integrates both self-attention and mutual-attention mechanisms, is proposed to highlight the reliable features of uncertain signals by capturing the internal structures within each frequency band and learning feature interactions across different bands simultaneously. Finally, an adaptive weighted fusion strategy based on gated signals combines the enhanced multi-frequency signals, resulting in more accurate and reliable monitoring outcomes. Experiments conducted on the Tennessee Eastman process and wastewater treatment plant process demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in partially uncertain industrial processes monitoring. © 2025 IOP Publishing Ltd.

"Bispectral analysis and information fusion technique for bearing fault classification The feasibility and effectiveness of data fusion for the fault classification of bearing faults have been very well iterated in the literature. However, all previous endeavors have been limited to time, frequency, and time-frequency domain techniques. The use of higher-order spectral analysis (HOSA), especially Bispectrum and Trispectrum, for fault detection is gaining importance in recent studies due to the many advantages of HOSA. Bispectral features provide a valuable tool for capturing higher-order statistical relationships in signals, making them particularly effective in detecting nonlinearities and distinguishing between Gaussian and non-Gaussian data. Their robustness to noise and ability to reveal hidden information make them advantageous in applications such as vibration analysis, speech recognition, and image processing, where complex signal interactions and nonlinearity play a significant role in data interpretation and pattern recognition. This paper proposes a methodology for the fusion of the data from the vibration and the acoustic sensors for the fault detection of roller element bearings using bispectral features. Higher-order spectral characteristics are derived from vibration and acoustic sensor data, and they are fused using artificial neural networks and various other machine learning algorithms like support vector machine, K nearest neighbor, Naïve Bayes algorithm, and decision tree. This work primarily aims to evaluate the performance of each classifier when applied to the fused data, in contrast to the performance when using individual sensor data alone. The outcomes revealed that, even though the accuracy of the acoustic sensor data was lower in comparison to the vibration sensor data, which exhibited the highest performance of 100% accuracy with nearly all the classifiers, the fused data achieved remarkable results of 100% accuracy with artificial neural networks and decision trees. However, the Naïve Bayes algorithm yielded the lowest accuracy when applied to the fused data. The primary objective of this paper is to demonstrate the application of bispectrum analysis for data fusion and to enhance confidence in fault detection. It achieves this by maintaining the capability to accurately and dependably detect faults, even when a single sensor encounters issues or falls short of anticipated performance standards. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.",2-s2.0-85175709365
"A new method for remaining useful life prediction by implementing joint learning of sensor dynamic graph and spatio-temporal features Accurate implementation of remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of equipment is essential for health management and maintenance decisions. Advances in sensing and big data technologies have provided the possibility for research on data-driven life prediction methods. However, the current RUL prediction methods still need to improve in utilizing multi-source information. The present techniques consider more the relationship between the temporal information and RUL prediction among the multi-source information and rarely target the research and exploitation of the potential connection between sensor networks and RUL. Therefore, this paper proposes a spatio-temporal feature extraction network based on the sensor dynamic graph: DST-GT model. The method extracts the unidirectional relationship between sensors from monitoring data to construct a dynamic spatio-temporal graph reflecting the sensor relationship. The DST-GT model uses graph convolution based on message selection (MSGCN) to model the spatial dependencies of sensors, and uses multi-scale gated temporal convolution module (MGTCN) to model the temporal dependencies in sensor state monitoring data. In this paper, graph learning, graph convolution and temporal convolution modules are jointly learned in an end-to-end framework. The results on two widely used datasets and comparisons with other methods demonstrate the accuracy and advancement of DST-GT networks for RUL prediction. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.",2-s2.0-85162903705

"ODDformer: odd-even de-stationary and decomposition techniques transformer for aircraft engine remaining useful life prediction In the aerospace industry, accurately predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of aircraft engines is critical to reduce maintenance costs and increase safety. Existing RUL prediction algorithms fail to account for global temporal factors, overlook the non-stationary nature of monitored data, and neglect critical trends and seasonal characteristics. These factors directly affect the sensitivity of the forecast model to changes in the system state. In light of this, this study introduces an innovative end-to-end deep learning model, called odd-even de-stationary and decomposition transformer (ODDformer), specifically designed for accurate RUL prediction.

"Improved and accurate fault diagnostic model for gas turbine based on 2D-wavelet transform and generative adversarial network Severe working environments cause gas turbines to break down, which can directly affect their performance. Research on the diagnostic methods for gas turbine faults, such as, gas path faults and sensor failures, has always raised concerns. However, traditional fault diagnosis algorithms mostly use instantaneous data rather than time-series data, because they cannot efficiently use time-series analysis to extract fault features and improve algorithm accuracy.

However, aging and environmental condition cause sensors also be faulty, leading to incorrect interpretations of the collected data and subsequently resulting in erroneous machine health predictions. To mitigate this problem, this paper proposes a hybrid model that can differentiate between sensor and system faults.

Moreover, the RUL prediction uncertainty can be quantified using the prediction interval, which can be calculated by the ELCSRU model. The prediction performance of the ELCSRU model is demonstrated using a turbofan engine dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed ELCSRU model provides a prognosis framework with better prediction performance for quantifying RUL prediction uncertainty. © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.",2-s2.0-85138441872
"Fault-tolerant measurement mechanism research on pre-tightened four-point supported piezoelectric six-dimensional force/torque sensor High-precision and fault-tolerant six-dimensional force/torque sensor is one of the core components of intelligent robots for force feedback perception. This paper is aiming at the fault-tolerant measurement mechanism research on piezoelectric six-dimensional force/torque sensors with four-point support structure. Based on principle of leverage and deformation consistent, the fault-tolerant measurement mechanism of the pre-tightened four-point supported piezoelectric six-dimensional force/torque sensor is revealed. The mapping mathematical models of spatial six-dimensional force and four-fulcrum quartz crystal group detection signal for the sensor without signal fault and with signal fault are constructed respectively. The static calibration system of the sensor is built to realize the fault-tolerant static calibration experiment of the four-point supported piezoelectric six-dimensional force/torque sensor prototype under unidirectional loading without signal fault and with signal fault. In order to improve the measurement precision of six-dimensional force/torque sensor for robot, a decoupling method based on Genetic Algorithm to optimize Back Propagation algorithm (GABP) for piezoelectric six-dimensional force/torque sensor is adopted to solve the nonlinear cross coupling problem of multiple-input and multiple-output. Through Maltlab software, the test data are analyzed and calculated, and the percentage coupling error matrix of the sensor is calculated. The percentage coupling error is different when the sensor is fault-free and the fault-free measurement model is different. When the sensor is fault-free, the linearity of the sensor is the best and the maximum coupling error is less than 1.5%. When the sensor has any branch fault, the overall performance of the sensor is relatively weakened and the maximum coupling error increases. When the sensor has two branch faults, the linearity of the sensor is the worst. It cannot satisfy the requirement of accurate measurement. The research content is of great significance to the development and practicality of fault-tolerant multi-point supported piezoelectric six-dimensional force/torque sensor. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85073513225
"AdaClass filter and its application in bearing fault diagnosis The vibration signals recorded by the sensor reflect the operating state of bearings, and extracting recognizable features effectively from them has become a hot issue in fault diagnosis. Currently, signal processing based filtering methods have emerged as a popular approach for extracting fault-related features. However, conventional filters based on specified assumptions and theoretical models have limited adaptability to multiple types of bearings under different operating conditions, which can significantly impact the diagnostic results. Given this, a data-driven Adaptive Class (AdaClass) filter is proposed to extract the response characteristics of different categories within the latent space. The filter details are obtained by statistically analyzing the mean vectors of samples for each class in the reconstructed feature subspaces. Notably, the latent feature space is mapped by linear operators linear discriminant analysis and class-wise principal component analysis, where the data has a more concise feature representation and a more distinct feature structure. The low-dimensional projection operations enhance the differential information among different categories, and reorganize the internal structure within the same category. Furthermore, a bearing fault diagnosis model is developed based on the AdaClass filter banks, utilizing one-step convolution to improve the efficiency of feature extraction. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the competitors in terms of accuracy, time consumption, and noise resistance, especially for small sample scenarios. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd",2-s2.0-85184001029
"An attention-enhanced multi-modal deep learning algorithm for robotic compound fault diagnosis Compound fault diagnosis plays a critical role in lowering the maintenance time and cost of industrial robots. With the advance of deep learning and industrial big data, a compound fault diagnosis model can be established through a data-driven approach. However, current methods mainly focus on the single fault diagnosis of assets, which cannot achieve satisfactory performance for compound fault diagnosis. This study proposes a compound fault diagnosis algorithm for an industrial robot based on multi-modal feature extraction and fusion. Firstly, the multi-head self-attention enhanced convolution neural network module and long short-term memory network module are adopted to learn the fault-related features from different perspectives simultaneously. The local and global features extracted by the aforementioned modules are then fused for subsequent compound fault classification. An experimental study was implemented based on real-world robotic sensor data. The experimental results indicated that the proposed multi-modal algorithm shows merits in compound fault diagnosis in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods. © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.",2-s2.0-85141301584
"ALPF-GLRT based fault detection method for small faults applied to redundant IMUs Since small faults exhibit a very close magnitude to sensor noises, the probability of missing detection (PMD) in existing methods will increase sharply in the presence of small faults. To address such a problem, this paper proposes a novel fault detection method for small faults applied to redundant IMUs. First, this method introduces an adaptive low-pass filter (ALPF) into the general likelihood ratio test (GLRT) by filtering the parity residuals of the GLRT model, thereby reducing the disturbance of sensor noises on fault detection. Subsequently, since the introduction of ALPF leads to the changes of the parity residual statistics, the covariance of parity residual should be recalculated at the respective sample instant. Lastly, to theoretically prove the superiority of the proposed method for small faults, the minimum detection bias (MDB) is derived and calculated, thereby validating that the MDB of the proposed method is lower than that of the conventional GLRT method. As indicated from the simulation results, the PMD of the proposed method decreases significantly for small faults compared with the GLRT method and the Monte Carlo PMD of the proposed method is 0.1% under the fault with the magnitude of 1 sigma, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.  © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.",2-s2.0-85115931087
"Multi-sensor gearbox fault diagnosis using generalized minimum entropy deconvolution and main frequency center extraction Accurate diagnosis of gearbox faults is vital to maintain the stability and dependability of rotating machinery. In practical engineering scenarios, the installation of multiple sensors is often necessary to monitor numerous variables and gather extensive information. To effectively utilize the fault information from multiple sensors and improve fault diagnosis performance, this paper presents a gearbox fault diagnosis method using generalized minimum entropy deconvolution (GMED) and main frequency center extraction (MFCE). Firstly, the introduced GMED enhances the fault signals from multiple sensors through the maximization of standardized moments, offering advantages such as stability, wide applicability, and minimal parameter tuning requirements. Subsequently, the proposed MFCE is employed to extract features. MFCE selects main spectral lines and derives a novel feature metric named main frequency center. This not only further reduces the influence of interfering components, but also requires the extraction of only 2 n features (where n is the number of sensors) to achieve a high fault recognition rate, while remaining compatible with multiple classical classifiers. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method are demonstrated through experimental results on two gearbox fault datasets. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.",2-s2.0-85175402398
"Multi-feature fusion-based TCA-WKNN cross-sensor fault diagnosis method for dynamic weighing The outstanding performance of current machine-learning fault diagnosis methods is mainly attributed to the availability of a large amount of labeled training data. However, in practical dynamic weighing systems, the high costs and variability of operating conditions limit the availability of reliable training data, hampering engineering fault diagnoses in dynamic weighing systems. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel cross-sensor fault diagnosis method based on multi-feature fusion using a transfer component analysis (TCA)-weighted k-nearest-neighbor (WKNN) network. Using this method, time- and frequency-domain features are extracted from a laboratory-simulated set of fault data with small batches of real operational data. Source and target domain features are fused, and TCA is applied to map the source and target domain samples to a latent space using kernel functions to reduce the distribution differences among the samples. Finally, the WKNN is employed as a metric learner to enhance small-sample data matching and classification to improve diagnostic accuracy. The results show that with three samples per support set, the proposed method achieves a diagnostic accuracy of 93.33%. Compared with other approaches, the proposed method exhibits stronger generalizability for diagnostic knowledge transference from sensor to dynamic weighing failure data, effectively improving precision in on-site small-sample environments and reducing sample imbalances. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd",2-s2.0-85176435424
"Integrated deep learning models to predict future vibrations on the discharge ring of a river-type hydroelectric power plant Hydroelectric power plants (HPPs) are critical for sustainable energy generation, but their maintenance and operational stability are often compromised by structural vibrations, particularly in key components like the discharge ring units. Predicting these vibrations in advance is essential to prevent damage, enhance operational efficiency, and extend the lifespan of HPP components. This paper presents two advanced deep learning models designed to predict future vibrations in the discharge ring of river-type HPPs. By combining multiple deep learning architectures, the proposed models process complex sensor data to accurately predict vibration patterns. The models employ the hybrid compositions of deep learning models specifically optimized for time-series prediction of mechanical stresses. In this study, vibration patterns of five distinct HPP turbine units (TUs) are modeled with a hybrid approach and comprehensive analyses are provided for each TU. Validation of the developed models with real-world operating data from HPPs reveals the proposed models’ accuracy, resilience, and potential for predicting future vibration signals. The proposed models achieve significant improvement in predictive accuracy over traditional methods, providing a reliable tool for early detection of vibration-induced risks in hydroelectric power infrastructure. The proposed models achieved minimum error rates with mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.025, mean squared error (MSE) of 0.006, R2 of 0.999 and root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.080 for convolutional neural network + bidirectional long-short term memory (CNN + BiLSTM) and MAE of 0.038, MSE of 0.008, R2 of 0.994 and RMSE of 0.089 for CNN + gated recurrent unit.

"A similarity-based remaining useful life prediction method using multimodal degradation features and adjusted cosine similarity When a large amount of full life-cycle data are available, similarity-based methods are the preferred method for remaining useful life (RUL) prediction due to their reliability and accuracy. Traditional similarity-based RUL prediction methods use a single model and single-scale degradation features, which are incapable of fully capturing the degradation behavior of the system. Additionally, the similarity of spatial orientation is neglected in the similarity-matching process. To fill these research gaps, a novel method is developed based on multimodal degradation features and adjusted cosine similarity (ACS) to tackle complex-system RUL prediction in this paper. Complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise is employed to decouple global degradation and random fluctuations in run-to-failure sensor data. Slow feature analysis is utilized to obtain local degradation features, and residual terms are used as global degradation features. Then, multimodal degradation features are transformed into one-dimensional health degradation indicators by bidirectional gated recurrent unit autoencoder. An ACS is developed to estimate the matching similarity between the test degradation curve and the training degradation curve. The proposed scheme captures the time-varying multimodal degradation behavior and provides libraries of health curves with multiple degradation patterns. The designed scheme is evaluated on the C-MAPSS dataset and the results illustrate the competitiveness and effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.",2-s2.0-85164591411
"Pioneering CPMI framework for accurate state-of-health assessment in Lithium ion battery power management using FBG sensors Continuous monitoring of the State of Health (SOH) in Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries is crucial for ensuring operational reliability and safety in powered devices. This paper presents a novel Classifier-Pursued Maintenance Index Scheme (CPMI) that leverages Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensor measurements for sustainable SOH monitoring and maintenance scheduling. The CPMI framework processes real-time temperature and strain measurements from strategically placed FBG sensors during charge-discharge cycles to estimate battery capacity degradation and determine maintenance requirements. The proposed system employs a support vector-based classification algorithm that categorizes operational states based on FBG sensor data streams, identifying deviations from optimal temperature and voltage ranges. This classification approach generates a quantitative maintenance index that enables systematic assessment scheduling rather than arbitrary inspections. Experimental validation over 200 charge-discharge cycles demonstrates the CPMI system's effectiveness, achieving a maintenance state identification accuracy of 0.95, 75 % classification success rate, classification latency of 0.1 s, precision exceeding 0.95, and an assessment reliability of 0.98.

"Blind extraction of acoustic signals from rolling bearing composite faults based on ISCA-IMCKD In production practice, the signal gathered by a sensor often includes strong ambient noise, and its composition is complex. Focusing on the problem that traditional methods are difficult to separate and extract fault frequencies from strong background noise, a novel compound fault blind extraction method based on improved sparse component analysis (ISCA) and improved maximum correlation kurtosis deconvolution (IMCKD)-named ISCA‐IMCKD- is suggested. Initially, the signal that the sensor has collected is shifted into time-frequency area signal by short-time Fourier transform (STFT). In addition, the single source domain characteristic data is screened by improved single source point detection to determine the number of sources. Second, the ISCA method is optimized by using cosine distance improved fuzzy C-means clustering, which is utilized to further process the characteristic data to calculate the mixing matrix. Moreover, the estimated source signal is initially extracted according to the membership degree of clustering results. Finally, the estimated source signal is shifted into the time area by inverse STFT transform, and the IMCKD is employed to enhance the characteristics of the projected source signals. Meanwhile, the initially estimated source signal is completely separated, and the defect frequencies of the composite faults are finally extracted by envelope analysis. Simulation experiments and measured data are employed to certify the viability of the proposed means. The defect detection of rolling bearings is finished while the time cost is significantly saved. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd",2-s2.0-85167865358
"Research on mechanical fault diagnosis based on MADS evidence fusion theory In machine intelligence fault diagnostic and health status decision-making systems, rich, complex, and fuzzy feature information cannot facilitate fault decision-making merely on a single data source. This requires utilizing the heterogeneity of information gathered from multiple sources to diminish the system’s uncertainty and improve the accuracy of decision-making. In this work, a novel neural network-based multi-source fusion classification model is proposed to diagnose the pump mechanical faults. The multi-head attention Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence fusion (MADS) system extends the model’s ability to focus on rich features. Furthermore, the uncertain values throwing mechanism can effectively eliminate samples from uncertain categories and increase the model’s ability to distinguish diagnostic results with low confidence. Compared with a single sensor, our multi-sensor joint decision based on seven sensors considerably improved the fault diagnostic accuracy of MADS system, which has increased by at least 12.34%. Experimental validation demonstrates that utilizing the improved combination rules provided for multi-source evidence fusion fault diagnosis can significantly improve the efficacy of conventional D-S fusion and reduce the probability of misjudgment; combining the multi-head attention mechanism can dramatically increase the precision of model fault diagnosis.

"Multi-sensor bearing remaining life prediction method based on bidirectional temporal convolutional capsule network fusion attention mechanism Aiming at the shortcomings of existing deep learning life prediction methods in long time series feature extraction and the impact of the complexity of bearing working conditions on life assessment, a data fusion remaining useful life prediction method based on the bi-directional temporal convolutional capsule fusion attention mechanism (Bi-TCC) is proposed. Bi-TCC employs a dual-channel structure to process forward and backward time-series data separately in order to comprehensively capture the full life cycle characteristics of bearing, especially the late degradation trends. The forward channel adopts an improved temporal convolution network (TCN) to extract shallow time series information, and combines the multi-scale attention mechanism to focus on both local and global features, and enhances the spatial hierarchy learning through a one-dimensional (1D) causal capsule network.

"A novel multivariate signal processing-based fault diagnosis approach of rotating machinery under various operating conditions Compared with signals collected by the single sensor, the collected multivariate signals contain more information to reflect the state of mechanical equipment, which has a positive effect on fault diagnosis. However, different acquisition channels and various operating conditions interfere with the extraction of fault features of rotating machinery. To solve this problem, taking rolling bearings as an example in this paper, a novel method is adopted to alleviate these interferences and combined with an improved extreme learning machine (ELM) to achieve intelligent fault diagnosis of rolling bearings under various operating conditions. First, adaptive projection intrinsically transformed multivariate empirical mode decomposition is used to decompose multivariate signals and obtain intrinsic mode functions of each channel to construct feature matrices. Then, nuisance attribute projection (NAP) is employed to alleviate the interference components in the feature matrix, which are originated from different channels and operating conditions. Finally, vectors belonging to the processed feature matrix as samples are input into the proposed weighted extreme learning machine (WELM) for intelligent fault classification. The weighted matrix of the WELM can compress the dimension of the sample and extract sensitive features, and the effectiveness of the proposed fault diagnosis model via the above methods is verified by experiments. Furthermore, comparative experiments show that the proposed fault diagnosis model has higher accuracy than the model combined with NAP and traditional single-hidden layer feedforward neural network or ELM. Therefore, the proposed fault diagnosis model may potentially aid experts on fault diagnosis of rotating machinery under various operating conditions.  © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.",2-s2.0-85128617961
"Fault prediction of electronic devices based on attention mechanism time-series point process In recent years, with the development of high-precision sensors, computer technology and artificial intelligence, it makes the data-driven intelligent fault warning and diagnosis method gradually become a research hotspot. Aiming at the low utilization of fault diagnosis information of complex electronic devices and the problems of convergence and training time of traditional neural network fault diagnosis models, a point-in-time process generation model without using intensity function is proposed. The model uses the Wasserstein distance to construct the loss function, which facilitates the measurement of the deviation between the model distribution and the true distribution, and uses a self-concern mechanism to describe the degree of influence of the historical events on the current events, which makes the model interpretable and more capable of generalization. Comparative experiments show that without a priori information about the intensity function, the method reduces the relative error rate by 3.59 %, improves the fault prediction accuracy by 3.91 %, and has a better overall fit than the RNN-like generative model and the great likelihood model.

"A novel residual graph representation learning method towards multi-source data fusion and fault diagnosis of machinery The harmonic reducer, a critical component in industrial mechanical systems, is responsible for high-precision motion transmission. Timely fault detection and diagnosis are essential to prevent catastrophic safety incidents and ensure system reliability. However, existing fault diagnosis methods often fail to fully utilize the rich information embedded in multi-source data, leading to suboptimal performance. Additionally, the interactions and dependencies between different data channels remain inadequately captured, hindering accurate fault identification. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel fault diagnosis framework based on residual graph representation learning and multi-source data fusion. The proposed model monitors the harmonic reducer’s operational state using a multi-sensor network. A signal preprocessing module, leveraging fast fourier transform and RadiusGraph, transforms raw multi-sensor data into a graph structure, where nodes represent sensor channels and weighted edges capture interdependencies. This graph structure effectively reflects the interaction and dependency among multi-channel data. For feature extraction, we propose a bi-layer ChebyNet with residual connections to mine and update the relationships between sensor data while addressing challenges such as gradient vanishing or explosion in deep graph neural networks. Finally, the learned graph representations are used to classify fault types, enabling precise identification of potential faults or anomalies in the harmonic reducer. To validate the proposed method, we conducted fault experiments under various laboratory conditions, simulating six types of faults commonly encountered in real-world scenarios, including gear tooth breakage, bearing faults, and flexspline issues. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves superior fault diagnosis performance compared to existing methods, as evidenced by higher classification accuracy, F1 scores, and improved confusion matrix metrics.

"Multiscale global and local self-attention-based network for remaining useful life prediction Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction plays an important role in prognostics and health management (PHM) and can significantly enhance equipment reliability and safety in various engineering applications. Accurate RUL prediction enables proactive maintenance planning, helping prevent potential hazards and economic losses caused by equipment failures. Recently, while deep learning-based methods have swept the RUL prediction field, most existing methods still have difficulties in simultaneously extracting multiscale global and local degradation feature information from raw multi-sensor monitoring data. To address these issues, we propose a novel multiscale global and local self-attention-based network (MGLSN) for RUL prediction. MGLSN consists of global and local feature extraction subnetworks based on self-attention, which work in parallel to simultaneously extract the global and local degradation features of equipment and can adaptively focus on more important parts. While the global network captures long-term dependencies between time steps, the local network focuses on modeling local temporal dynamics. The design of parallel feature extraction can avoid the mutual influence of information from global and local aspects. Moreover, MGLSN adopts a multiscale feature extraction design (multiscale self-attention and convolution) to capture the global and local degradation patterns at different scales, which can be combined to better reflect the degradation trend. Experiments on the widely used Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (CMAPSS), New CMAPSS (N-CMAPSS), and International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management 2008 challenge datasets provided by NASA show that MGLSN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RUL prediction methods and has great application prospects in the field of PHM. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd",2-s2.0-85173575669
"Hierarchical graph neural network with adaptive cross-graph fusion for remaining useful life prediction Multi-sensor monitoring data provide abundant information resources for complex machine systems, which facilitates monitoring the degradation process of machinery and ensuring the reliability of the industrial process. However, previous prognostic methods focus more on the sequential data obtained from multi-sensors, while ignoring the underlying prior structural information of the equipment. To fully leverage the structural information into the modeling process, and thus improve the remaining useful life (RUL) prediction performance, a hierarchical graph neural network with adaptive cross-graph fusion (HGNN-ACGF) method for RUL prediction is proposed in this study. In the HGNN-ACGF method, a hierarchical graph consisting of a sensor graph and a module graph is constructed by introducing the structural information to fully model the degradation trend information of the complex machine system. Besides, the graph neural network (GNN) is adopted to learn the representation at both the module graph and sensor graph, and an adaptive cross-graph fusion (ACGF) block is proposed. Owing to the cross-graph fusion block, the representation from different graphs can be fused adaptively by considering the relative importance between different modules and sensors.

"Competitive degradation process based monitoring of steer-by-wire system under unknown degradation features Monitoring of steer-by-wire (SBW) system under intermittent faults is challenging since it is difficult to obtain the priori knowledge of monotonous degradation feature of intermittent fault due to its stochastic nature. To deal with this issue, this paper develops a prognosis method for the SBW system under unknown degradation features based on the concept of competitive degradation process (CDP). With the aid of fault diagnosis module, the possible faulty components can be determined, where the fault isolation estimators and the expanded analytical redundancy relations are used to improve the isolabilities of sensor faults. For each faulty component, three degradation features are defined and the monotonicity of each feature is unknown beforehand. To judge the monotonicity of the feature, the competition index is developed in the CDP and the feature is applicable (i.e. monotonous) if the predefined criterion can be satisfied using the established dataset of the feature. Once the applicable features are determined, the corresponding degradation models are built for remaining useful life prediction. Experiment results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed method. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd.

"An integrated approach combining randomized kernel PCA, Gaussian mixture modeling and ICA for fault detection in non-linear processes Principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA), as well as their kernel extensions, have been widely applied in the past for industrial fault detection with Gaussian or non-Gaussian process data with linear or non-linear characteristics. Kernel-based techniques lead to computational complexity due to the high dimensionality of the dataset in the feature space. In this work, a randomization approach is used to obtain a low-rank approximation of the high-dimensional kernel matrix. A hybrid machine learning technique is proposed that integrates randomized kernel PCA (RKPCA) with ICA and Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM). The proposed approach, ICA-RKPCA-GMM, addresses the Gaussian and non-Gaussian characteristics of non-linear process data. Another hybrid algorithm combining three basic techniques of ICA, PCA and GMM is also developed (ICA-PCA-GMM). The fault detection performances of the proposed techniques (ICA-RKPCA-GMM and ICA-PCA-GMM) are compared with PCA, ICA, KPCA and combined ICA-PCA techniques by applying the techniques to two benchmark systems. Monitoring performances were evaluated by determining the false alarm rate and fault detection rate for different types of process and sensor faults. The simulation results show that the proposed ICA-RKPCA-GMM approach yields better results than individual ICA, PCA and KPCA techniques, the combined ICA-PCA and the proposed ICA-PCA-GMM technique. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd.",2-s2.0-85190733928
"Operation stage division and RUL prediction of bearings based on 1DCNN-ON-LSTM Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of bearings is significantly important to ensure reliable operation of bearings. In practice, it is routinely impossible to obtain the full life cycle degradation data of bearings that needs to be used in prediction. The accuracy of the RUL prediction of bearings is often affected by incomplete degradation data. Regarding this situation, this paper proposes a multi-sensor three-stage RUL prediction framework based on the one-dimensional convolutional ordered neuron long short-term memory (1DCNN-ON-LSTM) neural network. Firstly, 1DCNN is used to extract spatial features adaptively from multi-sensor’s data and fuse them into one-dimensional feature. Next, the unsupervised hierarchy mechanism of time series information based ON-LSTM is developed to determine the ‘initial degradation stage point’ and ‘rapid degradation stage point’ of the bearing from the one-dimensional feature. Once the signal features collected by sensors input to the model reach the degradation stage point, select the corresponding sensitive features as input and construct the 1DCNN-ON-LSTM model that performs RUL prediction after the degradation stage point to improve the prediction accuracy of the model. Based on the proposed hierarchy mechanism, the bearings’ operation process is divided into three operation stages: normal stage, initial degradation stage and rapid degradation stage. Finally, the experiments verify that the proposed method can effectively divide the operation stages of bearings to predict the RUL and improve the generalization ability and prediction accuracy of the model. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.",2-s2.0-85178641713
"Sensor fault diagnosis for uncertain dissimilar redundant actuation system of more electric aircraft via bond graph and improved principal component analysis This paper develops a sensor condition monitoring method integrating the model-based bond graph (BG) technique and data-driven principal component analysis (PCA) for the dissimilar redundant actuation system of more electric aircraft with uncertain parameters. The uncertain dissimilar redundant actuation system is modeled by BG in linear fractional transformation form. After that, the analytical redundancy relations containing the nominal part and the uncertain part can be derived, based on which the adaptive thresholds and the fault signature matrix (FSM) can be obtained for robust fault detection and fault isolation. To improve the fault isolation performance under the multiple faults condition, a new fault isolation method integrating FSM and improved PCA (IPCA) is developed, where the possible fault set generated from the FSM is further refined by the IPCA module with an improved reconstruction algorithm and cyclic PCA monitoring model to achieve a more efficient fault isolation result. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by simulation investigations. © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.",2-s2.0-85141296280
"Fault diagnosis method for machinery based on multi-source conflict information fusion Multi-source information fusion diagnosis is usually more reliable than fault diagnosis with a single source employed. However, fusion results may be absurd when fusing highly conflicting information. To address this problem, the Dempster-Shafer (DS) evidence theory is updated by weighting each piece of evidence according to the corresponding contribution to the decision, and a novel fault diagnosis method based on multi-source conflict information fusion is proposed. First, the basic probability assignment of evidence corresponding to the sensor information is given by introducing the feature parameters of electromyographic signals and using the back-propagation neural network. Then, the importance of each piece of evidence is determined by solving the difference degree and exclusion degree among the evidence, and the evidence is assigned weights according to the degree of importance of each piece of evidence in the fusion decision-making process. Next, the weighted evidence is combined for making decisions and further diagnosis after weighted averaging of the evidence with different weights. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The experimental results show that the areas under the ROC curves for the proposed method are 0.3229, 0.0729 and 0.9271 higher than those of the traditional DS method, Murphy’s method and Yager’s method, respectively, which proves that the proposed method has better diagnostic performance and reliability. © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.",2-s2.0-85136154416
"Separation of sun gear crack signals based on homologous response fragment mining and common component reconstruction The operational state of the sun gear in the planetary gearbox significantly impacts the stability and reliability of the entire transmission system. This study introduces a novel method to enhance the precision of diagnosing faults in the sun gear of a planetary gearbox. By detecting the similarity and distribution patterns of specific length segments in vibration signals, we identify homologous response segments based on the variation of fault meshing points and sensor positions. We then utilize robust principal component analysis (Robust PCA) to reduce data dimensionality and extract low-dimensional information from these segments.

"Pre-classified reservoir computing for the fault diagnosis of 3D printers Fault diagnosis is crucial for the printing quality assurance of a 3D printer. This paper presents a pre-classified reservoir computing (PCRC) method to diagnose the health condition of a 3D printer using the data collected by a low-cost attitude sensor. As the data from the low-cost attitude sensor often contain a large amount of interference information, it is difficult to accurately diagnose the printer condition. As such, a pre-classification strategy is proposed to reduce the intra-class distance by aggregating information labels of the same condition. Echo state network is then employed as a reservoir computing (RC) tool for applying data-driven based artificial intelligence to extract faulty features and to classify condition patterns simultaneously. The proposed PCRC method is evaluated using experimental data collected from the 3D printer. An optimal PCRC model is developed by tuning model parameters using experimental data. The advantages of the PCRC are demonstrated by comparing with other methods such as RC, random forest, support vector machine and spare auto-encoder. Due to the combined and compounded effect of the pre-classification strategy and RC modelling, the proposed method leads to the highest accuracy in fault diagnosis of the 3D printer with limited low-cost sensor data and relatively small datasets, without relying on physical domain knowledge. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85086638624
"Multi-channel data fusion and intelligent fault diagnosis based on deep learning In complex manufacturing systems, multi-channel sensor data are usually recorded for fault detection and diagnosis. Most existing multi-channel data processing methods adopt tensor analysis technology, which cannot effectively describe the temporal and spatial structures of the multi-channel data. The obstacles in multi-channel data analysis are the temporal correlation between the time-series data of the single-channel and the spatial correlation between different channels. In this paper, a novel deep convolutional neural network model is proposed for multi-channel data fusion and intelligent fault diagnosis. First, features of the multi-channel data are extracted from two scales. The extracted features are then fused through a multi-layer neural network. Finally, a classifier of fault modes is established by using the improved Softmax function. The fault diagnosis performance of the proposed model is evaluated and compared with other common methods in both the simulation studies and real-world case studies.

"A method for rolling bearing fault diagnosis based on GSC-MDRNN with multi-dimensional input The traditional fault diagnosis methods for rolling bearings through neural networks mostly use data sources collected by a single sensor and use single-dimensional data input, leading to fault features in bearings not be completely extracted. Moreover, traditional convolution often uses single-size convolution kernels, which are insufficient for fault feature extraction. In response to these problems, the global shortcut connection (GSC)-multichannel deep ResNet network model is proposed. First, a new residual structure, the GSC, is proposed to fuse two-dimensional and one-dimensional signal features. Second, involution is introduced into the field of fault diagnosis to address the problem of insufficient network feature extraction caused by using single-size convolution kernels. In addition, a convolutional block attention module can adaptively assign the weight of each channel feature to achieve adaptive channel fusion.

"Unsupervised rolling bearing fault diagnosis method across working conditions based on multiscale convolutional neural network In practical engineering, the features of rolling bearing vibration signals often vary in distribution under different working conditions, and obtaining sample labels for target working conditions can be challenging. Therefore, a multi-scale depth subdomain adaptive convolutional neural network (MS-DSACNN) fault diagnosis method is proposed. The MS-DSACNN method is based on a multi-scale feature extraction method combined with an improved 1D-ConvNeXt architecture, which fuses low- and high-level features into multi-scale fault features. A channel attention mechanism is also introduced to adaptively assign weights to the fused multi-scale features. The local maximum mean discrepancy is constructed by extracting features and their corresponding source and pseudo-label inputs for the source and target working conditions, respectively, to construct the loss function for backpropagation. The MS-DSACNN model was evaluated in experiments with two different loads and one variable speed dataset.

"A fault diagnosis approach for flange stabilizer based on multi-signal fusion As an essential means of energy transportation, pipelines have been widely used in various fields. However, many external factors such as vibration and corrosion can cause damage at the flange part, which seriously affects the safety of pipeline transportation. Quite a number of methods for troubleshooting at pipeline flanges have been continuously proposed, yet there is little research on diagnostic methods for the stabilizer at the flange. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the stabilizer of the flange and a method that combines traditional detection and machine learning with each other to detect stabilizer faults is proposed. At first, we can obtain a stable and reliable diagnostic data by combining the advantages of the preload of the bolt and the acoustic signal. Subsequently, the optimized N-Beats model is trained based on the measured bolt preload data to predict the service state of the stabilizer. Finally, the data measured by the sensors as well as the predicted data are analyzed by a simplified classification algorithm to determine whether a fault has occurred and to classify the fault. The fault detection method used in this paper not only improves the accuracy of detection and shortens the fault detection time, but also improves the automation level of pipeline inspection.

"A novel vibro-acoustic fault diagnosis approach of planetary gearbox using intrinsic wavelet integrated GE-EfficientNet Planetary gearbox operates under complex working conditions involving high speed, heavy load, and corrosion. When the planetary gearbox is in tight spaces, it is difficult to measure its signal by conventional methods. In this case, acoustic sensors can measure signal with the noncontact method. This paper proposes a vibro-acoustic fault diagnosis method with respect to planetary gearbox. The method addresses challenges related to weak vibro-acoustic signal, difficulty in extracting fault features, and low diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Firstly, vibro-acoustic signal is captured by a unidirectional microphone. Next, intrinsic wavelet analysis extracts intrinsic features of the planetary gears. The band-limited intrinsic mode functions (BLIMFs) of the acoustic signal are obtained by optimized variational mode decomposition, and the BLIMFs are then transformed into time-frequency map features. Finally, these time-frequency map features are utilized as the inputs for Ghost module and Efficient channel attention module (GE)-improved EfficientNet model, namely GE-EfficientNet model, to achieve fault diagnosis of planetary gearbox. The superiority of the proposed method is verified by the experimental results which show that the diagnostic accuracy of GE-EfficientNet reached 100%, and the floating-point operations and parameter numbers are only 5.1 G and 0.4 MB, respectively. The results demonstrate that the proposed vibro-acoustic fault diagnosis method achieves good diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.",2-s2.0-85177992968

"A novel dynamic predictive maintenance framework for gearboxes utilizing nonlinear Wiener process In the context of advancing industrial automation, gearboxes, as pivotal components in power transmission systems, have a direct bearing on the operational efficiency and safety of the entire machinery. This study introduces a novel dynamic predictive maintenance (PdM) framework for gearboxes using a nonlinear Wiener process. Comprehensive experiments validate the framework, demonstrating significant reductions in maintenance costs and improvements in reliability. First, a full-life degradation experiment was executed on the gearbox, leveraging the root mean square value of the vibration signal as an indicator of system degradation. Subsequently, the signals from four vibration sensors were synthesized and normalized through kernel principal component analysis, thereby enabling a more nuanced representation of the gearbox’s degradation profile. The degradation trajectory was then modeled using a nonlinear Wiener process framework. The Wiener process’s parameters and state variables were iteratively refined utilizing an online filtering algorithm grounded in Bayesian inference. This facilitated the derivation of the probability density function for the remaining useful life (RUL), thereby enabling a robust prediction of the gearbox’s RUL. Finally, to minimize maintenance costs per unit of time, an optimization model for dynamic maintenance decision-making was formulated. The optimal maintenance timing was ascertained by solving this model. The empirical findings of this investigation demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in executing dynamic PdM for gearboxes.

"Attention features selection oversampling technique (AFS-O) for rolling bearing fault diagnosis with class imbalance When using data-driven methods for fault diagnosis of mechanical rotating components such as gears and bearings, there is a problem of class imbalance in the lifecycle data collected by sensors. The most commonly used method to address this issue is the synthetic minority over-sampling technique, which synthesizes samples in the feature space, but its blind synthesis may lead to redundant features in the synthetic samples. To avoid this deficiency, this paper proposes a feature-weighted oversampling method called AFS-O (Attention Features Selection Oversampling Technique). First, time-frequency domain features are extracted from the full lifecycle data of bearings to construct an initial subset of features, which serves the input to AFS. Then, AFS is then used to obtain the distribution of feature selection patterns and generate feature weights to determine the inclusion or exclusion of each feature, thereby constructing an optimal subset of features. Finally, the optimal feature subset is synthetically oversampled to achieve class-balanced data, which is then fed into a classifier. AFS-O is applied to the rolling bearing accelerated lifetime dataset from Xi’an Jiaotong University. Experimental results demonstrate that AFS-O outperforms other state-of-the-art synthetic oversampling algorithms in terms of Gmean, F 2 score , and Recall, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.",2-s2.0-85179883225
"Spatial weighted graph-driven fault diagnosis of complex process industry considering technological process flow Each chemical process industry system possesses unique process knowledge, which serves as a representation of the system’s state. As graph-theory based methods are capable of embedding process knowledge, they have become increasingly crucial in the field of process industry diagnosis. The fault representation ability of the diagnosis model is directly associated with the quality of the graph. Unfortunately, simple fully connected graphs fail to strengthen the internal connections within the same process but weaken the interactive connections between different processes. Moreover, each node in the graph is considered equally important, making it impossible to prioritize crucial system monitoring indicators. To address the above shortcomings, this paper presents a spatial weighted graph (SWG)-driven fault diagnosis method of complex process industry considering technological process flow. Initially, the physical space sensor layout of the technological process flow is mapped into the spatial graph structure, where each sensor is regarded as a node and these nodes are connected by the k nearest neighbor algorithm. Subsequently, according to the mechanism knowledge, the sensors in the process are divided into different importance categories and weight coefficients are assigned to their nodes. The similarities between these weighted nodes are calculated, and the resulting edge information are used to construct the SWGs. Finally, the SWGs are input to a graph convolutional network, facilitating fault representation learning for fault diagnosis of complex process industry. Validation experiments are conducted using public industrial datasets, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively integrate the process knowledge to improve the fault diagnosis accuracy of the model. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.",2-s2.0-85173106512
"A fault diagnosis method based on feature-level fusion of multi-sensor information for rotating machinery Traditionally, most fault diagnosis work on rotating machinery is carried out on single sensor datasets. However, the single feature source may suffer from missing or inaccurate features, which is especially sluggish for fault diagnosis tasks under noise interference. Feature-level fusion of multi-sensor information can obtain more comprehensive and abundant feature information, while improving the feature discrimination. Therefore, through feature-level fusion of multi-sensor information, a parallel multi-scale attentional convolutional neural network (PMSACNN) is proposed in this paper to achieve rotating machinery fault diagnosis. A dilated wide convolutional layer is designed to extract the short-time features of signals with noise by performing sparse sampling on them. The multi-scale structure is constructed to capture the diversity feature information of signals, and the feature-level stitching of multi-sensor information is realized by the parallel input mechanism. Feature fusion is achieved by adaptively correcting the importance of different channel features by using channel attention. The global averaging pooling operation is introduced to reduce the number of parameters and improve the efficiency of the model operation. The effectiveness of PMSACNN is verified by using the bearing dataset acquired from the mechanical comprehensive diagnosis simulation platform.

"A novel collaborative bearing fault diagnosis method based on multi-scale dynamic fusion network under speed fluctuating condition Improving bearing fault diagnosis accuracy under speed fluctuation is a challenge in engineering applications. With the development of big data processing technology, a new solution, multi-sensor complementary information, has emerged. However, single-scale dimension compression, which is adopted in most multi-sensor data fusion methods, captures only a small amount of valuable information. To deal with this deficiency, a multi-scale dynamic fusion network (MSDFN) is proposed. First, considering the existence of non-stationary features in the fluctuating speed signal, the FReLU function is adopted to activate the features after considering contextual information. Then, multi-sensor features are fused by multiple scales to obtain richer feature information, and fusion features at different scales are weighted by using the attention mechanism. Finally, batch normalization is employed to standardize the variable speed feature distribution. The validity of the MSDFN is proved by conducting fault diagnosis experiments on two bearings under speed fluctuating conditions.

"Denoising graph attention wavelet network: an interpretable multi-sensor information fusion diagnostic method for rotating systems The strong noise and black-box nature of deep networks pose great challenges to the efficiency of utilizing multi-sensor data for fault diagnosis. To solve these issues, a denoising graph attention wavelet network (DGAWN) is proposed for multi-sensor information fusion fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. Considering the spatial relationship of multi-sensor measurement points, k-neighborhood graphs are first constructed to characterize the intrinsic association and topology of each sensor data. The graph attention mechanism is introduced into the DGAWN to enhance the feature mapping relationship of multi-sensor graph nodes. Importantly, a denoising graph wavelet convolution layer is developed by utilizing a graph wavelet operator followed by an adaptive thresholding denoising module, thus obtaining interpretable graph wavelet filter responses and enhancing noise immunity.

"Multi-sensor data fusion and bidirectional-temporal attention convolutional network for remaining useful life prediction of rolling bearing Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is crucial in the field of engineering, which can reduce the frequency of accidents and the maintenance cost of machinery. With the increasing complexity of rotating machinery, the data analysis methods based on deep learning have become the mainstream methods of prediction work. However, most of the current RUL prediction methods only use single-sensor data as input, which cannot effectively use multi-sensor data. In addition, as an advanced deep learning prediction method, temporal convolutional network (TCN) only uses the past time information of vibration data to determine the current health status of bearings, while ignoring the importance of future time information of vibration data. To solve the above problems, a bearing RUL prediction method based on multi-sensor data fusion and bidirectional-temporal attention convolutional network (Bi-TACN) is proposed in this paper. In multi-sensor data fusion, multi-sensor data are combined into multi-channel data, and a channel-weighted attention is designed to emphasize the importance of each sensor data. Compared with traditional multi-sensor data fusion, the proposed fusion method allows deep prediction networks to learn more useful feature information from multi-sensor data. Then, Bi-TACN is developed to predict the RUL of bearings. Bi-TACN is mainly composed of the forward TCN block and the backward TCN block, both of which can learn the past and future time information of multi-sensor data simultaneously. Moreover, a temporal attention mechanism is embedded in Bi-TACN to adaptively calibrate the weights of the two TCN blocks, so as to achieve dynamic feature fusion of past and future time information.

"Identification of compound faults of rolling bearing based on envelope-cross-correlation and improved 1D-LBP Faults in bearings are often represented as compound faults in practical engineering. It is far more difficult to extract compound faults than single ones, and the influence which is from component signals irrelevant to fault, and transient impulses caused by the defective bearing are likely to be overwhelmed; this challenges the exact judgment of compound faults of bearings. 1D local binary pattern (1D-LBP) can extract hidden information from the perspective of local features. However, the quantization of signals according to 1D-LBP is vulnerable to noise and the representation of information is not deep enough. To solve this problem, a bearing fault feature extraction method has been proposed, which combines envelope-cross-correlation and improved 1D-LBP. Firstly, the cross-correlation function of envelope signal of vibration signals detected by two sensors is calculated to blend signals; this solves the problem of incomplete fault information contained a single sensor while reducing the noise and highlighting fault features. Secondly, before quantization of the signal, the feature rule for vibration signals in bearing faults is considered and the local skewness (in place of local central values) of data in the window is taken as a criterion for quantization and the study of improved 1D-LBP is used to solve the problem of incomplete representation of feature information in classical 1D-LBP. Thirdly, through quantization of the cross-correlation function (rather than the original vibration signal) according to the improved 1D-LBP, the problem of inexact quantization of 1D-LBP caused by noise has been solved. Finally, a bearing fault is identified by spectrum analysis of autocorrelation function of reconstructed signals after quantization. Through analysis of bearing vibration signals from different compound faults and the comparison of proposed and other classical methods based on the same data, the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method are verified. © 2025 IOP Publishing Ltd.

"Current signal analysis using SW-GAT networks for fault diagnosis of electromechanical drive systems under extreme data imbalance In complex industrial environments, ensuring the safe operation and effective maintenance of electromechanical equipment is of paramount importance. Intelligent fault diagnosis based on deep learning is currently the most popular data-driven method. However, conventional intelligent fault diagnosis techniques face several challenges: (1) Most diagnostic models rely heavily on analyzing vibration signals. However, vibration sensors are difficult to deploy in space-constrained environments, and vibration signals are frequently contaminated by strong noise. (2) The prevalence of class imbalance between normal and fault data in equipment condition monitoring can lead to model over-reliance on information from a few classes. (3) Traditional diagnostic models presuppose data independence, neglecting the coupling relationships between data. To address the aforementioned issue, this paper proposes a self-weighted graph attention networks based on motor stator current signal analysis, aimed at solving the fault diagnosis problem of critical transmission components in electromechanical systems under severely imbalanced data scenarios. Firstly, the raw current data is preprocessed using stacked autoencoders, and then the decoded current frequency-domain data is utilized to construct graphical data, thereby enhancing the non-common features and weak fault information in the current signals. Secondly, by introducing the graph pooling attention mechanism into GAT, the model can more effectively focus on useful fault feature information within the graph data. Finally, a novel interclass adjustment loss function is designed to adaptively adjust and balance class weights, enabling the model to pay greater attention to minority class samples and thereby improving the recognition accuracy for minority class faults. Validating the proposed method on two cases and comparing it with other advanced approaches, our method achieved the highest accuracy among the compared methods. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd.

"A multi-sensor fault diagnosis method for rotating machinery based on improved fuzzy support fusion and self-normalized spatio-temporal network Recently, the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery based on deep learning has achieved increasingly widespread applications. However, it is often difficult to achieve the expected results by relying on a single sensor due to the limited information obtained by the single sensor and the susceptibility to the influence of the additive noise. To address the above problems, this paper proposes a multi-sensor fusion fault diagnosis method for rotating machinery based on improved fuzzy support fusion and self-normalized spatio-temporal network to enhance feature learning while achieving multi-sensor data fusion. This method includes a data pre-processing module, a fusion module and a fault recognition module. In the first module, a complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise algorithm is introduced to decompose and reconstruct the multi-source sensor signals, thereby reducing the impact of environmental noise on data quality. In the fusion module, a data fusion algorithm based on improved fuzzy support is designed to achieve the data-level fusion of multi-source sensors. By introducing the self-normalized properties into the convolutional structure with bi-directional gated recurrent unit, a self-normalized spatio-temporal network is designed in the fault recognition module to perform the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve high quality data-level fusion and outperforms the state-of-the-art fault diagnosis methods in terms of fault classification. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.",2-s2.0-85169932845
"IoT based solar panel fault and maintenance detection using decision tree with light gradient boosting Solar PV (photovoltaic) technology has advanced greatly in recent years due to advantages such as renewability, environmental friendliness, simple maintenance, and dependability. Nevertheless, a number of PV faults may appear and result in degradation, a decrease in output power, or even a storm surge at different levels, depending on the outside working conditions and regular weather changes that might cause harm to the production, distribution, or setup, it is critical to monitor PVSs (PV systems) for their power generation efficiencies. IoT (Internet of Things) are evolving technologies that have been studied for enhanced fault detection and predictive analysis in the maintenance and environmental monitoring of solar power plants. This research work suggests a method based on MLTs (machine learning techniques) to analyze power data and predict faults for the maintenance of solar power plants. Input data from solar power plants consist of plant power generation and weather data which are first pre-processed and then trained using the suggested DT-LGB (Decision Trees with Light Gradient Boosting) algorithm to predict errors. The trained model was able to identify major/minor faults or anomalies present in input data. Conventionally these identifications require more effort in detection and maintenance. The results of this work showed that the suggested model obtained 8.74 MSEs ((Mean Square Errors), 2.96 RMSEs (Root Mean Square Errors), and R2 values of 0.9939 which is 12.8%, 6.8%, and 11.08% improved than the existing method respectively. © 2023",2-s2.0-85150245027
"A novel deep convolutional neural network and its application to fault diagnosis of the squirrel-cage asynchronous motor under noisy environment The intelligent classification achieved through the utilization of deep learning networks, which possess the capability to automatically extract essential features from data, has garnered significant attention within the domain of fault diagnosis research. Nevertheless, within the industrial production process, the data collected inevitably suffers from noise contamination, thereby adversely affecting the network’s diagnostic results. To enhance the denoising prowess and mitigate the risks associated with overfitting in deep learning networks, this paper introduces the input gate structure of long short-term memory and an attention module into the convolutional neural network to propose a novel architecture known as the gate convolutional attention neural network (gate-CANN), which subsequently finds application in the domain of squirrel-cage asynchronous motor fault diagnosis. Firstly, the sensor-acquired time domain vibration undergo conversion into two-dimensional time-frequency images through the employment of continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Subsequently, the CWT images in two directions are put into gate-CANN for feature extraction, respectively. Finally, feature fusion and fault diagnosis are achieved in the end of network. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, it undergoes verification using the fault diagnosis testbed specific to squirrel cage asynchronous motors. The obtained results demonstrate that, in comparison to alternative diagnostic methods, the proposed approach exhibits superior capabilities in terms of noise resistance and generalization. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd",2-s2.0-85167694343
"Data-driven sensor selection for industrial gearbox fault diagnosis using principal component analysis The failure of gearboxes, a critical component of mechanical power transmission systems, can significantly disrupt process cycle times and decrease production line throughput. Predicting failures in gear transmission systems is notably challenging due to their complex geometry and the interaction of simultaneous faults, which complicates fault isolation. Typically, multiple sensors are deployed at various locations to isolate and analyse faults in gearboxes. However, not all sensor data yield reliable results, making it crucial to select the most effective sensors. This study employs a principal component analysis-based approach to select the best sensor for fault detection. The results show an 18% increase in fault detection accuracy when using the most effective sensor. To validate the proposed approach, experiments were conducted under four gear conditions, considering different speeds, loads, fault severities, and fault types. © 2025 IOP Publishing Ltd.

"Neutralization of temperature effects in damage diagnosis of MDOF systems by combinations of autoencoders and particle filters In the last years, scientific and industrial communities have put a lot of efforts into the development of a new framework for the assessment of structural integrity, generally known as Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), which should allow real-time, automatic evaluations of the state of the structures based on a network of permanently installed sensors. In the context of mechanical, aerospace and civil structures, several approaches have been proposed to address the SHM problem, yet, it remains often difficult to diagnose damages and estimate the structural health when dealing with varying operating and environmental conditions. Particle Filters have already been proposed as a time-domain-based method in the field of SHM, showing promising results as estimators of hidden, not directly observable states, such as those typically related to damages. At the same time, neural networks-based autoencoders have been proposed for structural damage detection, demonstrating to be capable of capturing damage-related features from vibration measurements. This work aims at exploiting the individual advantages offered by the two approaches by combining them in a novel algorithm for structural damage detection and localization, robust with respect to changing environmental conditions. The algorithm is further equipped with a fault indicator module stemming from the introduction of an automatic threshold and both deterministic and probabilistic fault indicators, thus offering a complete, valuable tool for supporting decision making with limited human intervention. The method is demonstrated with reference to a numerical MDOF system whose parameters are taken from a literature benchmark case study. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85107872040
"A novel residual global context shrinkage network based fault diagnosis method for rotating machinery under noisy conditions In real industrial environments, vibration signals generated during the operation of rotating machinery are typically accompanied by significant noise. Existing deep learning methods often yield unsatisfactory diagnostic results when dealing with noisy signals. To address this problem, a novel residual global context shrinkage network (RGNet) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, to fully utilize the useful information in the raw vibration signal, a multi-sensor fusion strategy based on dispersion entropy is designed as the input of the deep network. Then, the RGNet is designed, which improves the long-distance modeling capability of the deep network while suppressing noise, optimizes the network gradient and computational performance. Finally, the noise suppression ability and feature extraction ability of the RGNet are intuitively revealed through an interpretability study.

"Rolling bearing fault diagnosis based on the fusion of sparse filtering and discriminative domain adaptation method under multi-channel data-driven Currently, the diagnostic performance of many deep learning algorithms may drop dramatically when the distribution of training data is significantly different from that of the test data. Moreover, the fault diagnosis approaches based on single-channel data may suffer problems such as large precision fluctuation, low reliability, and incomplete expression of fault features. To overcome the above deficiencies, a novel multi-channel data-driven fault recognition method based on the fusion of sparse filtering (SF) and discriminative domain adaptation (MSFDDA) is proposed in this article. Firstly, inspired by attention mechanisms and information fusion methods, a spectrum-based weighted multi-channel data fusion strategy is designed to fully utilize the data collected by sensors to obtain a more comprehensive representation of fault features. Then, the joint probability-based discriminative maximum mean discrepancy algorithm is introduced into the SF method to strengthen the capability of extracting the domain invariant features. Finally, two bearing datasets are employed to verify the validity of the MSFDDA method, which proved to be superior to other current domain adaptation methods. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd.",2-s2.0-85187621150
"A novel approach for predicting tool remaining useful life using limited data Wear, fracture, and other tool faults affect the quality of a machined workpiece and can even damage machine tools. The accurate prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) can prevent a tool from suddenly failing, an ability of significance for ensuring machining quality and providing effective predictive maintenance strategies. Most current approaches for predicting tool RUL are based on historical failure and truncation data. However, for new types of tools or when a similar tool has just launched, such failure and truncation data are limited or even unavailable, making RUL prediction a challenge when using previously proposed methods. To address this problem, a novel method for the prediction of tool RUL using limited data is proposed in this study. A time window is constructed to track the tool condition using sensor data, and its size can be dynamically adjusted according to the wear factor and increase rate. Then, a deep bidirectional long short-term memory (DBiLSTM) neural network in which sequential data are predicted and smoothed by forwards and backwards directions, respectively, is developed to encode temporal information and identify long-term dependencies. On this basis, multi-step ahead rolling predictions are then employed to predict tool RUL. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified using the results of milling experiments. These results show that the proposed method is able to predict tool RUL with high accuracy using only limited data. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85082388273
"A dual-view network for fault diagnosis in rotating machinery using unbalanced data Data-driven intelligent methods have demonstrated their effectiveness in the area of fault diagnosis. However, most existing studies are based on the assumption that the distributions of normal and faulty samples are balanced during the diagnostic process. This assumption significantly decreases the application range of a diagnostic model as the samples in most real-world scenarios are highly unbalanced. To cope with the limitations caused by unbalanced data, this paper proposed an original dual-view network (DVN). Firstly, an interactive graph modeling strategy is introduced for relationship information modeling of multi-sensor data. Meanwhile, the graph convolution operation is used as the baseline for feature extraction of the constructed interactive graph to mine for fault representations. Secondly, an original dual-view classifier consisting of a binary classifier and a multi-class classifier is proposed, which divides fault diagnosis into two stages. Specifically, in the first stage, the binary classifier performs the binary inference from the view of fault detection. In the second stage, the multi-class classifier performs the full-state inference from the view of fine-grained fault classification. Then, based on the dual-view classifier, a weight activation module is designed to alleviate training bias toward majority classes by sample-level re-weighting. Finally, the diagnosis results can be obtained according to the output of the multi-class classifier. Fault diagnosis experiments using two different datasets with varying data unbalance ratios were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The superiority of the proposed DVN is verified through comparisons with state-of-the-art methods. The effectiveness of the DVN is further validated through ablation studies with some ablative models.

"Optimizing coupled fault diagnosis in liquid rocket engines via distributed robust multi-model Kalman filter This paper concerns a novel fault diagnosis method for decoupling and diagnosing liquid rocket engine (LRE) system and sensor failures. LRE faults significantly affect the launch reliability. Many traditional methods applied in system-level fault diagnosis of LRE struggled with robustness when dealing with sensor and system coupling faults. The distributed robust multi-model Kalman filter (DRMM-KF) based fault diagnosis method is proposed for the LRE sensor-system concurrent fault diagnosis problem to solve the aforementioned issues. Firstly, improvements are made to the multi-model Kalman filter (MM-KF) method to enhance the robustness of the hypothetical model conditional probability calculation to obtain the robust MM-KF (RMM-KF). Then, based on the RMM-KF and local sensor fault hypothesis models, the local robust MM-KFs (LRMM-KFs) are established to describe the local sensor faults of the LRE subsystems, and then, the DRMM-KFs are established by integrating each LRMM-KF to realize the adaptive description of the LRE sensor faults. Finally, by fusing the results of the LRMM-KFs, the index fusion weighted sum-squared residual (FWSSR) is established for LRE system and sensor faults decoupling and diagnosis. After that, three hot-test cases are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in practice. The contribution of this study is to propose the novel DRMM-KF algorithm to achieve real-time LRE system and sensor faults decoupling fault diagnosis, showing the capacity of distinguishing between system and sensor faults with alarm timely. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd.

"Application of wavelet dynamic joint adaptive network guided by pseudo-label alignment mechanism in gearbox fault diagnosis In practical scenarios, gearbox fault diagnosis faces the challenge of extremely scarce labeled data. Additionally, variations in operating conditions and differences in sensor installations exacerbate data distribution shifts, significantly increasing the difficulty of fault diagnosis. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a wavelet dynamic joint self-adaptive network guided by a pseudo-label alignment mechanism (MDJSN-DFL). First, the wavelet-efficient convolution module is designed based on wavelet convolution and efficient attention mechanisms. This module is used to construct a multi-wavelet convolution feature extractor to extract critical fault features at multiple levels. Secondly, to improve the classifier’s discriminability in the target domain, a transitional clustering-guided DFL is developed. This mechanism can capture fuzzy classification samples and improve the pseudo-label quality of the target domain. Finally, a dynamic joint mean square difference algorithm (DJSD) is proposed, which is composed of joint maximum mean square discrepancy and joint maximum mean discrepancy. The algorithm can adaptively adjust according to the dynamic balance factor to minimize the domain distribution discrepancy. Experiments on two different gearbox datasets show that MDJSN-DFL performs better in diagnostic scenarios under varying load conditions and different sensor installation setups, validating the proposed method’s effectiveness and superiority. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd.",2-s2.0-85205681525
"Parallel processing of sensor signals using deep learning method for aero-engine remaining useful life prediction Accurately predicting the remaining useful life of aerospace engines is crucial for enhancing the reliability of aviation equipment. While some methods have taken note of the challenges posed by vast sensor data and complex signal interrelationships, there is still room for improvement in performance. This paper proposes a novel deep learning model that utilizes a parallel structure to independently process inputs from various sensor signals. Each branch in this parallel structure employs a combination of an improved Inception module and a novel feature filtering module as a feature extractor. The improved Inception module boasts a larger perceptual field to ensure the integrity of feature information. The feature filtering module calculates the importance weights of feature information through convenient computation, allowing the network to focus more on feature information without significantly increasing computational complexity. Finally, the feature extractor is combined with a gated recurrent unit module to learn features from sensor signals. Extensive experiments were conducted on the C-MAPSS standard dataset, comparing the proposed method with other state-of-the-art methods. Ablation experiments were performed on the new generation N-CMAPSS standard dataset.

"Data-driven fault detection of a 10 MW floating offshore wind turbine benchmark using kernel canonical variate analysis Floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs) can harvest more wind energy in deep water. However, due to their complex mechanical structure and harsh working conditions, various sensors, actuators, and components of FOWTs can malfunction and fail. To avoid serious accidents and reduce operation and maintenance costs, fault detection plays a critical role in wind-energy engineering, particularly for offshore wind energy. Because of complex characteristics, such as dynamics and nonlinearity, an accurate mathematical model cannot be easily obtained from first principles for FOWTs. In this paper, a new data-driven fault-detection method based on kernel canonical variable analysis (KCVA) is proposed for FOWTs. In the proposed method, the collected measurements are first augmented into time-lagged variables to capture the dynamics of FOWTs. The time-lagged variables are then mapped to a high-dimensional feature space to extract nonlinear features. Specifically, canonical variable analysis (CVA) is carried out to explore the correlations in high-dimensional feature space. For fault detection, two monitoring indexes including T 2 and squared prediction error ( S P E ) statistics are established. To verify the performance of the proposed KCVA-based fault-detection method, experiments on a high-fidelity FOWT benchmark, which was created from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures, and Turbulence v8.0 simulator, were carried out. The results show the capability and efficiency of the proposed KCVA-based fault-detection method in comparison with other related methods. © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.",2-s2.0-85143703520
"Multi-input parallel graph neural network for semi-supervised rolling bearing fault diagnosis Rolling bearing fault diagnosis is the key technology to ensure the reliable, efficient and sustainable operation of rotating machinery. Many fault diagnosis methods have been proposed based on vibration signal analysis from the perspective of data-driven analytics. However, these methods normally take signals of multiple sensors as a whole for feature extraction without considering the relationship among samples. This drawback leads to insufficient feature mining, thereby affecting the accuracy of fault diagnosis. Moreover, these methods need large numbers of labeled samples to achieve high diagnosis accuracy, which requires extensive human labor and is impractical in many real-world applications. To address these issues, a semi-supervised rolling bearing fault diagnosis method based on multi-input parallel graph neural network is proposed in this paper. In the proposed model, signals of multiple sensors are treated separately; thus, features will be extracted parallelly in a more sufficient way. Then, signals of each sensor are constructed into a graph based on limited-radius nearest neighbor, which will add extra relationship information to aid in fault diagnosis. In addition, with the implementation of graph convolutional neural network, the proposed method is able to achieve a more accurate diagnosis than the comparison methods in the case of few labeled data. Finally, the proposed model is evaluated on rolling bearing dataset provided by Case Western Reserve University. Compared with some classical fault diagnosis methods, the proposed model can improve the diagnosis accuracy up to more than 99% even when the proportion of training samples is only 20%. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.",2-s2.0-85148675874
"A smart sensor-based monitoring system for vibration measurement and bearing fault detection Rolling element bearings are commonly used in rotary mechanical and electrical equipment.

The OS-ELM algorithm employs historical sensor data to train and update the engine baseline model. MFAC dynamically establishes a linear model based on the pseudo-gradient change of control variables from the current sensor data and designs a baseline model tracker to calculate reasonable diagnostic thresholds based on historical sensor data characteristics, thereby improving the efficiency of threshold calculation and diagnostic accuracy.

"Robust fault recognition and correction scheme for induction motors using an effective IoT with deep learning approach Maintaining electrical machines in good working order and increasing their life expectancy is one of the main challenges. Precocious and accurate detection of faults is crucial to this process. Induction motors (IMs) are among these machines widely utilized in various fields including industrial and domestic applications that require effective detection of their status.

"Transferable intervalization and midpoint de-mixing interval independent component analysis for industrial fault detection under data uncertainty Due to noise disturbance, sensor drift, and some circumstance factors, process data are unavoidably contaminated with uncertainty, which may destroy the correlation structure of original data and make traditional process monitoring methods perform poorly. In this study, a transferable Gaussian mixture learning (TGML) method is developed to make full use of the important knowledge extracted from source domains to guide and improve the intervalization process of target domain with limited data. Then, a midpoint de-mixing interval independent component analysis (MDM-I2CA) is proposed for non-Gaussian processes with uncertainty. First, MDM-I2CA expands the traditional centering and whitening methods into interval domain to concentrate the data information on higher-order statistics. Second, a midpoint coding strategy is developed to depict the process information with the idea of focusing on the variation between intervals of a dataset, and the statistically interval independent components are further de-mixed. Finally, four monitoring statistics are constructed for fault detection. Extensive experiments show that compared to seven existing algorithms, the developed MDM-I2CA method averagely reduces MDR by 9.58% with average FAR as low as 2.33% in a numerical case, and reduces MDR by 13.60% with FAR no more than 4.00% in a distillation column process. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85196492198
"Global attention mechanism based deep learning for remaining useful life prediction of aero-engine Aero-engine is one of the core components of aircraft. The accurate prediction of areo-engine Remaining Useful Life (RUL) is of great significance for ensuring the operation safety of aircraft. The emergence of attention mechanisms allows the deep learning model to effectively focus on important data features for RUL prediction tasks, which can improve the accuracy of RUL prediction for aero-engine. However, most mainstream dual attention mechanisms currently calculate attention weights for different dimensions separately, making it difficult to obtain global information. A novel global attention (GA) mechanism has been proposed in this paper that overcomes existing challenges and effectively identifies relevant data features for accurate RUL predictions. The structure design of GA adopts a very novel idea, requiring no internal recurrent neural network (RNN) or convolutional neural network (CNN) modules. Instead, it utilizes two pooling operations to extract features from different sensors and time steps, which are then calculated in parallel to obtain global attention coefficients. This enables the deep learning based model to adaptively learn the most important information of the input. Moreover, the parallel computation design avoids wastage of computational resources. On this basis, we combine GA with self-attention (SA) mechanism and temporal convolutional network (TCN) to propose an end-to-end deep learning RUL prediction method. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the C-MAPSS aero-engine dataset is used.

First, MLPC-CNN introduces the single-sensor-to-single-channel (STSSC) convolution to comprehensively extract features from multi-sensor data grayscale image that integrates all sensor information. This design can adopt more targeted filtering strategies for the samples from different sensors, and avoid the risk of extracting conflicting evidence. Second, MLPC-CNN uses a bypass branch structure based on average pooling layer. This design fuses different levels of signal features extracted by different layers without increasing the network learning parameters, which can extract high-level features while retaining more information from low-dimensional features. Third, MLPC-CNN introduces a multi-layer pooling classifier to replace the fully connected layer in traditional CNN.

"Location and corrosion detection of tower grounding conductors based on electromagnetic measurement Tower grounding conductors are buried underground and serve as the grounded discharge channel for the fault or lightning current of a transmission power system. The performance of the grounding conductor is crucial for the safe and reliable operation of transmission power systems.

"Dynamic validation of safety integrity level for safety instrumented system considering random/fuzzy uncertainty This study proposes a dynamic safety integrity level (SIL) validation framework integrating stochastic and fuzzy uncertainty theories to overcome the limitations of conventional static methods. By combining long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for stochastic failure rate prediction and fuzzy support degree (FSD) algorithms for subjective parameter fusion, the methodology enables real-time SIL updates and quantifies parameter impacts through random forest-based feature importance analysis. Two industrial case studies validate the framework's efficacy: For the n-hexane buffer tank level high-high interlock SIS (Case 1), the total probability of failure on demand (PFDavg) increased by 1.71× to 2.48 × 10−3 over three years, with the actuator subsystem exhibiting the fastest-growing PFDavg (2.78×) and a low safe failure fraction (SFF = 0.4589). In the acrylic purification tank outlet flow low interlock SIS (Case 2), the PFDavg of the sensor subsystem sharply increased by a factor of 3.31 over a 33-month period, and the SFF dropped to 0.1927. The framework classifies 33 types of parameters into stochastic, fuzzy, and constant types, achieving 18–25 % higher accuracy than single-uncertainty methods. Dynamic monthly updates reveal critical trends, such as solenoid valve λSU rising to 2.44 × 10−8 (Case 1) and valve λSD3 contributing 76.3 % to PFDavg growth (Case 2). Feature importance analysis prioritizes high-impact parameters (e.g., λDU6 in Case 1; λSD3 in Case 2), guiding targeted maintenance. Both cases confirm SIL compliance, with actuator subsystems identified as reliability bottlenecks. This framework bridges static validation and operational dynamics, offering actionable insights for predictive maintenance and industrial safety intelligence. © 2025",2-s2.0-105004737052
"Sparse representation of complex steerable pyramid for machine fault diagnosis by using non-contact video motion to replace conventional accelerometers Structural health monitoring is vital for ensuring structural safety, avoiding property damage. Contact-type vibration measurement devices, such as accelerometers that provide high-spatial-resolution sensing capacity, cannot be installed on the inspected objects if their surface is hot or inaccessible. In contrast, non-contact-type vibration measurement devices, such as laser vibrometers, are relatively expensive and perform measurements sequentially, which could be time- and labor-intensive when the inspected areas are large. Recently, an alternative non-contact method has been proposed to measure vibration using a high-speed digital-video camera. Due to the continuous advancement in technology, these high-speed cameras are relatively low-cost and have simultaneous measurement capacity with high spatial resolution. To convert the video images captured by the camera to vibration displacement, the key is to use appropriate video signal processing method. For this purpose, phase-based analysis is often used. However, this analysis is time-consuming. Therefore, this paper presents a new processing method by combining the multiple-scale pyramid decomposition method and sparse representation technique. This method can considerably reduce the number of redundant steerable filters, improve the computation efficiency of phase-based video processing and replace the conventional mounted sensors. The experiments indicate that the results obtained by the proposed method for machine shaft fault diagnosis are comparable to those obtained using a physically mounted accelerometer. Hence, the proposed method provides a workable solution to detect abnormal vibrations generated by a structure/machine, with the advantages of no contact and low cost. In the future, this method could be used, for example, to measure the heart and breathing rates of elderly persons without a sensor placed on the body during sleeping. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85100623351
"A class alignment method based on graph convolution neural network for bearing fault diagnosis in presence of missing data and changing working conditions Bearing fault diagnosis in real-world applications has challenges such as insufficient labeled data, changing working conditions of the rotary machinery, and missing data due to multi-rate sampling of sensors. Despite the numerous applications of conventional deep learning (DL) and domain adaptation methods in bearing fault diagnosis, these methods face challenges. Domain adaptation techniques neglect alignment across subdomains with the same class, and DL techniques do not consider data relationships and interdependencies. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces a novel semi-supervised method based on ARMA graph convolution, adversarial adaptation, and multi-layer multi-kernel local maximum mean discrepancy (MK-LMMD). Structural information of data is extracted using ARMA graph convolution, adversarial adaptation is employed to decrease structural distribution discrepancy in the domains, and MK-LMMD is used to align the classes. Additionally, ARMA graph convolution and MK-LMMD can aid in reducing distribution discrepancy caused by missing data and changing working conditions. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85133216620
"Reciprocating compressors intelligent fault diagnosis under multiple operating conditions based on adaptive variable scale morphological filter Faults of reciprocating compressors (RCs) are almost observed as impacts in the vibration signal. Thus, extracting impact features is considered an effective method to monitor RC health conditions and reduce sensor investment. However, the quantity and location of impacts are challenging to identify because of the severe background noise and the broad aliasing frequency. This study proposes a fault knowledge-independent adaptive variable scale morphological filter (AVSMF) and an automatic impact localization method to extract impact features from a vibration signal, making real-time intelligent fault diagnosis possible. The AVSMF method exploits the amplitude distribution of intrinsic mode functions and morphological filters to extract the impact components in a signal. Then, to identify impacts, the demodulation energy operator of symmetrical differencing is utilized to discover instantaneous energy changes. Furthermore, a new feature called the impact phase bin (IPB), which assembles the characteristics of impacts in the form of bins, is presented to improve the fault diagnosis performance. Simulations were carried out on a signal comprising multiple impulses with different frequencies and amplitudes. The results showed the effectiveness of the proposed methods on impact localization. Additionally, the potential application in liquid slugging fault diagnosis was demonstrated. Finally, the superiority of the proposed methods was experimentally substantiated by conducting fault diagnosis tests under single and multiple operating conditions on a two-stage double-acting RC. The fault classification accuracy under the single operating condition is 95.08% using the IPB feature only, and that is 99.06% under multiple operating conditions combining conventional statistical features with the IPB feature. © 2023",2-s2.0-85178332906
"Non-destructive diagnosis of grounding grids based on the electromagnetic induction impedance method When attempting to detect faults in grounding grids, the electromagnetic induction method is hampered by the failure of fault diagnosis based on magnetic flux density detection. An electromagnetic induction impedance method is proposed to diagnose corrosion faults by detecting the induced impedance. A non-destructive testing prototype was developed. The sensor of the prototype consists of biaxial sensing coils, a frequency selection module, and a dual-channel synchronous demodulator. The biaxial sensing coils are configured as four identical coils forming a cross. This symmetrical structure realizes the detection of unknown topological structures in grounding grids. The frequency selection module improves the signal-to-noise ratio of the system. The digital demodulator synchronously extracts the phase information in two orthogonal directions. The key technical indicators of the prototype, such as the frequency characteristics, the amplitude accuracy, the phase accuracy, the interference resistance, and the amplitude consistency between channels are tested. Experiments were carried out on a real-size physical model, corroded samples, and an actual operating substation. The results confirm the feasibility of the method and the prototype for the detection of topological structures, disconnections, and faults in grounding grids. © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.",2-s2.0-85111115074
"Partial discharge ultrasonic signals pattern recognition in transformer using BSO-SVM based on microfiber coupler sensor Detection and pattern recognition of different types of partial discharge (PD) signals in transformer are of great significance for the safe and stable operation of transformers. This paper demonstrates the application of microfiber coupler sensor (MFCS) to the pattern recognition of PD ultrasonic signals with an optimized support vector machine (BSO-SVM) algorithm. First, a PD ultrasonic detection system based on MFCS is built, compared with the traditional piezoelectric sensor, the MFCS can be directly implanted in the transformer oil to detect the PD signals, avoiding the attenuation of ultrasonic signals as they propagate to the transformer outer wall. Then, four kinds of PD ultrasonic signals are collected by the PD detection system, and feature extraction is carried out for the time domain and frequency domain characteristics of PD ultrasonic signals. Finally, a BSO-SVM classification algorithm is proposed, which uses the beetle antennae search (BAS) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to jointly optimize the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The BSO-SVM classifier is used to classify four kinds of PD signals, the classification accuracy is 93%, and the number of convergence is 5. In addition, the BSO-SVM algorithm is compared with the GA-SVM and PSO-SVM algorithms. The results show that the BSO-SVM algorithm has higher recognition accuracy and faster convergence speed.

"A gear fault diagnosis method based on improved accommodative random weighting algorithm and BB-1D-TP As an essential component of a gearbox, gears can damage a structure or even an entire gear transmission system in case of failures. As a result, advanced fault diagnosis methods are crucial to system's operation. Currently, single-signal-driven gear fault diagnosis techniques have been applied in many fields, but multipath noise and single-sensor sampling errors inevitably affected the accuracy of diagnosis. This paper proposes a gear fault diagnosis method based on a novel accommodative random weighting theory and a balanced binary one dimension ternary pattern (BB-1D-TP) model. It can accurately diagnose the types of gear failures under the circumstances of multiple channels and strong background noise. The novel accommodative random weighting algorithm reduces the total mean-square error (MSE) by adaptively adjusting the proportional connection between a measured value at a present state and a historical state. Then the balanced binary algorithm extracts texture features of fault signals for signal enhancement. In the end, the classification is done by using Support Vector Machine (SVM) method. The result of experiments demonstrated that the method in this article effectively improves accuracy and efficiency of gear fault identification. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85130190038
"Research on a fault diagnosis method for rolling bearing based on improved multiscale range entropy and hierarchical prototype A novel fault diagnosis method based on improved multiscale range entropy and hierarchical prototype (HP) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, considering that range entropy cannot analyze the complexity of time series from multiple perspectives, the coarse-grained process is combined with range entropy. In addition, to make the coarse-grained process more comprehensive, the selection of its starting point is improved. Secondly, to extract more feature information, the dimension reduction of eigenvectors is carried out by using singular value decomposition. Finally, HP is trained with the eigenvectors and its performance is tested.

"CTNet: Improving the non-stationary predictive ability of remaining useful life of aero-engine under multiple time-varying operating conditions Remaining useful life (RUL) estimation has been widely studied in prognostics and health management. Multiple time-varying operating conditions explicitly influence the measured performance parameters of the aero-engine, which results in non-stationarity and impedes the predictive ability of deep learning models. Previous data-driven studies primarily ignore the causality between operating condition descriptors and measured performance parameters, which is inconsistent with practical aero-engine engineering applications. To address this issue, we propose a causality Transformer network (CTNet), which improves the prediction stability of non-stationary series under multiple operating conditions. First, a novel graph structure is used to capture the connectivity relationship between operating condition descriptors and measured sensor nodes. Then the causality attention is proposed to inject additional causality information into the self-attention module without affecting the similarity computations of query and key values within the window. The causality attention can generate distinguishable attention for operating conditions, which properly release the predictive potential for non-stationary series. Extensive experiments are performed on public datasets (CMAPSS, N-CMAPSS), showing that CTNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. We have also conducted experiments on the real-world quick access recorder (QAR) data, which validates the performance of the proposed model in perceiving time-varying operating conditions. © 2024",2-s2.0-85211071211
"Vibration displacement measurement method based on vision Gaussian fitting and edge optimisation for rotating shafts The vibrations of rotating machinery contain crucial information for monitoring the operational status of machines and diagnosing potential faults. Measuring vibration displacement using machine vision is currently a promising approach for machine monitoring in industries. However, the existing vision-based vibration displacement measurement methods cannot satisfy the high-accuracy requirements for detecting micrometre-level displacements generated by low-amplitude vibrations of rotating machinery. Therefore, this study proposes an improved noncontact-type vibration displacement measurement method based on Gaussian fitting and edge optimisation for rotating shafts. The real number-type edge positions of the rotating shafts within the selected region of interest (ROI) are accurately extracted via Gaussian edge fitting. Subsequently, edge-linking schemes, double-threshold detection and edge fitting are preformed to optimise the real number-type position of the edges. Finally, continuous displacement extraction of rotating shafts is achieved by monitoring the edge positions in the ROI. The coefficient of determination is used to evaluate a series of simulated and actual experiments quantitatively. The experimental results verify the feasibility, effectiveness, and robustness of the proposed method. An eddy current sensor is used in the actual experiments to verify the accuracy of the proposed method. The result shows that the coefficient of determination reaches 0.9792 when the amplitude of the measured displacement signals is only 22.7 μm. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85190236510
"A spatiotemporal feature learning-based RUL estimation method for predictive maintenance Studies that apply deep learning (DL) methods to maintenance support systems have achieved many successes because degradation patterns and remaining useful life (RUL) of critical equipment can be described and predicted by DL techniques. However, mining spatial and temporal dependencies from multivariate sensor signals and fusing spatiotemporal features sufficiently are challenging tasks. In this proposal, a novel signal-level DL framework containing three layers called STRUL is proposed for end-to-end RUL estimation. The first data segmentation layer is designed based on the sliding window manner which makes STRUL work directly on raw signals. Then, in the information extraction layer, two feature extractors based on the convolutional neural network are used synchronously to learn spatial and temporal features from each time series. The last information aggregation layer is designed to fuse features so that the holistic spatiotemporal features can be learned and further contribute to RUL prediction. The proposed STRUL model achieves better comprehensive performance on RUL estimation tasks than existing models, which has been verified by two case studies. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85151691265

"Fault diagnosis of marine electric thruster bearing based on fusing multi-sensor deep learning models The data-driven fault diagnosis of bearings is important in the marine electric thruster. For avoiding information loss when manually extracting features and unreliable diagnosis by a single sensor, a novel method of fusing multi-sensor deep learning models is proposed. The improved one-dimensional convolution network (1DCNN) can adaptively extract features from single-sensor signals and use them for preliminary fault diagnosis at first.

"A deep residual shrinkage network based on multi-scale attention module for subsea Christmas tree valve leakage detection Recently, the valve leakage detection of subsea Christmas tree (SCT) attracts considerable attention in the field of underwater resource exploitation. However, most existing leakage detection methods rely on contact-sensors, which are expensive and troublesome to install and maintain.

"Quaternion empirical wavelet transform and its applications in rolling bearing fault diagnosis In view of the fact that it is difficult to predict the location and size of the failure of rotating machinery, the sensors sometimes cannot collect the fault information. When the fault location differs from the sensor direction by 180°, the fault information in the signal is weak and may be masked by noise. Multi-channel signal acquisition is one of the methods to solve the problem. Although existing algorithms can extract fault information from a single-channel signal, they are inefficient and sometimes fail to extract weak fault information. Therefore, the information in each channel needs to be associated and combined in advance. This paper proposes a multi-channel signal processing method called quaternion empirical wavelet transform (QEWT). QEWT based on the quaternion Fourier transform can process multiple groups of vibration signals at the same time, which realizes synchronous spectral division, fusion and modal decomposition. The modal separation method based on spectral trend avoids the problems of modal aliasing and low efficiency of scale-space representation. The proposed method combines spectral negentropy with the identification of the fault characteristics of the outer ring and the inner ring, and successfully realizes the fault diagnosis of the rolling bearing. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85128284508
"An improved multi-channel graph convolutional network and its applications for rotating machinery diagnosis Different from most of deep learning-based rotating machinery diagnosis methods, graph convolutional network-based method can effectively mine relationship between nodes in the graph by feature aggregation and transformation. But the performance is limited to graph quality. Currently, edge connections of the graph are often established by calculating the feature similarity of single sensor data.

"A novel remaining useful life prediction method based on gated attention mechanism capsule neural network High-accuracy remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is helpful to make in-time maintenance scheduling, reduce the waste of resources, and prevent the occurrence of serious accidents. Currently, data-driven RUL prediction methods are widely used in engineering fields due to their simplicity, efficiency, and robustness. In data-driven methods, the RUL is predicted by learning the mapping from the sensor data to the RUL of machinery. However, the sensor data are often disturbed by noises, and the existence of noise can negatively affect the follow-up RUL prediction. Moreover, the uncertainty of the predicted RUL is often ignored. To address the issues, this paper proposes a novel gated attention mechanism capsule neural network (GAM-CapsNet). A gated attention mechanism (GAM) is developed to increase the anti-interference ability of the model against noises and assign large weights to the most important features. In order to improve the feature extraction ability of the model and quantify the uncertainty of the RUL prediction, the primary capsule, digital capsule, and Bayesian layer are implemented in the proposed GAM-CapsNet. The effectiveness and superiority of the GAM-CapsNet model are verified on turbine engine and cutter wear datasets. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, the prediction ability of the GAM-CapsNet on four engine datasets is improved by 1.11%, 13.44%, 3.06%, and 12.49%, respectively. In addition, the prediction ability of the GAM-CapsNet on three cutter wear datasets is improved by 33.82%, 58.95%, and 36.33%, respectively.

"Data-driven sensor fault diagnosis for vibration-based structural health monitoring under ambient excitation In vibration-based structural health monitoring (SHM), the early detection of sensor faults is key to preventing false alarms and misleading conclusions on the condition of monitored structures. Since sensor networks are exposed to hostile environments, they are prone to unexpected errors that might influence the quality of measured data. This paper proposes a novel method for detecting and isolating faulty sensors from vibration response data by establishing an overdetermined system between the measured signals and the actual motion. The method assumes a rigid body motion of the monitored system, describable by a limited number of degrees of freedom (DOFs), to define the overdetermined relation between the sensor outputs and the system's DOFs. The concept is later extended to systems not governed by rigid body motions by considering their vibration mode shapes. The robustness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated using vibration response data from an experimental monitoring campaign. © 2024 The Author(s)",2-s2.0-85198234612
"Study on pre-damage diagnosis and analysis of adhesively bonded smart PZT sensors using EMI technique The electro-mechanical impedance technique (EMI) is one of the best methods for continuous structural health monitoring (SHM) by embedding a smart piezoelectric ceramic Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) sensor or pasting it over the surface of the structure. The smart PZT transducer is intensely affected by the adhesive bonding condition between the PZT patch and the host structure. The current paper studies the damage-diagnosis process of the coupled electro-mechanical behavior of an adhesively bonded smart PZT transducer. The inverse of impedance signatures is used for investigating pre-damage diagnosis and analysis of surface-mounted PZT transducer. A parametric study on the variation of adhesive property is carried out to overcome the shear lag effect. The novel contribution of this paper discusses a methodology for an early diagnosis of damage in the PZT transducer and adhesive bond layer during the SHM process. Firstly, the damage is introduced to the PZT patch and bonding layer, and the corresponding EMI signatures are obtained using numerical modeling and simulations. The damage detection using susceptance is discussed for lower frequencies from 0 to 20 kHz. It is observed that the change in susceptance signature is not large enough to detect adhesive debonding. Subsequently, the conductance signatures are utilized for the investigation. It is observed that damage in the adhesive layer and PZT patch cause upward or downward shift with no alteration along the horizontal direction. It helps to detect sensor breakage and adhesive debonding effectively. Secondly, the simulation results are verified using the theoretical analysis for the single piezo configuration by improved continuum-based impedance equations. A modified dual piezo configuration is investigated to validate the proposed method. Experimental investigation on PZT-bonded aluminum plate involving perfectly bonded, adhesive debonding, and sensor breakage conditions are conducted to verify the process. It is found that the real part of the admittance signature is reliable and critical in sensor diagnosis, and sensor faults of debonding and breakage can be identified and differentiated. It also validates the semi-analytical work results. Therefore, the proposed methodology for pre-diagnosing damage present in the smart PZT sensor and adhesive layer using the EMI technique can be utilized for effective SHM. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85119455890

"Method for fault detection of aluminum oxide grinding wheel cutting surfaces using a piezoelectric diaphragm and digital signal processing techniques A novel strategy to quantify evenness and prevent faults on the cutting surface of conventional aluminum oxide grinding wheels during the dressing operation was proposed in this research work. The method is based on the use of low-cost piezoelectric diaphragms and new signal processing parameters based on time-frequency and ratio of power metric. Dressing tests were performed on two structurally distinct aluminum oxide grinding wheels. An acoustic emission (AE) sensor was used as a reference for comparative purposes. Subsequently, AE and piezoelectric diaphragm signals were collected and processed through the proposed approach. The results obtained for both grinding wheels by the piezoelectric diaphragm reveal a strong correlation with those obtained by the AE sensor.

"Research on image processing-based oil particle contaminant detection methods and devices With the continuous advancement of automation, regular condition monitoring and fault diagnosis are necessary to ensure the long-term operational stability of mechanical equipment. Lubricating oil, often referred to as the “lifeblood” of mechanical equipment, serves various functions such as energy transfer, anti-wear, system lubrication, corrosion prevention, rust prevention, and cooling. Therefore, detecting contaminants in the lubricating oil of mechanical equipment, especially particulate contaminants, is a prerequisite for ensuring the normal operation of the equipment. This paper designs and constructs an oil particle contaminant target detection algorithm based on Faster RCNN-Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), which combines a deep learning model with traditional image processing for extracting information about oil particle contaminants. This algorithm can extract information on oil particle pollutants’ location, type, quantity, size, and shape. On a smaller dataset, the MAP score of Faster RCNN-CLIP is 68.43%, the F1 score is 62.35%, while the corresponding metrics of Faster RCNN are 24.57% and 20.23%, respectively, and YOLOv5 are 40.79% and 31.22%. These results indicate that Faster RCNN-CLIP is a model more suitable for oil particle contaminant detection, especially under limited data resources.An oil particle contaminant detection device was also developed to break free from the laboratory constraints.

"Unscented Kalman-filter-based simultaneous diagnostic scheme for gas-turbine gas path and sensor faults Sensor faults can cause incorrect estimations of gas path fault amplitudes in gas turbines. In this paper, an unscented Kalman-filter (UKF)-based simultaneous diagnostic scheme for gas-turbine gas path and sensor faults is proposed. A fault detection and isolation (FDI) system based on the UKF method avoids the requirement to establish different hypothetical models for hierarchical multiple-model-based FDI. Moreover, a fault identification module based on the weighted sum of squared residuals from a bank of filters is proposed to confirm the actual fault. The corresponding fault amplitude is then estimated to adaptively update the related parameters of the fault-diagnosis system according to the actual determined fault. Finally, several simulation case studies are conducted, based on a three-shaft gas turbine. The simulation results show that when two faults coincide, the proposed scheme not only has diagnostic accuracies of 97.3% and 93% for sensor faults and gas path faults, respectively, but also estimates the fault magnitude to a high degree of accuracy. © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.",2-s2.0-85109080559

Therefore, an attention mechanism based multiscale convolutional neural network prediction model is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is used to transform the one-dimensional vibration signal collected by the sensor into a two-dimensional time–frequency spectral feature map. Secondly, the quadratic degradation function is selected to determine the health indices of the bearings. Thirdly, the multi-scale convolutional neural network (MSCNN) is employed to realize the deep feature extraction. The multi-scale fusion features are constructed by extracting different degradation features of the signal using convolutional kernels of different sizes, and the necessary degradation features extracted are further enhanced and non-essential features are suppressed through a convolutional attention mechanism. Finally, the proposed model is verified on the PRONOSTIA dataset and compared with other prediction methods. The results indicate that the proposed one achieves better performances than other algorithms with the lowest prediction error and the highest prediction score. It is verified that this method can effectively improve the prediction accuracy and generalization performance, which could provide a certain theoretical basis and for RUL prediction of bearings and other equipment. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85137157823
"A novel method for journal bearing degradation evaluation and remaining useful life prediction under different working conditions Accurate bearing degradation performance analysis and remaining useful life (RUL) prediction are significant to prevent major accidents and economic losses in industry. Data-driven methods have emerged as reliable algorithms for RUL prediction. These existing approaches assume that the training (source) and testing (target) samples have the same probability distribution. However, the obtained run-to-failure datasets with different work conditions are usually from different domains. The distribution discrepancy between the source and target domain will reduce the accuracy of RUL prediction models when only source domain data in one working condition is trained. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a novel transfer learning method for journal bearing RUL prediction under different work conditions based on the LSTM-DNN network with domain adaptation. The multi-sensor run-to-failure datasets of journal bearings are collected and the extracted multi-sensor features are used for degradation assessment through the fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm and the determination of degradation occurrence time (DOT). The multi-sensor feature representations and RUL values after DOT are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results show that the proposed method has higher accuracy in journal bearing RUL prediction under different work conditions and outperforms other transfer learning approaches. © 2021",2-s2.0-85102879543
"Fault diagnosis in a hydraulic directional valve using a two-stage multi-sensor information fusion As it is usually operating in bad working conditions and subjected to the severe interference from diverse paths, internal faults of the hydraulic valve are difficult to be detected using conventional hydraulic testing technology (such as relying on pressure sensors or flow sensors). Moreover, the information collected from a single sensor may not provide accurate diagnostic evidence or a complete description on faults of hydraulic valves, even though employing intelligent fault diagnosis methods. Therefore, a two-stage multi-sensor information fusion method is proposed, including the fault feature fusion and the decision-making information fusion. The aim is to realize the diagnosis on internal faults of hydraulic directional valves using the vibration signal analysis method instead of conventional hydraulic testing ones. The method is mainly divided into three steps. First, the noise reduction of the vibration information collected by multiple acceleration sensors is done using ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and Teager-Kaiser energy operator (TEO), so that fault features are more obvious. Then, multi-class fault features including the severity and the location of the wear are extracted from the preprocessing signals to form the original feature set. Second, combined with feature ranking and subset selection based on euclidean distance (FRSSED) and maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) feature selection method, the statistical features extracted from multiple sensor signals are optimized to form the optimal feature subset. This is the first-level information fusion concerned with fault feature information fusion. In the third step, based on Dempster-Shafer (DS) evidence theory and convolutional neural network (CNN), decision-making information is fused (called second-level information fusion) to obtain the final diagnosis results. A hydraulic test bench is built to test different failure valves. Experimental results indicate that this method is effective in extracting the fault features from multi-sensor signals and detecting the fault states including severity and location of internal wear of the hydraulic valve. © 2021",2-s2.0-85105692757
"Investigations on interpretable nuclear-grade hydraulic damper monitoring and diagnosis from multi-source high-dimensional profile data Condition monitoring and fault diagnosis is important to ensure smooth machine operation, in which the use of multi-source high-dimensional profile data composed of multiple physical signals collected by multiple sensors for machine health monitoring and fault diagnosis has not been fully explored. In this paper, interpretable monitoring and diagnostic methods are proposed to analyze multi-source high-dimensional profile data and identify equipment operational status. Firstly, polynomials of segmenting profiles as well as a Lasso model are established to obtain sparse features. Then, for offline data with historical fault labels, an optimal linear hyperplane classifier is constructed to interpretably study the impact of different features on a decision. For online data with only normal samples, constructing an optimal hypersphere enables the measurement of operational status. Large-scale nuclear-grade hydraulic damper profile data are used to demonstrate how the proposed interpretable models work and show their physical interpretation for monitoring and fault diagnosis. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85198499058
"A time-varying contact dynamic modeling method of kinematic pairs based on digital twin In mechanical systems, the contact force and friction between components of kinematic pairs are influenced by dynamic factors such as external random excitation, wear on contact surfaces, manufacturing errors, etc., resulting in significant uncertainties and time-varying characteristics. Existing contact dynamic modeling methods of kinematic pairs mainly focus on the theoretical universality of the models, and the aforementioned uncertainties and time-varying characteristics have not yet received sufficient attention. Digital twin, a crucial enabler of information-physical integration, provide a new way to solve this problem. This paper analyzes the connotation of dynamic modeling of mechanical systems based on digital twin. A framework for digital twin-based time-varying contact dynamic modeling of kinematic pairs by integrating sensor data is proposed. The implementation of this framework is explored through theoretical model construction, dynamic data acquisition, feature extraction, and information-physical integration. Using gear transmission as a case study, the paper demonstrates the application of the proposed framework to digital twin-based time-varying dynamic modeling and validates its effectiveness.

"Fault detection method for energy measurement systems equipped with a Rogowski coil using the coil's response to a unit voltage jump and a fully convolutional neural network The article presents a method of assessing the condition of a measurement system equipped with a Rogowski coil using the response of the coil to the unit voltage jump in the secondary circuit. The method is based on a direct sensor-microcontroller interface and has been tested on the STM32F745 microcontroller. Unlike traditional direct sensor-microcontroller methods described in literature a Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCN) is used to extract signal features and estimate the state of the system. The microcontroller is responsible for capturing the coil responses, which are used by the FCN for time series classification. This method allows creating smart sensor with self-testing and identification capabilities. The Class Activation Map (CAM) is used to define class specific contribution regions and verify the performance of the FCN network. The proposed framework is suitable for remote assessment of the system condition in high voltage areas where Rogowski coils are used. Because of the presence of voltages dangerous for humans and the frequent inability to switch off the voltage in a power facility, this method significantly speeds up the location of damage in the measurement system. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85123703028
"Fault detection and diagnosis in electric motors using 1d convolutional neural networks with multi-channel vibration signals Fault detection and diagnosis in time series data are becoming mainstream in most industrial applications since the increase of monitoring sensors in machinery. Traditional methods generally require pre-processing techniques before training; however, this task becomes very time-consuming with multiple sensors. Recently, deep learning methods have shown great results on time series data. This paper proposes a multi-head 1D Convolution Neural Network (1D CNN) to detect and diagnose six different types of faults in an electric motor using two accelerometers measuring in two different directions. This architecture was chosen due to each head can deal with each sensor individually, increasing feature extraction. The proposed method is verified through a series of experiments with seven different induced faults and operation conditions. The results show that the proposed architecture is very accurate for multi-sensor fault detection using vibration time series. Since the experiments are based on real electric motors and faults, these results are promising in real applications. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85123605285
"A new raw signal fusion method using reweighted VMD for early crack fault diagnosis at spline tooth of clutch friction disc Spline tooth root crack is a kind of critical faults for clutch friction disc. Most traditional crack diagnosis methods based on single-sensor or fusion may be degraded due to incomplete fault information or low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Aiming at enhancing the ratio of fault-related information in the fusion signal, a new reweighted variational mode decomposition (VMD) multi-point fusion method is proposed. With the proposed method, each measurement point vibration acceleration signal is decomposed by VMD firstly, and the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) containing different sensitivities information are obtained. Then, correlation energy fluctuation (CEF) and confidence distance are utilized to evaluate the IMFs and raw signal respectively. A new dual-weight strategy is proposed to restructure the IMFs. Finally, convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to identify spline tooth early crack faults. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has greater fault recognition rate than single point and other fusion methods. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85167455731
"Enhanced feature extraction method for motor fault diagnosis using low-quality vibration data from wireless sensor networks Wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which are usually powered by batteries, have been extensively used in condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of motors. To extend the battery service life, the length of the acquired and transmitted signal should be short and the sampling resolution should be reduced. In this case, the motor signal quality is low, which affects the fault diagnosis accuracy. To address this issue, this study proposes an enhanced feature extraction method for motor fault diagnosis using low-quality vibration signals acquired from a battery-powered WSN node. First, the vibration signal is converted to an image using a wavelet synchrosqueezed transform technique. Second, the constructed image is enhanced using a histogram equalization. Finally, the enhanced image is inputted into a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, and the motor fault type can be recognized from the CNN output. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method are validated by comparing its performance in the brushless direct motor test rig with the performance of several traditional methods. The relationship between the fault diagnosis accuracy and WSN performances is investigated and discussed. The proposed method shows potential applications for remote motor fault diagnosis using the low-quality vibration signal acquired from a WSN node with limited battery capacity. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.",2-s2.0-85081968150
"MD-BiMamba: An aero-engine inter-shaft bearing fault diagnosis method based on Mamba with modal decomposition and bidirectional features fusion strategy Inter-shaft bearing fault diagnosis can greatly save maintenance costs and guarantee the normal operation of aero-engines. However, existing methods are limited in their ability to handle sensor signals with high dimensional and complex noise. To tackle the above problems, we propose a Mamba network structure with Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) and bidirectional feature fusion for aero-engine inter-shaft bearing fault diagnosis, called MD-BiMamba. Firstly, we utilize the CEEMDAN technique to decompose the sensor signals of inter-shaft bearings and extract the intrinsic modal function by improving the noise addition method and decomposition strategy. Then, bidirectional Mamba is designed to extract the bidirectional long-range correlation of the sequence to achieve global feature extraction and fast detection of fault types with linear complexity. Moreover, an adaptive attention fusion method is proposed to achieve bidirectional feature fusion. Finally, we use the label smoothing regularization strategy to optimize the cross-entropy loss and enhance the generalization performance. Experimental results on real inter-shaft bearing datasets and noisy datasets show that the proposed method achieves 99.88 % and 95.81 % accuracy in the standard dataset and −10 dB noise environment, respectively, which is superior to other remarkable methods, in addition to achieving lower model complexity. © 2024",2-s2.0-85205471095
"Equivalent network modeling of eddy-current transfer functions The use of eddy-current techniques as a measurement method for material characterization instead of simple fault detection requires transformation of the electrical response signals to quantifiable physical parameters that correlate with material properties. Apart from calibration-curve methods, exact approaches that correctly represent all interactions between excitation field and response field are computationally intensive and not well suited to real-time application. In this work, an equivalent circuit network model is constructed and its analytical equation for the voltage transfer function is derived. This model is then implemented in a soft sensor system. Finally, measurement results from various materials with different electromagnetic properties are presented. © 2024 The Author(s)",2-s2.0-85194424558
"A hybrid prognostic method for rotating machinery under time-varying operating conditions by fusing direct and indirect degradation characteristics Condition monitoring technologies can provide sensor data for predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of rotating machinery. However, it is often difficult to obtain direct degradation characteristics (DCs), which directly reflect the health of a machine, in real-time. Instead, indirect DCs, which are collected under time-varying operating conditions, are often used. Traditional machine learning and model-based prognostic methods may not be effective when handling such data. This paper presents a hybrid Direct-Indirect Fusion (DIF) method that combines direct and indirect DCs to predict the RUL of rotating machinery under time-varying conditions. The framework can account for time-varying covariates, convert indirect DCs to direct DCs under moderate sample sizes with a loop-generative adversarial network (Loop-GAN), and describe gradual degradation and sudden shocks in direct DCs with Lévy processes. The proposed framework outperforms several benchmarks in predicting the degradation path and RUL of rotating machinery as demonstrated in both simulation examples and an industrial application. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85152598849
"Bearing fault diagnosis based on vibro-acoustic data fusion and 1D-CNN network Bearing fault diagnosis is an important part of rotating machinery maintenance. Existing diagnosis methods based on single-modal signals not only have unsatisfactory accuracy, but also bear the inherent risk of being misguided by single-modal signal noise. A new method is put forward that fuses multi-modal sensor signals, i.e. the data collected by an accelerometer and a microphone, to realize more accurate and robust bearing-fault diagnosis. The proposed method extracts features from raw vibration signals and acoustic signals, and fuses them using the 1D-CNN-based networks. Extensive experimental results obtained on ten groups of bearings are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. By analyzing the loss function and accuracy rate under different SNRs, it is empirically found that the proposed method achieves higher rate of diagnosis accuracy than the algorithms based on a single-modal sensor. Moreover, a visualization analysis is also conducted to investigate the inner mechanism of the proposed 1D-CNN-based method. © 2020",2-s2.0-85092243418
"Enhancing non-stationary feature learning for remaining useful life prediction of aero-engine under multiple operating conditions Remaining useful life (RUL) estimation has been widely concerned, given its significant role in prognostics and health management of industry systems. This paper focuses on the non-stationarity of real-world aero-engine sensors data under multiple operating conditions. Previous methods accomplish the normalization operation to attenuate the inherent non-stationarity of raw series for better predictability, which can be less instructive for bursty RUL prediction tasks. To tackle the limitations of direct normalization, we propose a difference transformer network (DFormer). First, we present a series decomposition module to extract predictable components from different series, which can meticulously perceive the non-stationary information of each component. Then the difference attention is proposed to approximately obtain attention without normalization to maintain the non-stationarity of the time series. Furthermore, DFormer consists of two complementary parts: the encoder for incorporating the non-stationary information of the original series and the decoder for stable distribution of time series. We have conducted extensive experiments on the CMAPSS and N-CMAPSS datasets. The results show that DFormer can significantly improve prediction performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the non-stationary feature learning performance of the model is validated on QAR engineering data, demonstrating the capability of practical engineering applications. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85185846632
"A visual measurement method of structural body vibration displacement combined with image deblurring The visual vibration displacement measurement task is limited by the acquisition equipment or the acquisition environment, and there are still defects in the recognition rate. In this paper, starting from the aspect of enhancing the feature information of the input image, a visual measurement method for structural body vibration displacement is constructed combining deblurring and image feature enhancement. Aiming at problems such as blurring that may be encountered during image data acquisition, this paper designs a Multi-Scale Structural Body Image Deblurring Network (MSDNet) based on the Encoder–Decoder architecture to enhance the target feature details in the structural body image. MSDNet obtains more detailed feature information of the structural body by aggregating feature information at different scales in the Encoder–Decoder architecture. Meanwhile, this paper uses the super-resolution image reconstruction method in the Decoder stage instead of the upsampling method to better preserve the feature information of the underlying image. To verify the effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper, a variety of structural body vibration displacement image datasets were produced, and the sensor simultaneously collected structural body displacement data as standard data. The follow-up experiments can also be concluded that the image data after deblurring processing can have a better measurement accuracy of structural body vibration displacement. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85148542875
"A pitch angle fault tolerant estimation method of infrared focal plane array based on indeterminate value segmentation − improved Hough transform The current attitude calculation method with an infrared focal plane array (IRFPA) is similar to that with a unit infrared sensor in that it uses time-domain signals composed of pixels. Therefore, a fault tolerant estimation method based on the indeterminate value segmentation − improved Hough transform (IVS-IHT), is proposed for calculating the pitch angle of projectiles based on an IRFPA. After the time-domain signals are mapped into images, a set of indeterminate values is used for image segmentation, and edge detection is carried out. Posterior logic is introduced based on the Hough transform to obtain the slope and the number of data points of edge lines. Maximum likelihood estimation is utilized to obtain the texture gradient to calculate the pitch angle.

Furthermore, the validation experiments indicate that the SPV fault can be clearly distinguished by its noise signal, confirms the effectiveness of proposed approach.

"Multi-sensor signal fusion for a compound fault diagnosis method with strong generalization and noise-tolerant performance The gearbox is one of the main components of rotating machinery, for which the complex and changeable working environment leads to frequent failures. To solve the problems of the low diagnostic accuracy of compound faults, weak generalization ability, and difficult diagnosis in a noisy environment, a new method is proposed based on a convolutional neural network. First, the fusion of vibration signals collected by multiple sensors forms a one-dimensional sequence as the input of the network. Second, the random destruction of input and minimal batch normalization mechanisms are introduced to improve the noise tolerance and generalization ability of the model. Finally, the accuracy is estimated by ten-fold cross-validation, which ensures the reliability of the diagnostic results when there are few fault samples.

"A configuration design method for a redundant inertial navigation system based on diagnosability analysis Redundant design can improve the performance of an inertial navigation system, and the configuration is an important factor in determining the accuracy and reliability of the redundant inertial navigation system. As well as the sensor quantity and the reliability of single sensors, the reliability of the redundant inertial navigation system also depends on the capability of the fault diagnosis, which has been neglected in much of the previous research.

"A dual-mode automatic switching feature points matching algorithm fusing IMU data Feature point extraction and matching work together and play a crucial role in many machine vision tasks, such as visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) which is the basis of robotics. However, feature matching has not been fully studied as much as feature extraction. The most widely used feature matching method is still the classical brute-force matching. In this paper, by fusing the data of inertial measurement unit (IMU), a novel feature points matching algorithm with online learning fault detection, where the global matcher and local matcher operate alternately and switch automatically, is proposed to improve matching accuracy. Taking the uncertainties of the initial states of camera and IMU into account in the initialization phase, the system starts with the global mode to accomplish the matching task and initialize the state variables which are used to align the data of two sensors. Then, once completing the initialization, the algorithm will automatically switch to our new-designed local matcher with feature compensation, which bounds the search space and improves the matching accuracy via performing on the support region according to the results of IMU pre-integration rather than the whole image. In addition, for the purpose of effectively dealing with the misestimation of support region induced by IMU failures, an online learning fault detector based on support vector machines is newly developed, which can trigger the action of mode switcher and runs simultaneously in another thread. Furthermore, a timer is attached to the fault detector in order to activate the detection periodically, which can further reduces the cost of computing resources.

"A strong anti-noise and easily deployable bearing fault diagnosis model based on time–frequency dual-channel Transformer Deep learning is widely used in Bearing Fault Diagnosis (BFD). Nonetheless, practical industrial production often generates a large amount of industrial noise. These noises exhibit randomness and complexity, which puts forward higher requirements for diagnosis algorithms. Certain studies have tackled the issue of anti-interference in high-noise environments (SNR≤0dB) by increasing the complexity of the model. However, due to the excessive number of parameters and computation, such models cannot be deployed on low-end edge devices. Balancing resource consumption and accuracy has become a major challenge in BFD modeling research. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a new Transformer architecture model called LTFAFormer. The LTFAFormer is capable of achieving high-precision diagnostics on low-end edge devices and shows greater noise resistance. In terms of processing sequence information, Transformer has proven to be superior to other solutions. However, when dealing with longer sensor signal data containing complex noise, the traditional self-attention mechanism not only cannot effectively extract fault features, but also generates more computational complexity than CNN. To address this issue, we propose a novel time–frequency dual-channel parallel attention mechanism. Our approach enhances the feature extraction capability of the model by expanding the attention computation scale and reduces the computational resource consumption of the model by optimizing the model structure. To validate the effectiveness of LTFAFormer, we present two cases to demonstrate that LTFAFormer has higher prediction accuracy while satisfying lightweight. Especially in high-noise environments, LTFAFormer has stronger robustness. In this paper provides a new set of feasible strategies for the practical deployment of BFD models in practical industrial environments. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85195393716

This paper proposes a novel fault diagnosis scheme for planetary gearbox using multi-criteria fault feature selection and heterogeneous ensemble learning classification. Vibration signals collected by the acceleration sensors are imported for fault diagnosis of planetary gearbox. High dimension fault features are extracted by analyzing the vibration signals in time domain, frequency domain and time-frequency domain. The criteria for selecting lower dimension optimal fault features of planetary gearbox are designed, and the mathematic model for fault feature selection with multi-criteria is established. After that, a new feature selection method using Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D) is applied to obtain diverse lower dimension quasi optimal fault feature subsets. Then each quasi optimal fault feature subset is transferred to a base classifier for primary fault diagnosis. Those base classifications are performed by support vector machine and sparse Bayesian extreme learning machine respectively. Dezert-Smarandache rules are applied for classifier-level fusion to achieve and evaluate overall accuracy of the fault diagnosis for planetary gearbox. Experimental results state that the proposed method constantly gets diverse lower dimension quasi optimal fault features smoothly, and significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of fault diagnosis. © 2020",2-s2.0-85097072036

"Fault diagnosis of multi-step electromagnetic hydraulic valve group based on localized current signal CS-SVM The current fault diagnosis method for the electromagnetic hydraulic valve group, which is based on the direct fusion of multi-sensor signals for global modeling, has encountered issues such as data redundancy and information drowning. This study proposes a novel multi-step electromagnetic hydraulic valve group fault diagnosis method based on the localized current signal CS-SVM (Cosine Similarity-Support Vector Machine). Firstly, the study analyzed the total current waveform of the electromagnetic hydraulic valve group under different working steps and used the time–frequency mixed signal characteristics of the total current at different working steps as the input of EDTW (Enhanced Dynamic Time Warping) for step matching. Secondly, the features of the transition phase of the same working step were extracted to construct a health index based on CS, and fault detection was achieved through CUSUM (Cumulative Sum). After identifying the system abnormality, the fault mode recognition was carried out through t-SNE-SVM (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding-Support Vector Machine). Finally, a multi-step electromagnetic hydraulic valve group test bench was constructed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results indicate that the proposed method can rapidly and accurately detect system anomalies and identify fault types across various fault conditions, achieving an anomaly detection accuracy of 100% and an average fault diagnosis accuracy of 97.89%, with a diagnostic standard deviation of 3.46%. These findings demonstrate that the proposed method can swiftly and accurately provide early warnings and diagnose faults in multi-step electromagnetic hydraulic valve systems. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85214314943
"An effective fault diagnosis approach for bearing using stacked de-noising auto-encoder with structure adaptive adjustment Fault diagnosis of bearing plays an important role in maintaining the stable operation of rotating equipment. However, the existing approaches are not effective enough in multi-working conditions. Especially, the diagnosis network structure was selected by experience, which is not self-adaptive and smart. In addition, the data collected in the industrial environment contain noise, which would interfere with the diagnosis results. To overcome these concerns, an effective approach based on stacked de-noising auto-encoder (SDAE) with structure adaptive adjustment is proposed for bearing fault diagnosis. In the aspect of fault information acquisition, two vibration sensors are adopted to collect the vibration data of bearing in two directions to enrich the fault information. In the aspect of diagnosis network design, a novel comprehensive loss function of SDAE in the process of reverse fine-tuning is proposed, which makes the network optimization in favor of feature classification. Meanwhile, an adaptive optimization algorithm is designed to adaptively adjust the structure of SDAE, which can avoid the blind selection of network structure by experience.

"Cross model fusion-based fault diagnosis for equipment considering multi-source signal fusion with small samples based on deep transfer learning Fault diagnosis often suffers from small-sample conditions that make deep models prone to over-fitting. To address this issue, we propose a diagnosis framework that combines sensor-level signal fusion, Gramian Angular Field (GAF) imaging, transfer learning, and Siamese Neural Network(SNN). First, the synchronous vibration signals collected from multiple sensors are arithmetically averaged at each time point to generate a unified one-dimensional sequence. This fused sequence is then transformed into a two-dimensional image by GAF encoding, which preserves temporal correlations while implicitly embedding information from all sensors. Two crucial neural networks are designed: the first is a subnetwork constructed based on EfficientNet with wide convolutional layers, and the second is a decision network based on attention mechanisms and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (Bi-GRUs) to extract key features from complex data. The subnetwork is pre-trained on ImageNet to learn effective initial feature representations, which are then transferred to the bearing fault diagnosis task using transfer learning methods. Finally, the Siamese Neural Network framework fuses the subnetwork and decision network, enhancing the model's generalization performance. To validate the effectiveness of the constructed model and improve its generalization to real-world fault diagnosis scenarios, the latest dataset of aircraft engine inter-shaft bearing faults from 2023 is used for training and diagnosis. The final model achieves a 99.6% accuracy, confirming its outstanding performance in practical fault diagnosis.

"Abnormal data detection and recovery of sensors network based on spatiotemporal deep learning methodology This paper proposes a novel deep-learning-enabled framework for abnormal data detection and recovery considering spatial-temporal correlation among sensors. The wavelet scattering transform is adopted to replace the first layer of one-dimension convolutional neural network classification model.

"Completely adaptive projection multivariate local characteristic-scale decomposition and its application to gear fault diagnosis Multichannel signal can be quickly and effectively decomposed using multivariate local characteristic-scale decomposition (MLCD). However, multi-channel signals acquired by sensors often have power imbalance characteristic, and MLCD uses uniform projection to estimate the baseline, which leads to inaccuracy of MLCD in decomposing such signals. Additionally, uniform projection introduces some projection vectors that can't precisely describe the multichannel signal, based on which, completely adaptive projection (CAP) is proposed in this paper. Completely adaptive projection multivariate local characteristic-scale decomposition (CAPMLCD) is developed on the basis of CAP. The simulation and experimental results show that CAPMLCD and MLCD perform better in terms of suppressing mode mixing, decomposition efficiency, and decomposition accuracy than multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) and adaptive projection intrinsically transformed multivariate empirical mode decomposition (APIT-MEMD). By comparing with MEMD, APIT-MEMD and MLCD, CAPMLCD has better decomposition accuracy and lower dependence on the number of projections. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85137048273
"Data reliability and fault diagnostic for air quality monitoring station based on low cost sensors and active redundancy Air pollution is both an environmental and societal issue. Conventional air quality monitoring involves costly measuring stations that demand specialized personnel. A more affordable and accessible alternative approach consists in the use of low-cost sensor networks (LCS). However, LCS have drawbacks such as variable component quality, unreliable measurements, and short lifespan. Previous research has addressed these problems through redundant LCS and expand measurement capabilities. Nevertheless, challenges remain regarding reliability. Specifically, the use of median aggregations tends to hide errors and failures, especially when most sensors are faulty. This paper proposes a new method to make data reliable and generate diagnostic through three indicators: Synthesis, Detection, and Indexes. These indicators enable the prediction of the station's health status, identify faulty sensors, and assess the quality of the Synthesis with a confidence index. This approach ensures consistent data collection despite disturbances and malfunctions in the LCS and can be used for informed decisions and actions to mitigate air pollution. The initial implementation of this approach involves deploying the first station in the Communauté de Communes Pyrénées Vallée des Gaves (CCPVG) territory. The obtained results showed the adaptability of the proposed approach for future LCS implementations and long-term air quality monitoring. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85175693627
"Enhancing machinery reliability in lunar bases: Optimized machine learning for bearing fault classification in DC power distribution networks In space missions and extraterrestrial habitats, ensuring the reliability of power systems is critical, particularly for DC distribution networks supporting lunar bases and space stations. These systems rely on rotating machinery such as motors and pumps, making the integrity of rolling bearings essential. There is a significant gap in robust fault detection and classification for such machinery under harsh, variable conditions similar to those in space. Existing machine learning (ML) methods often struggle to capture complex multi-channel patterns in sensor data due to overfitting, hyperparameter sensitivity, and high computational demands. This study proposes an ML-driven framework for fault classification in rolling bearings under extreme conditions, taking into account varying dataset sizes. Using three datasets, the proposed approach employs multi-variate variational mode decomposition (MVMD) and Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) to capture fault signatures and extract relevant features. To address overfitting and account for monotonic fault progression, this framework fuses four feature selection methods —Laplacian Score (LS), Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR), ReliefF, and Mutual Information (mutInf)—with Spearman's rank correlation. The performance of ML classifiers (Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Ensemble Methods) is optimized by adjusting hyperparameters using Bayesian Optimization (BO), Asynchronous Successive Halving (ASHA), and Random Search (RS), all in parallel settings to improve computational efficiency. These optimizers also help ML architectures to adapt according to available datasets of diverse types. Key quantitative results show that the ASHA-optimized ML model performs well with larger datasets, providing an overall accuracy of 99.94% with the reduced computational load. Meanwhile, BO and RS attained accuracies of 99.90% and 98.0%, which proved effective for scarce datasets. This innovative framework integrates signal decomposition, feature selection, and optimization techniques, creating an efficient predictive maintenance tool. It improves fault classification, boosting the reliability of machinery in extraterrestrial environments and enhancing the safety and sustainability of long-term space missions. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-105004554435
"Multi-sensor heterogeneous data fusion method for rotor system diagnosis based on multi-mode residual network and discriminant correlation analysis Deep learning algorithms have become a research hotpot in the field of fault diagnosis due to their powerful feature adaptive extraction capabilities. However, the monitoring data used as the input of deep learning typically includes only single-sensor data (e.g. vibration signals), not the multi-sensor unstructured data (e.g. infrared images) that can provide fault information from different angles, resulting in low diagnostic accuracy and weak generalization ability of the built model. To apply multi-sensor heterogeneous monitoring data fully, a novel fusion diagnosis method based on multi-mode residual network (M-ResNet) and discriminant correlation analysis (DCA) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, M-ResNet composed of one-dimensional ResNet (1D-ResNet) and two-dimensional ResNet (2D-ResNet) is constructed to extract richer and more comprehensive fault features. 1D-ResNet and 2D-ResNet are used to process structured vibration signals and unstructured infrared images respectively, so as to obtain more comprehensive fault information. Secondly, DCA is used to fuse the vibration signal features and infrared image features extracted by M-ResNet to maximize the intra-class correlation and eliminate inter-class correlation of features, thereby improving the accuracy of fault diagnosis. Finally, the fusion features are input into the Softmax classifier to achieve fault classification. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by experiments on the rotor system, where it achieves a remarkable classification rate of 99.79%.

"A fault diagnosis model based on singular value manifold features, optimized SVMs and multi-sensor information fusion To achieve better fault diagnosis of rotating machinery, this paper presents a novel intelligent fault diagnosis model based on singular value manifold features (SVMF), optimized support vector machines (SVMs) and multi-sensor information fusion. Firstly, a new fault feature named SVMF is developed to better represent faults. SVMF is acquired by extracting manifold topology features of the singular spectrum. Compared with frequently-used fault features, the feature scale of SVMF is constant for variable rotating speed, and the extraction process of SVMF also has the effect of self-weighting. So SVMF has a better representation of faults. Then, to select optimal parameters for model training of SVMs, an improved fruit fly algorithm is proposed by introducing a guidance search mechanism and enhanced local search operation, and as a result both the convergence speed and accuracy are improved. Finally, the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory is introduced to fuse decision-level information from SVM models of multiple sensors. Information fusion eliminates the conflict of conclusions on fault diagnosis from multiple sensors, which leads to high robustness and accuracy of the fault diagnosis model. As a summary, the proposed method combines the advantages of SVMF in fault representation, SVMs in fault identification and the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory in information fusion, and as a result the proposed method will perform better at fault diagnosis. The proposed intelligent fault diagnosis model is subsequently applied to fault diagnosis of the gearbox. Experimental results show that the proposed diagnostic framework is versatile at detecting faults accurately. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.",2-s2.0-85087165689
"Fault detection and fault-tolerant control of autonomous steering system for intelligent vehicles combining Bi-LSTM and SPRT To solve the issues of low performance and low reliability of autonomous steering systems in intelligent vehicles, this paper proposes a novel fault detection and fault tolerance control (FDFTC) strategy. Firstly, an autonomous steering controller with rack displacement as the state feedback input is utilized to improve the system performance. Secondly, considering the importance of the rack displacement signal to the controller and the harsh operating environment of the displacement sensor, the software redundancy of the sensor is necessary. Therefore, a FDFTC strategy composed of Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) based rack displacement estimator and Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) is designed to effectively handle displacement sensor faults. Finally, comprehensive simulation and Hardware-in-Loop (HiL) test results show that the proposed FDFTC strategy can promptly detect sensor failures and efficiently restore vehicles to a stable state, thus effectively maintaining the trajectory tracking of intelligent vehicles when faults occur. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85149817613

"Radar-Enabled non-contact speed estimation for rotating electrical machinery Electric motors play a pivotal role in contemporary industrial processes, prompting the necessity for their continuous monitoring through an array of sensors in various applications. Among the crucial parameters under scrutiny, the operational speed of electric motors holds a prominent position. Current methods for speed detection conventionally entail the utilization of physically connected sensors or the measurement of some electrical variables. Nonetheless, a non-contact speed measurement approach with a mobile device promises low cost, efficiency, and even safety in some specific cases. This research delves into the remote speed detection of electric motors employing Continuous Wave radar technology. To this end, phase extraction techniques, which have demonstrated robust performance in diverse application domains, have been assessed for their efficacy in motor speed detection. First, five distinct methods have been utilized to extract the phase of baseband signals obtained from a 24 GHz IQ-demodulated radar system directed toward an asynchronous motor. These methodologies have undergone comprehensive evaluation in experimental measurements and simulation encompassing ideal and noisy conditions. Complex Signal Demodulation, one of the phase extraction methods, exhibits a noteworthy superiority over alternative approaches in motor speed measurement experiments. These experiments have entailed three different load scenarios and encompassed ten distinct speeds, equally spaced between 500 and 1400 rpm. The Complex Signal Demodulation method has delivered exceptional results, successfully detecting motor speeds across thirty experiments with a mean absolute percentage error of merely 0.08.

"Predictive framework for remaining useful life of roller bearings: Utilizing fractional generalized Pareto degradation model in performance evaluation Research on predictive frameworks for the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of mechanical systems is limited. This study proposes a comprehensive RUL prediction framework for roller bearings, integrating early failure assessment, adaptive failure threshold determination, and an adaptive drift fractional-order Pareto degradation model.

"Online Tuning of Koopman Operator for Fault-Tolerant Control: A Case Study of Mobile Robot Localising on Minimal Sensor Information Self-localisation is a critical concept in the context of autonomous navigation and control of mobile robots. The most prevalent method for localisation is sensor fusion. Nevertheless, there are certain situations where the robots are compelled to localise on minimal sensor information. Furthermore, the key challenge is determining how to localise if this minimal sensor information fails. This paper proposes a data-driven analytical redundancy technique to address this challenge in wheeled mobile robots. Initially, the localisation of the robot is performed using the encoder information alone to create a minimalistic approach. In such a situation, a fault or failure in the encoders makes the robot behave in an undesirable way. To mitigate this, we are proposing a method to use the information from the analytical models when a fault is detected. Specifically, we obtain the analytical models through data-driven techniques. By a step response experiment, the input voltage and output angular velocity data of the motor are collected. We then use the System Identification toolbox in MATLAB® (ver R2025a) and the Koopman framework to obtain different analytical models using the same data. We observe that these models experience errors at different input voltages of the motor, affecting the proposed method for handling the encoder fault. So, in this work, we use online tuning of the Koopman operator and experimentally demonstrate its effectiveness in handling the sensor fault on a mobile robot localising with minimal information. © 2025 by the authors.",2-s2.0-105008981399
"Integrating Feature Engineering with Deep Learning to Conduct Diagnostic and Predictive Analytics for Turbofan Engines The prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) is a critical issue in many areas, such as aircrafts, ships, automobile, and facility equipment. Although numerous methods have been presented to address this issue, most of them do not consider the impacts of feature engineering. Typical techniques include the wrapper approach (using metaheuristics), the embedded approach (using machine learning), and the extraction approach (using component analysis). For simplicity, this research considers feature selection and feature extraction. In particular, principal component analysis (PCA) and sliced inverse regression (SIR) are adopted in feature extraction while stepwise regression (SR), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) are used in feature selection. In feature selection, the original 15 sensors can be reduced to only four sensors that accumulate more than 80% degrees of importance and not seriously decrease the predictive performances. In feature extraction, only the top three principal components can account for more than 80% variances of original 15 sensors. Further, PCA combined with RF is more recommended than PCA and CNN (convolutional neural network) because it can achieve satisfactory performances without incurring tedious computation.  © 2022 Chih-Hsuan Wang and Ji-Yu Liu.",2-s2.0-85139560637
"Recurrent Neuronal Networks for the Prediction of the Temperature of a Synchronous Machine During Its Operation This work presents the development of an adaptive thermal protection system for synchronous machines (SMs), taking into consideration the final cooling temperature and the operation point of the machine. This system aims to improve current thermal protections, which consist of a fixed alarm and trip thresholds regardless of the generator’s operating point or ambient temperature. A recurrent neural network (RNN)-based approach has been employed to predict SM temperatures during operation. Multiple tests have been conducted on a specially designed test bench. Inside the windings and iron core of the 5.5 kVA generator, multiple Pt100 sensors have been installed to train the neural network with real temperature values, enabling accurate predictions. The selected RNN model is Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Its inputs include electrical variables and the inlet and outlet air temperatures of the SM’s cooling system. The results show that the model accurately defines warning and trip thresholds, significantly improving thermal protection, as these thresholds are no longer fixed values. Additionally, the study suggests validating the model under cooling system failures and exploring its application in water-cooled systems.

"A Continuous-Discrete Finite Memory Observer Design for a Class of Nonlinear Systems: Application to Fault Diagnosis This paper aims to develop a continuous-discrete finite memory observer (CD-FMO) for a class of nonlinear dynamical systems modeled by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with discrete measurements. The nonlinear systems under consideration are at least locally Lipschitz, which guarantees the existence and uniqueness of solution at each time instant. The proposed nonlinear observer uses a finite number of collected measurements to estimate the system state in the presence of measurement noise. Besides, a one-step prediction algorithm incorporated with an iterative-update scheme is performed to solve the integral problem caused by system nonlinearity, and an analysis of the numerical integration approximation error is given. The properties of estimation performance have been further proved in deterministic case and been analyzed by Monte Carlo simulation in stochastic cases. It is worth noting that the presented method has a finite-time convergence, while most nonlinear observers are usually asymptotically convergent. Another advantage of CD-FMO is that it has no initial value problem. For the application purpose, residuals are generated to implement fault detection cooperated with Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) control charts, while a bank of CD-FMOs is adopted to realize fault isolation for different sensor and actuator faults of the considered nonlinear robotic arm. The robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach are illustrated via the simulation results. © 2020 Tingting Zhang et al.",2-s2.0-85091929035
"Contamination Factor Prediction Using Contrived Data for Bearing Useful Life Estimation Bearing contamination, due to contaminants in the bearing raceway, is a leading cause of bearing failure by disrupting lubrication patterns. Over time, the over rolling of these contaminants will cause indentations to appear in bearing elements, accelerating the reduction of bearing remaining useful life. Hence, it is possible to use contamination to accelerate bearing damage in experimental conditions to generate failure data using purposeful failure methodologies. This paper explores the methodology for inducing bearing contamination, detecting bearing contamination based on sensor signals, and subsequently predicting the expected useful life by incorporating the bearing contamination characteristics. First, bearing data was generated from three separate cases of varying contamination level to create labeled bearing contamination data. The data was determined as separable based on differences in the time and frequency data using Fourier and statistical analysis. Second, the bearing contamination factor was determined using data-driven machine learning for each bearing to determine the ISO Life Modification Factor from ISO 281. Using different algorithms, the contamination factor was predicted within a 94% accuracy for each algorithm over a five-fold cross-validation, except for the neural network. Afterwards, the bearing useful life was assessed using the ISO life modification factor, based on the contamination factor, to determine the trend of bearing useful life under varying speed conditions and contamination factors. For future work, additional work is required for accounting changing parameters, such as bearing viscosity and load varying applications. Another item is defining an overall damage coefficient to identify changes to remaining useful life estimation based on changing contamination conditions. © 2022",2-s2.0-85138035709
"Entropy-based characterization of the transient phenomena—systemic approach The difficulties of predictive maintenance of power grids are related to the large spread of electrical infrastructures and the definition of early warning indicators. Such indicator is the partial discharge activities—which can be very informative about the rising insulation problems of electrical materials. However, the detection and the localization of the partial discharges are very complicate tasks and are currently subject to intensive studies in both theoretical and practical domains. The traditional way to approach the global surveillance of partial discharge sources is to first detect it and the second is to attempt to localize their positions. Despite the numerous proposed approaches, based on advanced transient signal processing tools, there is no any operational technique to efficiently asses the partial discharge sources in a real power network. In this context, our paper proposes a new approach based on the global evaluation of entropy of transient phenomena detected in a power network, without needing any localization of the sources of these phenomena. We will show that this approach provides an effective evaluation of partial discharges sources. Moreover, since the technique requires a reduced number of sensors, it is very advantageous to use in real contexts. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",2-s2.0-85103554008

"Aeroengine Control System Sensor Fault Diagnosis Based on CWT and CNN The aeroengine control system is a piece of complex thermal machinery which works under high-speed, high-load, and high-temperature environmental conditions over lengthy periods of time; it must be designed for the utmost reliability and safety to function effectively. The consequences of sensor faults are often extremely serious. The inherent complexity of the engine structure creates difficulty in establishing accurate mathematical models for the model-based sensor fault diagnosis. This paper proposes an intelligent fault diagnosis method for aeroengine sensors combining a deep learning algorithm with time-frequency analysis wherein the signal recognition problem is transformed into an image recognition problem. The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is first applied to seven common health condition signals in an engine control system sensor in order to generate scalograms that capture the characteristics of the signal. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained with preprocessed and labeled datasets is then used to extract the features of a time-frequency graph based on which faults can be identified and isolated. This method does not require modeling and design thresholds, so it has strong robustness and accuracy rate of over 97%.

"An Analysis of the WPT Function for Pattern Optimization to Detect Defects in Bearings New trends in maintenance techniques are oriented to digitization and prognosis. The new electronic devices based on IoT (Internet of Things) technology among others that support the industry 4.0 paradigm let enhance the traditional condition monitoring techniques to better understand and predict the state of a machine in service. Related to maintenance applications, one of the important steps in condition monitoring tasks for fault diagnosis is the selection of the optimal pattern to provide accurate results (avoiding fault positives/negatives) with adequate computation time. When implementing this, the selection of optimal parameters and thresholds for setting alarms are important to detect problems in the machine before the failure occurs. Vibratory signals have been proved to be a good variable to determine their mechanical behavior. Nevertheless, parameters obtained from time domain measurements are not computationally efficient nor good patterns to compare different machine conditions. In this sense, tools that represent the frequency domain or time–frequency domain have been useful to detect defects in rotating elements such as bearings. In this work, defects in ball bearings are studied using wavelet packet transform. For this, a methodology will be developed for the optimal selection of the mother wavelet, incorporating intelligent classification systems, and using a medium Gaussian support vector machine model. In this way, it will be verified that the correct selection of this function influences both the results and the ease and reliability of detection. The results using the selected mother wavelet will be compared to those using Daubechies 6, since it is the mother wavelet that has been used in previous works and which was selected based on experience.

"OASIS-Net: Morphological Attention Ensemble Learning for Surface Defect Detection Surface defect detection systems, which have advanced beyond conventional defect detection methods, lower the risk of accidents and increase working efficiency and productivity. Most fault detection techniques demand extra tools, such as ultrasonic sensors or lasers. With the advancements, these techniques can be examined without additional tools. We propose a morphological attention ensemble learning for surface defect detection called OASIS-Net, which can detect defects of three kinds (crack, efflorescence, and spalling) at the bounding box level. Based on the morphological analysis of each defect, OASIS-Net offers specialized loss functions for each defect that can be examined. Specifically, high-frequency image augmentation, connectivity attention, and penalty areas are used to detect cracks. It also compares the colors of the sensing objects and analyzes the image histogram peaks to improve the efflorescence-verification accuracy. Analyzing the ratio of the major and minor axes of the spalling through morphological comparison reveals that the spalling-detection accuracy improved. Defect images are challenging to obtain due to their properties. We labeled some data provided by AI hub and some concrete crack datasets and used them as custom datasets. Finally, an ensemble learning technique based on multi-task classification is suggested to learn and apply the specialized loss of each class to the model.

"A Joint Long Short-Term Memory and AdaBoost regression approach with application to remaining useful life estimation Along with wide application of sensors, multi-dimensional time-series data are commonly available for remaining useful life (RUL) estimation. This paper proposes a joint data-driven approach that adapts two models, AdaBoost regression and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), to estimate the RUL based on data trajectory extension. In RUL prediction, the data trajectories in the training set contain the data up to the units’ failure while the data trajectories in the testing set do not. Although this fact has a significant negative effect on the accuracy of RUL estimation, it is considered by few literatures. The proposed approach adapts the LSTM to learn the time series dependencies of training data and then extend the trajectories of testing data, aiming at reducing the variance of the lengths of data trajectory between the training and testing sets.

"Missing signal imputation for multi-channel sensing signals on rotary machinery by tensor factorization Multi-channel sensor fusion can be challenging for real-time machinery fault identification and diagnosis when a substantial amount of missing data exists. Usually, some (or even all) sensors may not function correctly during real-time data acquisition due to sensor malfunction or transmission issues. Additionally, multi-channel sensor fusion yields a large volume of data. Imputation of missing entries can also be challenging with a large volume of data, which can predominantly affect the accuracy of machinery fault diagnosis. However, how to impute a substantial amount of missing data for machinery fault identification is an open research question. In light of the above challenges, this paper proposes constructing time-domain tensors based on heterogeneous sensor signals. Subsequently, the fully Bayesian CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (FBCP) factorization method is adopted for missing data imputation of diverse bearing faults signals. To validate the effectiveness of this proposed method, a machinery fault simulator was used to collect diverse bearing fault signals by incorporating both acoustics and vibration sensors. A varying percentage of continuous missing signal scenarios are introduced at the random locations among different acoustics and vibration channels to construct incomplete tensors. Subsequently, the FBCP method was leveraged to complete the incomplete tensors and calculate estimated tensors. To evaluate the performance of continuous missing data imputation, relative standard errors are computed based on the estimated and actual time-domain tensors. Experimental results show that this proposed method can effectively impute a substantial portion of continuous missing data from diverse bearing fault scenarios. © 2023 The Author(s)",2-s2.0-85173280460
"Journal bearing seizure degradation assessment and remaining useful life prediction based on long short-term memory neural network Accurate bearing degradation assessment and remaining useful life (RUL) prediction may effectively avoid major disasters in manufacturing. With the rapid development of the computer industry, deep learning has emerged as a reliable algorithm for time-series prediction and has shown good performance. In this paper, the journal bearing seizure experiment was performed. The collected multi-sensor failure dataset is used for feature extraction and degradation indicator (DI) construction. The DI and working condition information are applied for degradation stage (DS) division by the fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm. Considering the transition of different DSs, the one-stage and multi-stage iteration prediction models based on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for RUL prediction are proposed. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to optimize model hyperparameters. The results show that the multi-stage iteration prediction may achieve the early warning of seizure failure and outperform the one-stage iteration prediction and traditional machine learning prediction. © 2020",2-s2.0-85088095022
"LSTM-Based Stacked Autoencoders for Early Anomaly Detection in Induction Heating Systems Due to the contactless operation of cookware on induction heating systems, the temperature of the cookware is measured remotely using thermal sensors placed on the center of the coil. Hence, the measurement error of these sensors increases if the cookware placement is not centered on the top of the coil. Therefore, this study presents a new data-driven anomaly detection method to detect overheated cookware using the thermal sensor of the case temperature of the inverter module. This method utilizes the long short-term memory (LSTM)-based autoencoder (AE) to learn from large training data of temperatures of cookware and the inverter. The learning of the LSTM-AE model is achieved by minimizing the residual error between the input and reconstructed input data. Then, the maximum residual error can be set to be a threshold value between the normal and abnormal operation. Finally, the learned LSTM-AE model is tested using new testing data that include both normal and abnormal cases. The testing results revealed that the LSTM-AE model can detect cookware overheating by using the inverter temperature only. In addition, the LSTM-AE model can detect the faults in the inverter side, such as poor air ventilation and a faulted cooling fan. Furthermore, we utilized different deep learning algorithms, such as the recurrent neural network (RNN) and the fully connected layers, in the internal layers of the AE. The results demonstrated that the LSTM-AE could detect anomalies earlier than the other models. © 2023 by the authors.",2-s2.0-85167825997
"SiMBA-Augmented Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Industrial Remaining Useful Life Prediction Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of industrial equipment is critical for achieving safe operations and optimizing predictive maintenance. To tackle the limitations of poor interpretability, inaccurate predictions, and high computational cost in complex system degradation modeling, this paper proposes SiMBA-PINN, a novel fusion framework that synergizes Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) with an enhanced state-space model (SiMBA). The framework achieves dynamic fusion of data-driven features and physical laws through a two-branch synergistic mechanism: the temporal modeling branch combines selective state-space SiMBA with Einstein Fast Fourier Transform (EinFFT)-based spectral mixing to efficiently capture cross-sensor temporal dependencies and degradation trends, while the physics-constraint branch embeds automatically differentiable partial differential equation residuals derived from domain-specific degradation mechanisms, enforcing physical consistency through deep hidden physics modeling. Here, the EinFFT-based spectral mixing leverages frequency-domain interactions to effectively blend the spectral components of multivariate time-series data, thereby enhancing the modeling of cross-sensor dependencies. Meanwhile, deep hidden physics modeling integrates physics-informed partial differential equation (PDE) residuals through differentiable operators, aligning the learned representations with domain-specific dynamics via a constraint-driven loss design. Experimental results from the C-MAPSS dataset confirm that the proposed model significantly outperforms PINN-, Mamba- and attention mechanism-based models, achieving State-of-the-Art RMSE on the most challenging FD004 subset. This physics-aware framework achieves deployable and interpretable RUL prediction by balancing accuracy with linear-time complexity. © 2025 by the authors.",2-s2.0-105008948672
"Text-Conditioned Diffusion-Based Synthetic Data Generation for Turbine Engine Sensor Analysis and RUL Estimation This paper introduces a novel framework for generating synthetic time-series data from turbine engine sensor readings using a text-conditioned diffusion model. The approach begins with dataset preprocessing, including correlation analysis, feature selection, and normalization. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transforms the normalized signals into three components, mapped to the RGB channels of an image. These components, combined with engine identifiers and cycle information, form compact 19 × 19 × 3 pixel images, later scaled to 512 × 512 × 3 pixels. A variational autoencoder (VAE)-based diffusion model, fine-tuned on these images, leverages text prompts describing engine characteristics to generate high-quality synthetic samples. A reverse transformation pipeline reconstructs synthetic images back into time-series signals, preserving the original engine-specific attributes while removing padding artifacts. The quality of the synthetic data is assessed by training Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation models and comparing performance across original, synthetic, and combined datasets. Results demonstrate that synthetic data can be beneficial for model training, particularly in the early epochs when working with limited datasets. Compared to existing approaches, which rely on generative adversarial networks (GANs) or deterministic transformations, the proposed framework offers enhanced data fidelity and adaptability. This study highlights the potential of text-conditioned diffusion models for augmenting time-series datasets in industrial Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) applications. © 2025 by the authors.",2-s2.0-105006669210
"Multi-branch convolutional neural network with generalized shaft orbit for fault diagnosis of active magnetic bearing-rotor system Fault diagnosis based on vibration signals in active magnetic bearing-rotor systems is an important research topic. However, it is difficult to obtain discriminative features to represent faults due to the nonlinear and non-stationary characteristics of the vibration signals and diverse sources of failures. Hence, this paper proposes a novel end-to-end learning mechanism of multi-sensor data fusion to learn fault representation based on the structural characteristics of active magnetic bearings. Taking the five displacement sensors of active magnetic bearing as signal sources, generalized shaft orbits are constructed and converted into discrete 2D images. Based these 2D images, a multi-branch convolutional neural network is designed to achieve high discriminative features and fault types. The experiments are performed on the rig supported by active magnetic bearings, and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified, proving it suitability in cases with changing rotating speeds and sample lengths. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85096968916

"Feature-informed machine learning for detecting material deformation and failure in aluminum pipes under bending load using acoustic emission sensors Plastic deformation or the initiation of cracks in metal materials generates elastic wave energy, which can be captured by acoustic emission (AE) sensors. This AE energy can be leveraged for early leak detection, potentially before an actual leak occurs in metal piping systems. While much of the existing research focuses on tensile testing, limited work has been done on detecting plastic deformation or cracks during bending deformation in metal pipes using AE signals. This study evaluates and compares several feature-based machine learning techniques to identify the onset of plastic deformation or early failure in aluminum pipes under bending conditions. The results show that the average accuracy for the feature-based ML models is 79.8 %, with the Support Vector Machine achieving the highest accuracy of 83.5 %. Additionally, we propose a novel Feature-Informed Convolutional Neural Network (FI-CNN), which integrates the features into the CNN framework, yielding an accuracy of 92.7 %, outperforming the traditional machine learning methods.

"Sensing response of Pd-modified Ti3C2O2 for dissolved gas molecules in power transformer oil Mineral oil is the primary insulation dielectrics of power transformers. Multiple gas components can be generated due to the decomposition of insulation oil in response to the high electric field strength and high temperature. To detect trace gas components, such as C2H2, C2H4 and CH4, is beneficial to assess the healthy status of transformers and prevent the occurrence of faults. Although Ti3C2O2 shows potential in the sensing of polar gas molecules, the hydrocarbons gas molecules in insulating oil are difficult to be sensed by intrinsic Ti3C2O2. A Pd-doped Ti3C2O2 structure is proposed to increase the adsorption ability for the decomposition gas molecules in insulating oil. Firstly, the binding energy of Ti3C2O2 and Pd on four different doping sites was simulated. It is found that the substrate structure with Hole site doping has the finest stability. Secondly, the structure of the substrate with C2H2, C2H4 and CH4 gases adsorption was simulated. It indicates that C2H2 and C2H4 can form stable chemical bonds with the proposed substrate. In order to evaluate the conductivity and transfer electrons of the proposed substrate after the gas adsorption, the DOS, HOMO-LUMO, and DCD analysis were performed. The results show that after Pd doping, the adsorption energy of C2H2 and C2H4 is 5.076 and 4.750 times higher than that of the intrinsic Ti3C2O2, respectively. The transfer charge is 5.019 and 3.767 times higher than that of the intrinsic Ti3C2O2, respectively. Meanwhile, the work function analysis was performed to estimate the validation of proposed Pd-doped Ti3C2O2 as a FET-type gas sensor.

"An Internet-of-Things-Based Dynamic Scheduling Optimization Method for Unreliable Flexible Manufacturing Systems under Complex Operational Conditions The dynamic scheduling problem (DSP) in unreliable flexible manufacturing systems (UFMSs) with concurrency, conflicts, resource sharing, and sequential operations is a complex optimization problem that requires the use of efficient solution methodologies. The effectiveness of scheduling UFMSs relies on the quality of equipment maintenance. Currently, UFMSs with consistently large queues of parts awaiting service employ a repair-after-failure approach as a standard maintenance procedure. This method may require unexpected resources, incur costs, consume time, and potentially disrupt the operations of other UFMSs, either partially or fully. This study suggests using a predictive maintenance (PdM) strategy that utilizes the Internet of Things (IoT) to predict and avoid early mechanical equipment failures before they happen in UFMSs, thereby reducing unplanned downtime and enhancing reliability. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to construct timed Petri net (TPN) models using the IoT for the PdM configuration of mechanical equipment in the dynamic scheduling problem of UFMSs. This necessitates that users represent the specific problem using TPNs. The process of PN modeling requires the utilization of domain knowledge pertaining to the target problems as well as to machine information. However, it is important to note that the modeling rules for PNs are straightforward and limited in number. Consequently, the TPN model is applied to generate and formulate mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) instances accurately. This is done to identify the optimal production cycle time, which may be implemented in real-life scenarios. Several UFMS instances are used to demonstrate the applications and effectiveness of the proposed method. The computational results demonstrate that the proposed method shows superior solution quality, effectively solves instances for a total of 10 parts and 6 machines, and achieves a solution in a reasonable CPU time. © 2024 by the authors.",2-s2.0-85189037048
"Detection of Damage on Inner and Outer Races of Ball Bearings Using a Low-Cost Monitoring System and Deep Convolution Neural Networks Bearings are vital components in machinery, and their malfunction can result in equipment damage and reduced productivity. As a result, considerable research attention has been directed toward the early detection of bearing faults. With recent rapid advancements in machine learning algorithms, there is increasing interest in proactively diagnosing bearing faults by analyzing signals obtained from bearings.

This study proposes a systematic predictive maintenance framework based on the hybrid multisensor fusion technique of fuzzy rough set feature selection and stacked ensemble for the efficient classification of fault conditions characterised by uncertainties. First, a feature vector of time-domain features was extracted from 17 multiple sensor signals. Then, a comparative study of six different Fuzzy Rough Set Feature Selection (FRFS) methods was employed to select the various combinations of optimal feature subsets for various faults classification tasks. The determined optimal feature subsets then served as inputs for training the stacked ensemble (ESB(STK)). In the ESB(STK), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN), C4.5 Decision Tree (C4.5 DT), Logistic Regression (LR), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) served as the base classifiers while the LR was selected to be the metaclassifier.

"Adsorption and sensing properties of TiO2-modified MoSe2 monolayer for SF6 decomposition components based on the first-principles As crucial components in power systems, SF6 gas-insulated equipment inevitably develops insulation defects and faults over long-term operation, leading to the decomposition of SF6 gas. Therefore, detecting SF6 decomposition components is essential for assessing the operational status of SF6 gas-insulated equipment and ensuring the safe and stable operation of power systems. Based on first principles, the modification mechanism of TiO2 on MoSe2 was explored, and optimal adsorption models for gases SO2, H2S, SOF2, and SO2F2 on this composite material were established. The adsorption characteristics of each system were analyzed through parameters such as adsorption energy, adsorption distance, charge transfer, electron density difference, and density of states, and the sensing properties of the systems were discussed using parameters including changes in frontier molecular orbitals, desorption time, and sensitivity. The results indicate that TiO2–MoSe2 has difficulty capturing SO2F2, but exhibits chemisorption for SO2, H2S, and SOF2 with adsorption energies of −1.25 eV, −0.99 eV, and −3.40 eV, respectively. Upon adsorption of SO2, TiO2–MoSe2 shows a significant change in electrical conductivity, a desorption time of 4.51 s (at 498 K), and a strong sensitivity response. However, the response to H2S is relatively weak, with lower sensitivity. Therefore, this material is suitable for detecting SO2 but not H2S. TiO2–MoSe2 demonstrates a significant response and excellent sensitivity to SOF2; however, the adsorption process lacks repeatability.

"Fault-Tolerant Closed-Loop Controller Using Online Fault Detection by Neural Networks This paper presents an online model-free sensor fault-tolerant control scheme capable of tolerating the most common faults affecting an induction motor. This approach involves using neural networks for fault detection to provide the controller with sufficient information to counteract adverse consequences due to sensor faults, such as degradation in performance, reliability, and even failures in the control system. The proposed approach does not consider the knowledge of the nominal model of the system or when the fault may occur. Therefore, a high-order recurrent neural network trained online by the Extended Kalman Filter is used to obtain a mathematical model of the system. The obtained model is used to synthesize a discrete-time sliding mode control. Then, the fault-detection and -isolation stage is performed by independent neural networks, which have as input the signal from the current sensor and the position sensor, respectively. In this way, the neural classifiers continuously monitor the sensors, showing the ability to know the sensor status. The combination of controller and fault detection maintains the operation of the motor during the time of the fault occurrence, whether due to sensor disconnection, degradation, or connection failure. In fact, the MLP neural network achieves an accuracy between 95% and 99% and shows an AUC of 97% to 99%, and this neural network correctly classifies true positives with acceptable performance.

"Multi phenomena melt pool sensor data fusion for enhanced process monitoring of laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing Finding actionable trends in laser-based metal additive manufacturing process monitoring data is challenging owing to the diversity and complexity of the underlying physical interactions. A single monitoring solution that captures a particular process phenomenon, such as a photodiode that tracks melt pool intensity, is not alone capable of evaluating process stability or detecting flaw formation with sufficient precision for routine application in industry. In this work, to improve flaw detection performance, we adopted a data fusion approach that captures multiple process phenomena. To demonstrate this, we acquired data from laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) builds of cylindrical specimens produced with different laser spot sizes, emulating defocusing due to process faults such as thermal lensing. The resulting specimens had porosity of varying types and severity, quantified by post-build non-destructive X-ray computed tomography, Archimedes density measurements, and destructive metallographic characterization. During the build, the melt pool state was monitored with two coaxial high-speed video cameras and a temperature field imaging system. Physically intuitive low-level melt pool signatures, such as melt pool temperature, shape and size, and spatter intensity were extracted from this high-dimensional, image-based sensor data. These process signatures were subsequently used as input features in relatively simple machine learning models, such as a support vector machine, which were trained to detect laser defocusing, and in addition, predict porosity type and severity. The results show that the data fusion approach significantly enhanced system performance by reducing the overall false positive rate from ∼ 0.1 to ∼ 0.001 without sacrificing the true positive rate (∼0.90). These results were at par with a black-box, deep machine learning approach (convolutional neural network). © 2022 The Authors",2-s2.0-85134798775
"Model-based tool wear detection and fault diagnosis for end mill in various cutting conditions In recent developments in the field of manufacturing systems, there has been a growing emphasis on optimizing cutting conditions. These optimizations are primarily based on intricate parameters, such as the material removal rate (MRR), surface roughness, and position accuracy. Simultaneously, there's an increasing focus on enhancing manufacturing efficiency through equipment maintenance strategies that consider parameters, such as corrosion, pressure, temperature, vibration, and other environmental factors. Wear is inevitable during processing, which affects productivity. It is generated in various forms, such as flank, crater, and edge wear, which reduce the tool lifespan and impact machining quality, especially by increasing the cutting forces. Various studies have been conducted to address this issue. Direct measurements using microscopes have high accuracy but require interruption during the process, which adversely affects efficiency and productivity. As a solution, the modern era has witnessed an increase in indirect methods. These methods are often sensor-based, capture data during the machining process, and employ various models, including emerging artificial intelligence techniques, for predicting tool wear. However, these methods have problems with environmental susceptibility, reduced reliability, limitations of application, and excessive costs. This paper suggests a tool wear integrated cutting load prediction model, tool wear detection, and fault diagnosis mechanism. The tool-wear-integrated cutting-load prediction model was constructed by combining the cutting-load prediction and tool-wear models. The coefficients of the model were derived from the actual cutting data extracted by the spindle load. Tool wear detection was implemented by dividing regions based on the tendency of the coefficient of the constructed tool wear integrated cutting load prediction model and the errors between the predicted and actual values. The proposed model demonstrated a performance comparable to that of the existing models in a single-cutting-condition path. However, it excelled in extracting the tool wear coefficients in paths with a mixture of various cutting conditions, which was not achievable with conventional models. Based on these coefficients, the cutting force was predicted with a maximum error of 3.3 %. Also, an accurate determination of the tool-wear regions was possible.

Currently, the application of non-contact displacement sensors in blade vibration measurements has enabled the widespread analysis of nonlinear dynamic characteristics, such as natural frequency deviations and spectral anomalies, to enhance crack fault diagnosis in rotating machinery. However, these two dynamic characteristics are not distinguishable for crack changes, especially for incipient cracks, leading to potential misdiagnosis. In this paper, a dynamic characteristic called the envelope diagram image of vibration responses (EDIVR) was extracted from blade tip displacement signals collected during acceleration–deceleration cycles for crack diagnosis. Initially, considering the breathing effect of fatigue cracks, a structural dynamics finite element model of a blade containing a breathing crack is established to calculate its dynamic response under aerodynamic force. Subsequently, the sensitivity of three characteristics (natural frequency, frequency spectrum, and EDIVR) to crack fault changes is quantitatively compared based on the simulated response signals. Experimental validation confirms the accuracy of the proposed dynamic model and the effectiveness of the proposed feature. The study shows that under identical operational conditions, blades with cracks of equivalent depth and location exhibit maximum sensitivity to crack detection when EDIVR dynamic characteristics are employed as the fault diagnostic criterion. Moreover, this characteristic is less susceptible to signal noise interference compared to other dynamic characteristics, enhancing its potential for crack diagnosis in engineering applications. © 2025 by the authors.",2-s2.0-105006845473
"Fault-Tolerant Control for Three-Tank System in Case of Sensor Faults This research paper would be devoted to the application of a fault-tolerant control (FTC) for a benchmark system composed of three interconnected tanks in case of sensor faults. The control scheme includes two blocks: fault detection and isolation (FDI) block and a control law reconfiguration block. The strategy of the FDI method is based on a bank of high gain observers; each of them is constructed to estimate the system state vector. Thus, the diagnostic signal-residuals are generated by the comparison of measured and estimated outputs and the faulty sensor is isolated. The reconfiguration block performs an update of the controller parameters according to the operating mode. The application of this method to a pilot plant demonstrates that the hydrographic system maintains quite performances after sensor faults occurrence.  © 2021 Mondher Amor et al.",2-s2.0-85100256974
"Intelligent monitoring and diagnostics using a novel integrated model based on deep learning and multi-sensor feature fusion Monitoring and diagnostics are vitally important in smart manufacturing systems since early detection can reduce downtime, protect environment, improve work efficiency, and save cost. The current work for monitoring and diagnostics mainly process the system condition data from multisensor by some mainstream machine learning and deep learning methods. However, these methods’ performance is limited by the following weaknesses: (1) The multi-sensor information are not well used, and its feature fusion is not considerd. (2) Current advanced methods, such as convolution neural network (CNN), long short-term memory neural network (LSTM), are still facing some problems due to their inherent structures. CNN does not consider the sequential and temporal dependency; LSTM does not consider spatial correlation. Thus, a novel integrated model based on deep learning and multi-sensor feature fusion is proposed. The developed parallel convolutional neural network (PCNN) in the integrated model can achieve multisensory feature fusion to overcome the first weakness. The integrated CNN, deep residual networks (DRN), LSTM, can solve the second point. Specifically, the signals collected from multiple sensors are turned into multi-channel images, and the PCNN is designed to extract and fused the features of the converted images. Then, DRN and LSTM are developed to accept the extracted high-dimensional features by the designed CNN and generate the prediction results by fully connected neural networks. Two experiments, including cutting tool monitoring and bearing fault diagnosis, are conducted to validate the superiority and robustness of the proposed method. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, the results show that the proposed model is more robust and accurate. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85086988427
"Research on rolling bearing state health monitoring and life prediction based on PCA and Internet of things with multi-sensor It is an important means to improve the utilization rate and reliability of the equipment to realize the state health monitoring of the mechanical equipment by building the Internet of things with multi-sensor. Studying the correlation of multi-source and similar sensor signals can improve the comprehensive utilization of information. In this paper, the similarity measure is used to describe and analyze the correlation between the multi-sensor monitoring signals of rolling bearing, and the failure bearing data is used to realize the comprehensive utilization of information prediction of service bearing life. To overcome the disadvantage of inconsistent prediction results and low reliability of rolling bearing single feature characterization and similarity life prediction algorithm, a comprehensive similarity life prediction method of rolling bearing based on multi-dimensional feature fusion is proposed in this paper. Nine degradation features of bearing vibration signal, such as kurtosis and root mean square, are extracted. Based on principal component analysis (PCA), multi-dimensional features are fused to fully characterize the operation state of rolling bearings. The maximum and minimum life values of rolling bearings given by different features under normal conditions are obtained. By calculating the comprehensive similarity, the corresponding life proportional adjustment functions are constructed respectively. The life results predicted by PCA fusion features are corrected in real time, and the predicted life intervals of the monitoring bearings are given. The experimental data of rolling bearings at the University of Cincinnati are used to carry out the applied research. Compared with the single time domain feature prediction results, the multi-dimensional feature prediction algorithm describes the life information of rolling bearings from various angles, and the prediction results are more accurate and reliable.

"T2-LSTM-Based AI System for Early Detection of Motor Failure in Chemical Plants In the chemical industry, stable reactor operation is essential for consistent production. Motor failures can disrupt operations, resulting in economic losses and safety risks. Traditional monitoring methods, based on human experience and simple current monitoring, often need to be faster and more accurate. The rapid development of artificial intelligence provides powerful tools for early fault detection and maintenance. In this study, the Hotelling T2 index is used to calculate the root mean square values of the normal motor’s x, y, and z axes.

"Refined composite multivariate multiscale symbolic dynamic entropy and its application to fault diagnosis of rotating machine Accurate and efficient identification of various fault categories, especially for the big data and multisensory system, is a challenge in rotating machinery fault diagnosis. For the diagnosis problems with massive multivariate data, extracting discriminative and stable features with high efficiency is the significant step. This paper proposes a novel feature extraction method, called Refined Composite multivariate Multiscale Symbolic Dynamic Entropy (RCmvMSDE), based on the refined composite analysis and multivariate multiscale symbolic dynamic entropy. Specifically, multivariate multiscale symbolic dynamic entropy can capture more identification information from multiple sensors with superior computational efficiency, while refine composite analysis guarantees its stability. The abilities of the proposed method to measure the complexity of multivariate time series and identify the signals with different components are discussed based on adequate simulation analysis. Further, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method on fault diagnosis tasks, a centrifugal pump dataset under constant speed condition and a ball bearing dataset under time-varying speed condition are applied.

"New Insights on Robust Control of Tilting Trains with Combined Uncertainty and Performance Constraints A rigorous study on optimized robust control is presented for non-preview (nulling-type) high-speed tilting rail vehicles. The scheme utilizes sensors on the vehicle’s body, contrary to that of preview tilt (which uses prior rail track information). Tilt with preview is the industrial norm nowadays but is a complex scheme (both in terms of inter-vehicle signal connections and when it comes to straightforward fault detection). Non-preview tilt is simple (as it essentially involves an SISO control structure) and more effective in terms of (the localization of) failure detection. However, the non-preview tilt scheme suffers from performance limitations due to non-minimum-phase zeros in the design model (due to the compound effect of the suspension dynamic interaction and sensor combination used for feedback control) and presents a challenging control design problem. We proposed an optimized robust control design offering a highly improved non-preview tilt performance via a twofold model representation, i.e., (i) using the non-minimum phase design model and (ii) proposing a factorized design model version with the non-minimum phase characteristics treated as uncertainty. The impact of the designed controllers on tilt performance deterministic (curving acceleration response) and stochastic (ride quality) trade-off was methodically investigated. Nonlinear optimization was employed to facilitate fine weight selection given the importance of the ride quality as a bounded constraint in the design process. © 2023 by the authors.",2-s2.0-85166214403
"Manufacturing Maps, a Novel Tool for Smart Factory Management Based on Petri Nets and Big Data Mini-Terms This article defines a new concept for real-time factory management—manufacturing maps. Manufacturing maps are generated from two fundamental elements, mini-terms and Petri nets. Mini-terms are sub-times of a technical cycle, the time it takes for any component to perform its task. A mini-term, by definition, is a sub-cycle time and it would only make sense to use the term in connection with production improvement. Previous studies have shown that when the sub-cycle time worsens, this indicates that something unusual is happening, enabling anticipation of line failures. As a result, a mini-term has dual functionality, since, on the one hand, it is a production parameter and, on the other, it is a sensor used for predictive maintenance. This, combined with how easy and cheap it is to extract relevant data from manufacturing lines, has resulted in the mini-term becoming a new paradigm for predictive maintenance, and, indirectly, for production analysis. Applying this parameter using big data for machines and components can enable the complete modeling of a factory using Petri nets. This article presents manufacturing maps as a hierarchical construction of Petri nets in which the lowest level network is a temporary Petri net based on mini-terms, and in which the highest level is a global view of the entire plant. The user of a manufacturing map can select intermediate levels, such as a specific production line, and perform analysis or simulation using real-time data from the mini-term database. As an example, this paper examines the modeling of the 8XY line, a multi-model welding line at the Ford factory in Almussafes (Valencia), where the lower layers are modeled until the mini-term layer is reached. The results, and a discussion of the possible applications of manufacturing maps in industry, are provided at the end of this article. © 2022 by the authors.",2-s2.0-85136969161
"Streamlined Bearing Fault Detection Using Artificial Intelligence in Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors Permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) are widely used in industrial applications due to their high efficiency and reliability. However, bearing faults remain a critical issue, necessitating robust fault detection strategies. This paper proposes an edge–fog–cloud architecture for bearing fault detection with a specific focus on implementing an efficient and non-intrusive edge-based solution. The methodology involves preprocessing motor current signals through fast Fourier transform (FFT) and Hilbert transform-based envelope analysis to extract harmonics without being masked by the fundamental supply frequency. These features are used to train machine learning models, considering variations in both speed and load. Experimental validation is conducted using the Paderborn University Bearing Dataset, demonstrating that the proposed approach achieves exceptional accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, exceeding 0.98 with models such as XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. While CatBoost exhibits the highest performance, LightGBM is selected as the optimal model due to its significantly reduced training time, making it well suited for edge computing applications.

"RUL Prediction for Piezoelectric Vibration Sensors Based on Digital-Twin and LSTM Network Piezoelectric vibration sensors (PVSs) are widely used in high-temperature environments, such as vibration measurements in aero-engines, because of their high accuracy, small size, and high temperature resistance. Accurate prediction of its RUL (Remaining Useful Life) is essential for applying and maintaining PVSs. Based on PVSs’ characteristics and main failure modes, this work combines the Digital-Twin (DT) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict the RUL of PVSs. In this framework, DT can provide rich data collection, analysis, and simulation capabilities, which have advantages in RUL prediction, and LSTM network has good results in predicting time sequence data. The proposed method exploits the advantages of those techniques in feature data collection, sample optimization, and RUL multiclassification. To verify the prediction of this method, a DT platform is established to conduct PVS degradation tests, which generates sample datasets, then the LSTM network is trained and validated. It has been proved that prediction accuracy is more than 99.7%, and training time is within 94 s. Based on this network, the RUL of PVSs is predicted using different test samples.

"Fluorescence-enhanced microfluidic sensor for highly sensitive in-situ detection of copper ions in lubricating oil Sensitive on-line detection of Cu2+ in lubricating oil of marine power plant is important for displaying equipment wear status and fault pre-judgment in real time. However, there are few reports on in-situ, portable and highly sensitive Cu2+ detection devices in organic media before. In this report, CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) are employed as fluorescence probe for Cu2+ detection in microfluidic chip. The size effect of the CsPbBr3 QDs on the detection performances is firstly investigated. To obtain preferable sensitivity and detection limit, polymethyl methacrylate opal photonic crystals (PMMA OPCs) film is developed as microfluidic sensor substrate, which can tremendously improve the fluorescence intensity of PQDs as high as 26-fold. The enhancement effect can be attributed to the coupling between photonic crystal stopband effect and the excitation light field. Moreover, the use of photomultiplier module for fluorescence signal measurement enables the detection device to be portable. The novel strategy offers the advantages of higher sensitivity (8.62 μM–1) and lower detection limit (0.40 nM).

"From fault tree to fault graph: Bayesian network embedding-based fault isolation for complex equipment Fault isolation (or fault location) aims to identify the component responsible for the defective behavior's symptoms, which is a significant part of predictive maintenance. However, it is difficult to sort out which component is accountable for the fault characteristics in complex equipment, due to limited space for sensor setup and its synergetic process. Different from fault tree, this paper proposes a large-scale fault graph to locate the fault components through probability inference, which leverages domain expertise. Specifically, a fault graph (type of knowledge graph) has been established firstly using hierarchical structure and domain-specific knowledge. Following, a Multi-field hyperbolic embedding method has been applied to vectorize the node and edge, maximally preserving the logical rules within the fault graph. Next, Bayesian network has been utilized to model the causality of fault graph with the well-trained graph embedding, then reasoning the possible fault component. Lastly, a maintenance case of oil drilling equipment is carried out, where the proposed method has been contrasted with other cutting-edge models to demonstrate its effectiveness in embedding properties and inference performance.

"Data-Driven Fault Diagnosis in Water Pipelines Based on Neuro-Fuzzy Zonotopic Kalman Filters This work presents a data-driven approach for diagnosing sensor faults and leaks in hydraulic pipelines using neuro-fuzzy Zonotopic Kalman Filters (ZKF).

"Real-world data-driven machine-learning-based optimal sensor selection approach for equipment fault detection in a thermal power plant Due to growing electricity demand, developing an efficient fault-detection system in thermal power plants (TPPs) has become a demanding issue. The most probable reason for failure in TPPs is equipment (boiler and turbine) fault. Advance detection of equipment fault can help secure maintenance shutdowns and enhance the capacity utilization rates of the equipment. Recently, an intelligent fault diagnosis based on multivariate algorithms has been introduced in TPPs. In TPPs, a huge number of sensors are used for process maintenance. However, not all of these sensors are sensitive to fault detection. The previous studies just relied on the experts’ provided data for equipment fault detection in TPPs. However, the performance of multivariate algorithms for fault detection is heavily dependent on the number of input sensors. The redundant and irrelevant sensors may reduce the performance of these algorithms, thus creating a need to determine the optimal sensor arrangement for efficient fault detection in TPPs. Therefore, this study proposes a novel machine-learning-based optimal sensor selection approach to analyze the boiler and turbine faults. Finally, real-world power plant equipment fault scenarios (boiler water wall tube leakage and turbine electric motor failure) are employed to verify the performance of the proposed model. The computational results indicate that the proposed approach enhanced the computational efficiency of machine-learning models by reducing the number of sensors up to 44% in the water wall tube leakage case scenario and 55% in the turbine motor fault case scenario. Further, the machine-learning performance is improved up to 97.6% and 92.6% in the water wall tube leakage and turbine motor fault case scenarios, respectively. © 2021 by the authors.

"Fault diagnosis of multi-channel data by the CNN with the multilinear principal component analysis The multi-channel sensor data are widely collected during a manufacturing process to detect the variation of product quality. Multi-channel data can provide comprehensive information for the fault diagnosis, while the cross-correlation and redundant information in the data make it difficult to analyze using common methods. In this paper, the tensor structure and characteristics of a multi-channel dataset are investigated. After that, a novel fault diagnosis method is proposed by introducing the multilinear subspace learning algorithm into deep learning technologies. The dimension of the multi-channel data is reduced using the Multilinear Principal Component Analysis that does not destroy the tensor structure. The CNN is then used to extract features and build a classification model for fault diagnosis. The proposed method is compared with existing methods in the case study about a practical multi-operation forging process.

"Cross Domain Data Generation for Smart Building Fault Detection and Diagnosis Benefiting extensively from the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor network technologies, the modern smart building achieves thermal comfort. It prevents energy wastage by performing automatic Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) to maintain the good condition of its air-conditioning systems. Often, real-time multi-sensor measurements are collected, and supervised learning algorithms are adopted to exploit the data for an effective FDD. A key issue with the supervised methods is their dependence on well-labeled fault data, which is difficult to obtain in many real-world scenarios despite the abundance of unlabelled sensor data. Intuitively, the problem can be greatly alleviated if some well-labeled fault data collected under a particular setting can be re-used and transferred to other cases where labeled fault data is challenging or costly. Bearing this idea, we proposed a novel Adversarial Cross domain Data Generation (ACDG) framework to impute missing fault data for building fault detection and diagnosis where labeled data is costly. Unlike traditional Transfer Learning (TL)-related applications that adapt models or features learned in the source domain to the target domain, ACDG essentially “generates” the unknown sensor data for the target setting (target domain). This is accomplished by capturing the data patterns and common knowledge from known counterparts in the other setting (source domain), the inter-domain knowledge, and the intra-domain relations. The proposed ACDG framework is tested with the real-world Air Handling Unit (AHU) fault dataset of the ASHRAE Research Project 1312. Extensive experimental results on the cross-domain AHU fault data showed the effectiveness of ACDG in supplementing the data for a missing fault category by exploiting the underlying commonalities between different domain settings. © 2022 by the authors.",2-s2.0-85141832649
"Remaining Useful Life Prediction Based on Multi-Representation Domain Adaptation All current deep learning-based prediction methods for remaining useful life (RUL) assume that training and testing data have similar distributions, but the existence of various operating conditions, failure modes, and noise lead to insufficient data with similar distributions during the training process, thereby reducing RUL prediction performance. Domain adaptation can effectively solve this problem by learning the cross-domain invariant features of the source domain and target domain to reduce the distribution difference. However, most domain adaptive methods extract the source domain and target domain features into a single space for feature alignment, which may leave out effective information and affect the accuracy of prediction. To address this problem, we propose a data-driven approach named long short-term memory network and multi-representation domain adaptation (LSTM-MRAN). We standardize and process the degraded sensor data with a sliding time window, use LSTM to extract features from the degraded data, and mine the time series information between the data. Then, we use multiple substructures in multi-representation domain adaptation to extract features of the source domain and target domain from different spaces and align features by minimizing conditional maximum mean difference (CMMD) loss functions. The effectiveness of the method is verified by the CMAPSS dataset. Compared with methods without domain adaptation and other transfer learning methods, the proposed method provides more reliable RUL prediction results under datasets with different operating conditions and failure modes. © 2022 by the authors.",2-s2.0-85144674262

"Leak localization in industrial-fluid pipelines based on acoustic emission burst monitoring This paper proposes a new approach to leak localization in industrial-fluid pipelines. Although the leak localization problem has been the subject of numerous scientific and engineering research projects and publications, further improvements would be useful in specific applications, for example, leak localization in metal pipelines which are elements of a huge pipeline network operating in manufacturing industry. The proposed methodology, which is designed to improve accuracy of leak location in steel pipelines, exploits a burst phenomenon in acoustic emission (AE) signals and combines signal processing with a physical wave-propagation model. The algorithm seeks AE bursts based on a detection theorem and then combines neighboring bursts into unique burst groups. Filtered AE events which are pairs of bursts from two signal channels allows information extraction of fault location. The combination of grouping and filtering elucidates event concentration and reduces error.

This is due to the dependence of successful Fult Detection (FD) method on correct sensory measurements that suffer from various soft sensory faults such as bias, drift, scaling factor, and hard faults that can be detected independently.

"Fault Diagnosis and Identification of Abnormal Variables Based on Center Nearest Neighbor Reconstruction Theory Fault diagnosis and identification are important goals in ensuring the safe production of industrial processes. This article proposes a data reconstruction method based on Center Nearest Neighbor (CNN) theory for fault diagnosis and abnormal variable identification. Firstly, the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) method is used to monitor the process and determine whether there is a fault. Secondly, when there is a fault, a high-precision CNN reconstruction algorithm is used to reconstruct each variable and calculate the reconstructed control index. The variable that reduces the control index the most is replaced with the reconstructed variable in sequence, and the iteration is carried out until the control index is within the control range, and all abnormal variables are finally determined. The accuracy of the CNN reconstruction method was verified through a numerical example. Additionally, it was confirmed that the method is not only suitable for fault diagnosis of a single sensor but also can be used sensor faults that occur simultaneously or propagate due to variable correlation.

Our core hypothesis is that these signals contain vibrations caused by brake disc deformation. Since faults of this kind are typically monitored by the driver of the vehicle, the development of automatic fault-detection systems becomes more important with the rise of autonomous driving. In addition, the new brake boosters separate the brake pedal from the hydraulic system which results in less significant effects on the brake pedal force. Our paper offers two important contributions. Firstly, we provide a detailed description of our novel measurement scheme, the type and placement of the used sensors, signal acquisition and data characteristics. Then, in the second part of our paper we detail mathematically justified signal representations and different algorithms to distinguish between deformed and normal brake discs. For the proper understanding of the phenomenon, different brake discs were used with measured runout values. Since, in addition to brake disc deformation, the vibrations recorded by our accelerometers are nonlinearly dependent on a number of factors (such as the velocity, suspension, tire pressure, etc.), data-driven models are considered. Through experiments, we show that the proposed methods can be used to recognize faults in the braking system caused by brake disc deformation. © 2024 by the authors.",2-s2.0-85191416928
"Using Event Data to Build Predictive Engine Failure Models Diesel engine failures are one reason for delays and breakdowns on the UK rail network, resulting in significant fines and related financial penalties for a train operating company. Preventing such failures is the ultimate goal, but forecasting or predicting future failures before they occur would be highly desirable. In this study, we take real world Diesel Multiple Unit sensor data, recorded in the form of event data, and repurpose it for the remote condition monitoring of critical diesel engine operations. A methodology based on windowing of data is proposed that demonstrates the effective processing of event data for predictive modelling. This study specifically looks at predicting engine failures, and through this methodology, models trained on the processed data resulted in accuracies of 88%. Explainable AI methods are then utilised to provide feature importance explanations for the model’s performance. This information helps the end user understand specifically which sensor data from the larger dataset is most relevant for predicting engine failures. The work presented is useful to the railway industry, but more specifically to train operator companies who ideally want to foresee failures before they occur to avoid significant financial costs. The methodology proposed is applicable for the predictive maintenance of many systems, not just railway diesel engines. © 2023 by the authors.",2-s2.0-85166171728
"FPGA implementation of a wireless sensor node with a built-in ADALINE neural network coprocessor for vibration analysis and fault diagnosis in machine condition monitoring Industry is a very attractive research field for wireless sensor network (WSN) applications. This is demonstrated by the creation of a special category of these networks dedicated to industrial applications, called industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSN). The sensor node, the main component of the network, must have several characteristics, such as a very high processing speed, reliable results, communication capabilities, and reduced transmission time. In this article, we outline the results of replacing the fast Fourier transform (FFT) processing of vibrational signals with an artificial adaptive linear element (ADALINE) neural network in order to extract the harmonics of the signals and thus detect faults in rotating machines. In addition, a MicroBlaze soft-core processor and an nRF24L01+ transmitter was chosen to manage various tasks within the node and the data exchange between the nodes of the network. A Digilent Cmod A7 platform with an Artix-7 FPGA circuit from Xilinx was selected to implement the different blocks that constitute the wireless node. Practical tests showed that the choice of the ADALINE enabled us to achieve the desired results by reducing the processing time to 7.478 ms, which is a reduction of time of approximately 85% compared to results obtained in scientific research. In addition, we have reduced the number of transmitted packets to only two. These results will have a positive impact on the performance of the node, with measurements using a periodic measurement methodology showing that the lifetime of the node can reach up to 17 h. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85085505734
"Fault Detection in Harmonic Drive Using Multi-Sensor Data Fusion and Gravitational Search Algorithm This study proposes a fault diagnosis method for harmonic drive systems based on multi-sensor data fusion and the gravitational search algorithm (GSA). As a critical component in robotic arms, harmonic drives are prone to failures due to wear, less grease, or improper loading, which can compromise system stability and production efficiency. To enhance diagnostic accuracy, the research employs wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to extract multi-scale features from vibration signals. These features are subsequently fused, and GSA is used to optimize the high-dimensional fused features, eliminating redundant data and mitigating overfitting. The optimized features are then input into a support vector machine (SVM) for fault classification, with K-fold cross-validation used to assess the model’s generalization capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed diagnosis method, which integrates multi-sensor data fusion with GSA optimization, significantly improves fault diagnosis accuracy compared to methods using single-sensor signals or unoptimized features. This improvement is particularly notable in multi-class fault scenarios. Additionally, GSA’s global search capability effectively addresses overfitting issues caused by high-dimensional data, resulting in a diagnostic model with greater reliability and accuracy across various fault conditions. © 2024 by the authors.",2-s2.0-85213245715
"Traffic Flow Anomaly Detection Based on Robust Ridge Regression with Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm Traffic flow anomaly detection is helpful to improve the efficiency and reliability of detecting fault behavior and the overall effectiveness of the traffic operation. The data detected by the traffic flow sensor contains a lot of noise due to equipment failure, environmental interference, and other factors. In the case of large traffic flow data noises, a traffic flow anomaly detection method based on robust ridge regression with particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed. Feature sets containing historical characteristics with a strong linear correlation and statistical characteristics using the optimal sliding window are constructed. Then by providing the feature sets inputs to the PSO-Huber-Ridge model and the model outputs the traffic flow. The Huber loss function is recommended to reduce noise interference in the traffic flow. The L2 regular term of the ridge regression is employed to reduce the degree of overfitting of the model training. A fitness function is constructed, which can balance the relative size between the k-fold cross-validation root mean square error and the k-fold cross-validation average absolute error with the control parameter η to improve the optimization efficiency of the optimization algorithm and the generalization ability of the proposed model. The hyperparameters of the robust ridge regression forecast model are optimized by the PSO algorithm to obtain the optimal hyperparameters. The traffic flow data set is used to train and validate the proposed model. Compared with other optimization methods, the proposed model has the lowest RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. Finally, the traffic flow that forecasted by the proposed model is used to perform anomaly detection. The abnormality of the error between the forecasted value and the actual value is detected by the abnormal traffic flow threshold based on the sliding window. The experimental results verify the validity of the proposed anomaly detection model.  © 2020 Mingzhu Tang et al.",2-s2.0-85093968112

"An adaptive data fusion strategy for fault diagnosis based on the convolutional neural network Intelligent diagnosis algorithms can monitor faults with industrial production of a timely manner via their powerful learning ability. Multi-sensor diagnosis systems can more comprehensively describe the state of equipment and avoid the influence of incorrect data acquisition locations, which is beneficial to fault diagnosis. The fusion of the original data is a difficult problem, and it is hard to express effective information via traditional algorithms. This paper presents an adaptive data fusion strategy based on deep learning called the convolutional neural network with atrous convolution for the adaptive fusion of multiple source data (FAC-CNN). Specifically, an adaptive-sized convolution kernel that matches the channel of data sources is constructed to capture multi-source data without tedious preprocessing, and the channel of data sources is not limited. The atrous convolution kernel is introduced to expand the field of view of the FAC-CNN and extracts fusion sequence features without repeated computation, resulting in improved stability. The 1D-CNN is added to extract features after atrous convolution. In addition, batch normalization optimizes the distribution of fusion data and the structure of the model. The parametric rectified linear unit activation function and global average pooling are also introduced to improve network performance. The proposed method is validated on an industrial fan system with non-manufacturing faults and a centrifugal pump. Compared with other fusion methods and diagnosis algorithms based on feature engineering, namely CNN, ANN, and SVM, the FAC-CNN model is found to exhibit superior performance. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85087278561

"Fault Diagnosis in a 2 MW Wind Turbine Drive Train by Vibration Analysis: A Case Study This paper presents a vibration analysis method for detecting typical faults in gears of the drive train of a 2 MW wind turbine. The data were collected over a one-year period from an operating wind turbine with a gearbox composed of one planetary stage and two helical gear stages. Failures in two pairs of helical gears were identified: one involving pitting and wear in the gears connecting the intermediate-speed shaft to the low-speed shaft, and another one involving significant material detachment in the gears connecting the intermediate-speed shaft to the high-speed shaft. The continuous evaluation of time signals, frequency spectra, and amplitude modulations allowed the most sensitive sensors and frequencies for predicting surface damage on gear teeth in this type of turbine to be determined. A steady-state frequency analysis was performed, enabling the detection of the aforementioned surface faults. This approach is simpler compared with more complex transient-state techniques. By tracking vibration signals over time, the importance of analyzing gear mesh frequencies and their harmonics was highlighted. Additionally, it was found that the progression of gear damage was dependent on the power output of the wind turbine. As a result, the most appropriate ranges of power were identified, within which the evolution of the vibration measurement was associated with the damage evolution.

"Data synthesis using dual discriminator conditional generative adversarial networks for imbalanced fault diagnosis of rolling bearings Diagnosis of rolling bearings plays an important role in condition monitoring of industrial rotating machinery. In many actual applications, rolling bearings work in normal state at most time and faulty samples are difficult to be collected. Thus, it is easy to arise problem of imbalanced dataset which restricts accuracy and stability of fault diagnosis. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been proved to be effective to produce artificial data that are alike real data, and have been widely used in image fields. Data synthesis using deep generative model provide a promising methodology for imbalanced fault diagnosis of machinery. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named dual discriminator conditional generative adversarial networks (D2CGANs) to learn from sensor signals on multimodal fault samples and automatically synthesize realistic one-dimensional signals of each fault. The framework is designed to produce realistic multimodal samples with fault labels and dual-discriminator structure is benefit to enhance the quality and diversity of synthesized data without mode collapse. Then, synthesized data can be used for data augmentation to improve the accuracy of imbalanced fault diagnosis. In order to evaluate the performance of the generative model, we introduce a set of assessments to evaluate quality and diversity of synthesized data, including quantitative statistical metrics and qualitative visualization. Finally, experiments on rolling bearings datasets from Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) are implemented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach for imbalanced fault diagnosis. Results demonstrate our method outperforms other widely used synthesis techniques in terms of data synthesis quality and fault diagnosis accuracy, and timeliness analysis also denotes our method can meet requirement of online fault diagnosis. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85082166599
"Current- and Vibration-Based Detection of Misalignment Faults in Synchronous Reluctance Motors Misalignment faults in drive systems occur when the motor and load are not properly aligned, leading to deviations in the centerlines of the coupled shafts. These faults can cause significant damage to bearings, shafts, and couplings, making early detection essential. Traditional diagnostic techniques rely on vibration monitoring, which provides insights into both mechanical and electromagnetic fault signatures. However, its main drawback is the need for external sensors, which may not be feasible in certain applications. Alternatively, motor current signature analysis (MCSA) has proven effective in detecting faults without requiring additional sensors. This study investigates misalignment faults in synchronous reluctance motors (SynRMs) by analyzing both vibration and current signals under different load conditions and operating speeds. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) is applied to extract characteristic frequency components linked to misalignment. Experimental results reveal that the amplitudes of rotational frequency harmonics ((Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), and (Formula presented.)) increase in the presence of misalignment, with (Formula presented.) exhibiting the most stable progression. Additionally, acceleration-based vibration analysis proves to be a more reliable diagnostic tool compared to velocity measurements. These findings highlight the potential of combining current and vibration analysis to enhance misalignment detection in SynRMs, improving predictive maintenance strategies in industrial applications. © 2025 by the authors.",2-s2.0-105003552671
"Optimizing Wireless Sensor Networks with Machine Learning-Based Predictive Maintenance Predictive Maintenance systems (PdMs) provide a modern approach for system operators to assess current conditions and predict future system performance, enabling timely maintenance actions. This model integrates quantization and encoding techniques to minimize complexity. Quantization refers to the process of reducing the number of bits used to represent data, while encoding transforms data into a suitable format for processing.

"Industrial Pumps Anomaly Detection and Semi-supervised Anomalies Labeling Through a Cascaded Clustering Approach Automation technology has brought significant changes to agriculture, industry, commerce and other fields, among which the machine learning algorithms are the important applications of predictive maintenance of industrial equipment. In general, anomalous trends should be detected timely before failure occurs so that unscheduled downtime can be avoided. In addition, predictive maintenance can avoid unnecessary maintenance and make good use of component remaining life by setting appropriate maintenance periods for worn parts. In this paper, based on the real case in which data collected by the various sensors on coal mine pumping system, we propose a cascaded unsupervised clustering method that consists of DBSCAN and spectral clustering to identify uncommon abnormal data and classify the common abnormal data. As equipment continuously operating, the proposed cascaded clustering method can gradually utilize the obtained uncommon abnormal data to enlarge the common abnormal data. This process implemented through periodic manually labeling is regarded as a semi-supervised manner. The results show that DBSCAN has good discriminative power for uncommon abnormal data, and the spectral clustering can properly classify working condition of water pumps with 93% accuracy on test data. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2-s2.0-85135907866
"Study on Electromagnetic–Dynamic Coupled Modeling Method—Detection by Stator Current of the Induction Motors with Bearing Faults Detecting motor bearing faults by stator currents is of great importance as it improves the adaptability of measurement means to different environments and reduces the number of sensors. Therefore, many studies have been conducted to investigate bearing faults by constructing motor models, most of which have used signal models to simulate the dynamics of the bearings. However, the signal model may be exposed to the issue that the nonlinearities in the bearing operation are neglected, thus oversimplifying the coupling effects between the electromagnetic and dynamics models. Hence, a coupled electromagnetic–dynamic modeling method for induction motors based on multiple coupled circuit theory and the rotor-bearing dynamics model is proposed in this study to implement the coupled simulation of electromagnetic and dynamic models. The air gap length and rotor velocity are used as coupled parameters for the calculation of stator–rotor mutual inductance and ball contact deformation, respectively. The simulation results show that the proposed model can effectively implement the electromagnetic–dynamic coupled and reflect the bearing fault characteristics in the current signal. Experiments were conducted on induction motors with typical winding configurations under laboratory conditions. The comparison results verify the effectiveness of the proposed modeling method. © 2022 by the authors.",2-s2.0-85137609808

"Data-Driven Fault Detection of AUV Rudder System: A Mixture Model Approach Based on data-driven and mixed models, this study proposes a fault detection method for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) rudder systems. The proposed method can effectively detect faults in the absence of angle feedback from the rudder.

"Multi-sensory Fault Diagnosis of Broken Rotor Bars Using Transfer Learning Induction motors play a crucial role in industrial operations, constituting a significant portion of the workforce. The occurrence of faults in these motors can substantially impact their operational performance. Approximately 20% of these faults stem from broken rotor bars, underscoring the importance of early detection to prevent more severe issues.

Early detection of equipment failures in industrial systems can greatly reduce scrap and financial losses. Developed sensor data acquisition technologies allow for digitally generating and storing many types of sensor data. Data-driven computational models allow the extraction of information about the machine’s state from acquired sensor data. The outstanding generalization capabilities of deep learning models have enabled them to play a significant role as a data-driven computational fault model in equipment condition monitoring.

"Anomaly Detection in Bearing Temperature Data of Industrial Centrifuge Device Using One-Class SVM for Predictive Maintenance in the Mining Sector This paper explores the application of sensor data analysis to detect anomalies in temperature measurements of bearings within an industrial centrifugal device used by a mining company. The primary focus of the study was to analyse abnormalities in the temperature data that could indicate potential equipment issues, employing the One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM) technique for this purpose. Anomaly detection plays a critical role in understanding the behaviour of operational data. It serves as a foundational element in the development of predictive maintenance systems, particularly those aimed at fault classification. In this study, temperature sensors attached to the bearings continuously monitored the device’s operational state, generating a substantial dataset over time. The One-Class SVM technique was applied to this data to identify any deviations from the normal operational patterns, which could signal the onset of mechanical issues or failures. By focusing on detecting these anomalies early, the study aimed to contribute to the creation of a more proactive approach to equipment maintenance, moving from reactive repairs to preventative strategies. The results of the analysis demonstrate that the One-Class SVM is highly effective at pinpointing anomalies, offering valuable insights that can be utilized for the ongoing monitoring and management of equipment health. These insights are instrumental in the proactive surveillance of equipment conditions, ultimately aiding in the development of intelligent maintenance strategies that can reduce downtime, enhance operational efficiency, and extend the lifespan of critical industrial machinery. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.",2-s2.0-105002712155

"Tool Remaining Useful Life Prediction Method Based on Multi-Sensor Fusion under Variable Working Conditions Under variable working conditions, the tool status signal is affected by changing machine processing parameters, resulting in a decreased prediction accuracy of the remaining useful life (RUL). Aiming at this problem, a method based on multi-sensor fusion for tool RUL prediction was proposed. Firstly, the factorization machine (FM) was used to extract the nonlinear processing features in the low-frequency condition signal, and the one-dimensional separable convolution was applied to extract tool life state features from multi-channel high-frequency sensor signals. Secondly, the residual attention mechanism was introduced to weight the low-frequency condition characteristics and high-frequency state characteristics, respectively. Finally, the features extracted in the low-frequency and high-frequency parts were input into the full connection layer to integrate working condition information and state information to suppress the influence of variable conditions and improve prediction accuracy.

"Fault Detection, Diagnostics, and Treatment in Automated Manufacturing Systems Using Internet of Things and Colored Petri Nets Internet of things (IoT) applications, which include environmental sensors and control of automated manufacturing systems (AMS), are growing at a rapid rate. In terms of hardware and software designs, communication protocols, and/or manufacturers, IoT devices can be extremely heterogeneous. Therefore, when these devices are interconnected to create a complicated system, it can be very difficult to detect and fix any failures. This paper proposes a new reliability design methodology using “colored resource-oriented Petri nets” (CROPNs) and IoT to identify significant reliability metrics in AMS, which can assist in accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and resulting automated repair to enhance the adaptability of IoT devices within complicated cyber-physical systems (CPSs). First, a CROPN is constructed to state “sufficient and necessary conditions” for the liveness of the CROPN under resource failures and deadlocks. Then, a “fault diagnosis and treatment” technique is presented, which combines the resulting network with IoT to guarantee the reliability of the CROPN. In addition, a GPenSIM tool is used to verify, validate, and analyze the reliability of the IoT-based CROPN. Comparing the results to those found in the literature shows that they are structurally simpler and more effective in solving the deadlock issue and modeling AMS reliability. © 2023 by the authors.",2-s2.0-85149000999
"Data driven approach for estimation of remaining useful life of gearbox in wind energy conversion systems Wind energy represents a promising renewable resource; yet, its operational and maintenance expenses pose significant challenges, particularly in offshore facilities. Proactive problem detection and predictive maintenance procedures are essential to enhance the reliability and cost-effectiveness of wind turbine systems. This research introduces a data-driven prognostic approach for forecasting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of wind turbine gearboxes, characterized by few failures but significant downtime and repair intricacy. The technology combines vibration and oil temperature data to develop robust health indicators through time-domain feature extraction and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The Exponential Degradation Model is utilized for Remaining Useful Life estimation because of its appropriateness for systems demonstrating slow, monotonic deterioration. The assessment of performance by conventional measurements reveals significant predictive capacity, especially in the context of late-stage deterioration. Vibration data provides marginally superior predictive accuracy relative to oil temperature owing to its enhanced sensitivity to mechanical deterioration. The suggested methodology can accommodate real-world noise and sensor constraints.

"Adaptive Band Extraction Based on Low Rank Approximated Nonnegative Tucker Decomposition for Anti-Friction Bearing Faults Diagnosis Using Measured Vibration Data Condition monitoring and fault diagnosis are topics of growing interest for improving the reliability of modern industrial systems. As critical structural components, anti-friction bearings often operate under harsh conditions and are contributing factors of system failures. Efforts have been cast on bearing diagnostics under the sensor fusion and machine learning framework, whilst challenges remain open on the identification of incipient faults. In this paper, exploiting multi-way representations and decompositions of measured vibration data, a novel band separation method based on the factorization of spectrogram tensors using the low rank approximated nonnegative Tucker decomposition (LRANTD) is proposed and applied to identify detailed fault signatures from the spectral, temporal, and spatial dimensions, flexible for extracting multi-sensor features and multi-dimensional correlations. With the proposed method, informative frequency bands of the latent vibrational components can be automatically extracted, in accordance with the inherent temporal patterns that can be conveniently fed for spectral analysis and fault discrimination. Furthermore, an improved cross-spectrum can be calculated from multi-channel vibrations via LRANTD with enhanced fault features. Based on the real-world vibration data of the accelerated bearing life tests, detailed experimental studies and thorough comparisons to the conventional benchmarks have verified the effectiveness of the reported diagnostic methodology.

"Stand-Up Indulgent Gathering on Lines for Myopic Luminous Robots We consider a strong variant of the crash fault-tolerant gathering problem called stand-up indulgent gathering (SUIG), by robots endowed with limited visibility sensors and lights on line-shaped networks. In this problem, a group of mobile robots must eventually gather at a single location, not known beforehand, regardless of the occurrence of crashes. Differently from previous work that considered unlimited visibility, we assume that robots can observe nodes only within a certain fixed distance (that is, they are myopic), and emit a visible color from a fixed set (that is, they are luminous), without multiplicity detection. We consider algorithms depending on two parameters related to the initial configuration: Minit, which denotes the number of nodes between two border nodes, and Oinit, which denotes the number of nodes hosting robots. Then, a border node is a node hosting one or more robots that cannot see other robots on at least one side.

"Studying Induction Motor Load Asymmetry Influence Through MCSA Method Fault detection is very important in all types of systems. Systems’ operation monitoring allows maintenance planning and thereby reducing costs and losses. Because electrical motors are important parts of systems it is very useful to know and detect all types of failures. The paper presents the importance of electrical motor fault detection; and different technics used for its detection. These faults can appear during induction motor running and influence the whole system function and vibration. The normal functioning of the electrical motor can be influenced by several noises, which can be internal and/or external. In case of any fault the power consumption increases, the absorbed current spectrum is deformed, more heat is generated and vibrations are growing. There are several faults detection techniques, motor current signature analysis, vibration analysis, current and voltage harmonics analysis, etc. MCSA is a non-invasive method, which does not use sensors, but it monitors and analyses the stator current. Different faults lead to the appearance of different harmonics in the stator current spectrum. The paper presents how the faults distort the motor current spectrum and what faults can be detected. A measuring system is presented for monitoring the condition of the induction motor and to detect load torque asymmetry. The motor stator current spectrum is analysed in case of load torque asymmetry. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",2-s2.0-85190667899
"Digital Twin-Based Fuel Consumption Model of Locomotive Diesel Engine In this study, we developed a digital twin (DT) model of a diesel engine in TÜLOMSAŞ. We estimated the fuel consumption of the engine using the designed DT model. For this purpose, we first created the physical model of fuel consumption. We measured the parameters of the physical model that can be measured directly or other parameters related to these parameters through sensors attached to the engine. We demonstrated that all the parameters of the physical model are essentially interrelated by examining the correlations between the observed data and fuel consumption. Using the measured data for fuel consumption, air consumption, rpm, and combustion temperature, we created two Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with a single hidden layer and a double hidden layer. By analyzing the results of the models, we created, we showed that the ANN with a single hidden layer gave more accurate results in predicting fuel consumption. This model has an error rate of 2.3% and estimates fuel consumption with an average error of 7.34 L. The created DT is a model that can help in many aspects of planning, such as trip scheduling and preventive maintenance. Using this model, the ideal driving speed between stations can be calculated and train services can be scheduled to minimize fuel consumption. The remaining useful life can be calculated by studying the fuel consumption behavior, and fault detection can be performed in accordance with the fuel consumption pattern. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85173563321

"A novel approach for remaining useful life (RUL) assessment of an IOT-based intelligent weight data communication system The growing trend for adaptation of the Industry 4.0 concept has inspired different manufacturing sectors to include different intelligent machinery in their production and allied systems for sustainability improvement. IoT is a trending system, presently used in the different domains of the manufacturing sector and acts as a subset of intelligent machines. Thus, A minor fault in the system might be responsible for losing different resources. To overcome such circumstances, fault diagnosis is required for the said system. Parallelly, failure prognosis is also essential for the prediction of the future condition of the system. The root causes of system failure have been identified for both diagnosis and prognosis. The knowledge of system configuration is essential to identify the root cause of failure. Fault tree analysis (FTA) is a potential tool, that has been used to identify probable failures of the system. Sufficient data regarding the failure of the system components or Basic events (BE) have to be known in this regard. Hence, Fermatean-Fuzzy FTA (FFFTA) was conducted using experts’ elicitation to estimate the failure probability (FP) of the basic events (BEs) in the absence of requisite failure data. The FP over the different periods has been evaluated through this analysis. Based on the FP of the BEs, the effect of each event on system health has been evaluated in the form of posterior probability using the Bayesian network (BN). Lastly, a suitable prognostic model has been utilized for the Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of the critical BEs, which has been selected based on posterior probability. An IoT-Based Intelligent weight data communication system has been considered as a case study in this work. The Auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model has been chosen for RUL prediction. The Pareto principle has also been found supportive for the said system. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Society for Reliability and Safety (SRESA) 2025.",2-s2.0-105010656996

"Real-Time Neural Classifiers for Sensor and Actuator Faults in Three-Phase Induction Motors The main steps involved in a fault-tolerant control (FTC) scheme are the detection of failures, isolation and reconfiguration of control. Fault detection and isolation (FDI) is a topic of interest due to its importance for the controller, since it provides the necessary information to adjust and mitigate the effects of the fault. Generally, the most common failures occur in the actuator or in sensors, so this article proposes a novel model-free scheme for the detection and isolation of sensor and actuator faults of induction motors (IM). The proposed methodology performs the task of detecting and isolating faults over data streams just after the occurrence of the failure of an induction motor (IM), by the occurrence of either disconnection, degradation, failure, or connection damage. Our approach proposes deep neural networks that do not need a nominal model or generate residuals for fault detection, which makes it a useful tool. In addition, the fault-isolation approach is carried out by classifiers that differentiate characteristics independently of the other classifiers. The long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network, bidirectional LSTM, multilayer perceptron and convolutional neural network are used for this task. The proposed sensors’ and actuator’s fault detection and isolation scheme is simple. It can be applied to various problems involving fault detection and isolation schemes.

However, electrical rotating machines like the Induction Motor (IM) are still widely used in several industrial applications because of their robust elements, high efficiency, and versatility in industrial applications. Nevertheless, the occurrence of faults in IMs is inherent to their operating conditions; hence, Inter-turn short-circuit (ITSC) is one of the most common failures that affect IMs, and its appearance is due to electrical stresses leading to the degradation of the stator winding insulation. In this regard, this work proposes a diagnosis methodology capable of performing the assessment and automatic detection of incipient electric faults like ITSC in IMs; the proposed method is supported through the processing of different physical magnitudes such as vibration, stator currents and magnetic stray-flux and their fusion of information. Certainly, the novelty and contribution include the characterization of different physical magnitudes by estimating a set of statistical time domain features, as well as their fusion following a feature-level fusion approach and their reduction through the Linear discriminant Analysis technique. Furthermore, the fusion and reduction of information from different physical magnitudes lead to performing automatic fault detection and identification by a simple Neural-Network (NN) structure since all considered conditions can be represented in a 2D plane.

However, currently adopted anomaly detection methods are often affected by limitations such as the inability to analyze large-scale data, a reduced effectiveness when data presents multiple densities, a strong dependence on user-defined threshold configurations, and a lack of explainability in the extracted predictions. In this paper, we propose a distributed deep learning method that extends growing hierarchical self-organizing maps, originally designed for clustering tasks, to address anomaly detection tasks. The SOM-based modeling capabilities of the method enable the analysis of data with multiple densities, by exploiting multiple SOMs organized as a hierarchy. Our map-reduce implementation under Apache Spark allows the method to process and analyze large-scale sensor network data. An automatic threshold-tuning strategy reduces user efforts and increases the robustness of the method with respect to noisy instances. Moreover, an explainability component resorting to instance-based feature ranking emphasizes the most salient features influencing the decisions of the anomaly detection model, supporting users in their understanding of raised alerts. Experiments are conducted on five real-world sensor network datasets, including wind and photovoltaic energy production, vehicular traffic, and pedestrian flows. Our results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection competitors. Furthermore, a scalability analysis reveals that the method is able to scale linearly as the data volume presented increases, leveraging multiple worker nodes in a distributed computing setting. Qualitative analyses on the level of anomalous pollen in the air further emphasize the effectiveness of our proposed method, and its potential in determining the level of danger in raised alerts. © The Author(s) 2024.",2-s2.0-85182827538

"Model-Free Adaptive Fault-Tolerant Control for Offshore Wind Turbines Floating offshore wind turbines have increased in popularity owing to their adaptability for deep water applications and high power generation efficiency. The control of floating offshore wind turbines, on the other hand, is very complex. The main challenges are the difficulty in precisely modeling floating offshore wind turbines and the higher failure rate of components. As a consequence, this study proposes a model-free adaptive fault-tolerant control system for blade root moment sensor failures. A model-free adaptive control approach is used to construct an individual pitch controller and a fault compensation to avoid mathematical modeling of floating offshore wind turbines. The proposed fault-tolerant control technique removes the need for fault detection and isolation by converting the fault dynamic compensation process into a real-time control issue for nonlinear systems. The fatigue, aerodynamics, structures, and turbulence code simulates and tests the proposed control strategy, and the results show that the proposed strategy can not only keep the wheel bearing load balanced, but also reduce the movement of the floating platform and significantly reduce the bearing load of the floating offshore wind turbines. Furthermore, the output power is closer to the rated power, proving the strategy’s high fault tolerance in the face of repeated blade root moment sensor faults. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",2-s2.0-85198483915

"Fault Tolerant Control of Quadrotor Based on Sensor Fault Diagnosis and Recovery Information Drones have been developed for more than two decades. They have become central to the functions of various civil aviation and military services. Commercial usage of drones continues to grow steadily. As the drones have been used widely in different areas, this raises a safety concern, i.e., all the multi-rotors have an increased risk of motor or sensor faults. This paper considers a fault-tolerant control (FTC) problem against the inertial motion unit (IMU) sensor fault. First, a neural network estimator is built for the purpose of fault diagnosis. Second, a fault detection scheme is designed by comparing the IMU reading with the estimator, where it uses a logic rule to monitor the IMU state. Third, if the IMU sensor is in faulty state, the Euler angle estimator with neural network built is used to recover the IMU information which is fed into the controller designed.

"Driving Sustainable Development Goals: Ensemble Classification for Efficient Industrial Machinery Predictive Maintenance Predictive maintenance, which leverages historical and real-time data to anticipate equipment failures, is pivotal in enhancing safety, reducing costs, extending machinery lifespan, and minimizing downtime across industries such as energy, transportation, and manufacturing. This approach uses sensors to track important parameters like pressure, vibration, and temperature. Machine learning and advanced data analysis are then used to analyze the data and predict failures. Through the optimization of maintenance schedules, the removal of unnecessary tasks, and the calculation of machinery’s remaining useful life, this proactive method enables maintenance staff to handle possible problems before they develop into expensive failures. Traditional classification methods typically rely on a single model’s predictions. However, ensemble classification amalgamates predictions from multiple models, harnessing various perspectives to enhance adaptability and accuracy. This study delves into the application of ensemble methods—including Gradient Boosting (GB), CatBoost Classifier, and Random Forest for the predictive maintenance of industrial machinery. Each ensemble technique is meticulously evaluated in diverse industrial contexts, with an emphasis on how varying hyperparameters influence model performance. The study proposes a method for optimizing results through parameter adjustment. By boosting efficiency and reliability, promoting innovation via IoT and AI integration, and ensuring infrastructure sustainability, predictive maintenance aligns with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 9. It also supports SDG 12 by maximizing resource utilization, reducing waste and environmental impact, promoting sustainable production, and cutting energy consumption and emissions. Additionally, by lowering carbon emissions, mitigating environmental risks, and extending machinery lifespan to reduce frequent replacements, it contributes to SDG 13.

"Predictive Model for Agriculture Using Markov Model With upcoming technologies in farming and new varieties of seeds, it is a new challenge to adopt new ways of farming with changing climate conditions. So IoT gives us a new way to evolve with upcoming challenges. Production of crops is always influenced by the weather conditions; climate change has drastically changed the scenario. In new generation, new seed is evolved to get better yield, but they come with their own climate and water requirements. So in this work, we have tried to train the machine with the life cycle of the crop and make suggestion to the farmer with automated maintenance to maintain the environmental requirement of the crop at various stages of life cycle of the crop. The highlighting feature of this smart farming project is to maintain and meet the dynamic requirement of the crop and maintain the environmental condition based on the life cycle of the crop rather than making static threshold-based system. The farmer can check for new suggestions based on the growth of the crop which is directly proportional to the condition and height of the crop.

"Predictive Maintenance Model Using Hybrid Procedure of Improved Quantum Cat Swarm Optimisation for Asset Management in Industry 4.0 Contemporary manufacturing system design centres on the Industry 4.0 paradigm. A versatile platform secondary the efficient optimisation of manufacturing-related activities, such as predictive keep, is necessary for the successful mixing of cutting-edge technologies like the (IoT), cyber-physical schemes, computing. Predictive maintenance research that already exists often either develops a model without taking maintenance decisions into account or seeks to optimise maintenance in the light of the degradation replicas of the already-known scheme. With the use of predictive maintenance, a company's owner can make decisions like fixing or replacing a failing part of the manufacturing line before it actually fails. Because of this, Industry 4.0 necessitates efficient asset management in order to maximise the distribution of duties and the accuracy of predictive maintenance models. To address the issue of predictive maintenance in fog computing, this paper proposes an enhanced version of the quantum cat swarm optimisation (QCSO) algorithm by combining the quantum bit (Q-bit) and the cat swarm procedure (CSO) and updating the cats based on the quantum rotation angle site. Finally, the (MR) worth is chosen based on the sum of times the procedure is run. FogWorkflowsim uses simulated real-time datasets to evaluate the forecasting performance of QCSO and other existing models. The outcomes prove that the projected method is superior to the currently used predictive maintenance resource allocation methods.

"Early detection of lithium battery leakage using a highly sensitive in situ ZIF-8 membrane-coated micro-nano optical fibre Detecting electrolyte leakage is an effective early warning approach for abnormal faults in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and can help mitigate safety risks such as fires and explosions. However, detecting electrolyte leakage in the early stages of LIB faults presents a significant challenge, as leaks in LIBs produce volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at parts per million levels that are difficult to detect using conventional VOC sensors. Here, an effective LIB VOC sensor using micro-nano optical fibres (MNFs) has been developed for the first time, coated with an in situ self-assembled zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) membrane as an electrolyte-sensitive layer. The abundance of pores in ZIF-8 is excellent for adsorbing a variety of VOCs, including diethyl carbonate, ethyl methyl carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, and propylene carbonate. The MNFs possess high refractive index sensitivity, enhancing the online monitoring of electrolytes. MNFs with a diameter of approximately 7 μm were assembled with four-cycle ZIF-8 of approximately 500 nm thickness, as the fabricated sensor. Through wavelength demodulation, the LIB sensor demonstrated high sensitivity, detecting 43.6 pm/ppm of VOCs and exhibiting rapid response and recovery times of typically within 10 min and 23 s, respectively, as well as a low theoretical detection limit of 2.65 ppm for dimethyl carbonate vapor with excellent reversibility. The first on-site verification of online LIB leakage monitoring demonstrated that the sensor achieved a 35 h early warning prior to full-load leakage, thus exhibiting promising prospects for applications in scenarios such as car batteries. © The Author(s) 2025.",2-s2.0-105002130331

"PCA Based Energy Network Temporal and Spatial Data Analysis and Prediction Nowadays, intelligent energy networks are rising with the development of Internet of Things. Relying on massive quantity of sensors, digital twin technology makes it possible to monitor the condition of an energy network in real time. However, for decision makers, future condition is more valuable. Common types of energy like cooling, heating and electrical power, are difficult to be stored. So, the production and consumption of energy shall be in a balance. The prediction of energy consumption helps to reduce cost and waste. Furthermore, the prediction equipment condition can support scheduling and maintenance. As a result, accurate and efficient condition prediction is strongly required in novel energy network. To solve the problem, a principle components analysis (PCA) based temporal and spatial view analysis and prediction (PTSVP) model is proposed in this paper. Because of the considerable amount of data in energy network, data analysis is difficult and inefficient. Dimension reduction can help to reduce data model complexity and lead to efficient prediction. Thanks to the linear dependency among network record, we use feature exaction technology to reduce dimension of energy network data. Besides, traditional prediction model tends to ignore the spatial relations among data.

"Fault Detection Engine for Big Data Analytics and Its Applications Due to their reliance on several distributed nodes, big data systems are notoriously fragile. Maintaining availability, reliability, and continuous performance in the face of failures is the primary function of fault-tolerant systems. Fault prediction is an important subject for industry because it enables businesses to make major time and expense savings by offering efficient methods for predictive maintenance. To that end, there were two objectives: first to develop prediction techniques that would detect failures in doors from diagnostic data at an early stage; and second, to describe failures in terms of characteristics that differentiate them from normal behaviour. Some elements of the solution suggested merit special consideration. They provide the foundation for an efficient data pre-processing technique in which the action of a system is described in a specific timeframe by a set of appropriate statistics. This method significantly mitigates problems relating to data noise and errors, allowing an efficient outer detection. In our opinion, all of this is the basis of a general approach for advanced prognostic systems. In no default scenarios, so whether the percentage goes up or down, the outcome of the percentage is consistent with the rational regression percentage curve. The defect can be detected with a visualized data representation and with the percentage variation. We notice that ignition timer cylinders 2 and 3 in time interval 20–23 are not read in conformity with the sample regression form, and that the other sensors read on the graph intersect in calculation to get better accuracy. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023.",2-s2.0-85174440608
"Are Human Drivers a Liability or an Asset? This paper investigates the relationship between near misses and human error that leads to a collision. A Smart wheelchair that can detect obstacles is used as an example. Many collisions are the fault of the driver and could be avoided if a sensor system was allowed more control of the vehicle. Some claim that eliminating a human driver from a control loop could eliminate collisions caused by human error. Others caution that human error may not disappear completely with the elimination of the driver and that new incidents may occur because of it. Analysis suggests that a human driver is attributable to many errors but that at the same time a human is vital for avoiding many accidents. The volume of near misses in this analysis is of a sufficient quantity to make some generalized conclusions about the nature of the detection and mitigation of collisions. It would strengthen the analysis if near misses from other types of driving were available. Near misses are a source of information about potential collisions as if a person is having more near misses then they may be becoming tired or distracted. Near misses were analyzed in order to examine what role on-board human drivers play in the occurrence and detection of the initial stages of a collision. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85113225064

The automated machine learning seems to be the area dealing with this challenge. In this paper, we first show the problematic of assisting industry 4.0 actors to implement ML algorithms in the context of predictive maintenance. We then present a novel AutoML based framework. It aims to enable industry 4.0 actors and researchers, who presumably have limited competencies in machine learning, to generate ML-based data analytics solutions and their deployment in the manufacturing workflows. The framework implements primarily the approaches based on the meta-learning for this purpose. In the context of Industry 4.0 such approaches lead to the implementation of the smart factory concepts. It makes the factory processes more proactive on the basis of predictive knowledge extracted from the various manufacturing devices, sensors, and business processes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85135011463
"Model-Free Neural Fault-Tolerant Control for Discrete-Time Unknown Nonlinear Systems This paper presents the design of a new fault-tolerant control methodology based on a model-free neural technique. For an unknown nonlinear dynamical system, a recurrent neural network is proposed to design an on-line identifier to develop an adaptive mathematical model that captures the dynamics of the system using only available measurements of its state variables. Employing this neural model, the use of a discrete sliding mode controller is proposed, which is modified to adequately handle the presence of faults in the sensors and actuators, as well as disturbances and uncertainties that occur during the operation of the system. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is shown by means of simulation results for a three-phase induction motor. Most of the fault-tolerant controllers start from a nominal model of the system to be controlled, from that neural model methodologies are established that evaluate the behavior of the system with respect to a nominal model, originating a residue between such signals. This residue is analyzed using traditional techniques or artificial intelligence, for which the success of this type of methodology lies in how well the behavior of the system is captured in its mathematical model. Therefore, the main contribution of this methodology is that the proposed controller is model-free, the detection of the fault and the corresponding modification to the control is carried out directly from the measured data, nor does it require exact knowledge of the faults, their duration, or the time they occur, everything is computed implicitly through the neural network. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85152561489
"Distributed traversal based fault diagnosis for wireless sensor network Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have become a new information collection and monitoring solution for the various application. Faults occurring to sensor nodes are prevalent due to the sensor device itself and the harsh environment, where the sensor nodes are deployed. To ensure the quality of service and to avoid further degradation of service, it is necessary for the WSN to be able to tolerant of the faulty nodes present in the network. The fault diagnosis techniques are classified based on the methods they employ to determine the faults. In this paper, we have proposed a traversal-based diagnosis algorithm that seeks to diagnose both permanent as well as intermittent fault in WSN. The proposed algorithm employs a special node called an anchor node to traverse the field. The traversal of the field is decided by a proposed traversal algorithm taking into consideration the length and breadth of the sensor field, and the transmission range of the nodes. The anchor node stops at defined positions in the deployment field where it executes the fault diagnosis algorithm taking into consideration the normal sensor nodes which are in its range. The diagnosis algorithm uses a timeout mechanism to identify hard faults and adjusted boxplot method to identify permanent and intermittent faults in the network. The adjusted boxplot method takes into consideration the skewness of the data generated by the nodes in the sensor field. The faulty sensor nodes are classified by using a Feed Forward Neural Net (FFNN) model with Gravitational Search (GS) learning algorithm. The proposed algorithm is implemented in the Omnet++ environment which shows very promising results. The performance parameters, such as detection accuracy, false alarm rate, false positive rate, and energy consumption of the proposed algorithm show significant improvement over the existing algorithms. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.",2-s2.0-85105070954
"Artificial Intelligence for Predictive Maintenance of Port Equipment: A Revolution in Progress Artificial Intelligence (AI) is playing a crucial role in enhancing predictive maintenance for port handling equipment. By continuously collecting data, sophisticated algorithms, and machine learning capabilities, AI enables ports to accurately anticipate the maintenance needs of their equipment, thereby reducing unplanned downtime and costs. The significance of AI in this con-text lies in its ability to analyze vast amounts of data from sensors and monitoring systems of port equipment. Through this analysis, predictive models can identify trends, patterns, and early signs of failure, allowing port opera-tors to proactively plan maintenance. This not only improves the safety of port operations but also maximizes operational efficiency by avoiding unexpected disruptions. Furthermore, AI also extends the equipment's lifespan by optimizing its usage and identifying parts requiring maintenance or replacement. Ultimately, this results in significant cost reducing and better resource management. In this matter, we were interested in using predictive maintenance by handling the unexpected downtimes of port equipment. This is achieved by predicting potential failure of equipment. The goal behind predictive maintenance is mainly to enhance safety, decrease costs, and making port industry more automated and intelligent. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",2-s2.0-85203162778
"Field vibrational analysis of a full scale horizontal-axis wind turbine in actual operating conditions Wind farm operation reliability is becoming a key asset for wind energy conversion systems in the framework of grid-parity energy market. Consequently, experimental methods for characterizing the vibration behaviour of wind turbines in real operating conditions are going to play a fundamental role in order to improve the correct estimation of the RUL (Remaining Useful Life) of the components as well as the whole system. For this reason, in the present work a new experimental approach for the identification of the most important mechanical parameters through field acceleration measurements has been developed and tested on a full scale three bladed wind turbine with a rated power of 200 kW and a rotor diameter of 31 m. The main goal of the identification procedure was to give the correct estimation of important vibration parameters of the structure and the machine. As for example the tower structural eigenfrequencies and the structural damping. The experimental setup included three accelerometers on the nacelle (two for the tower and one for the main bearing) and up to four sensors on along the tower and in the foundation. The structural eigeinfrenquencies have been studied through machine emergency stops while the operational condition were studied capturing steady-state events. The study demonstrates that the experimental data post-processing can represent a fruitful and quick approach for defining the most important structural and dynamic parameter even when the full details of the wind turbine are not available and this can be particularly useful for refurbished technology. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",2-s2.0-85083971279
"Implementation of Underground Cable Fault Detection Using IoT Overhead lines and power cables are used to transmit and distribute power. Although overhead lines have been the most reliable, decentralization of the power sector and growing environmental concerns increase the need for underground cable-based electric power systems. Despite the fact that there are numerous protection measures for high-voltage cable systems, this paper focuses on voltage monitoring and detection of faults in Medium voltage (MV) or High voltage (HV) underground cables. The proposed system identifies the major problems in the underground cable such as open circuit faults, short circuit faults, and the location of the fault at a specific distance. A prototype model is developed for a 40 cm cable with three fault positions. The switch is used to create the open circuit fault in the prototype model and when phase and neutral wire touches each other it will create short circuit fault. The system uses an embedded system based on the master–slave concept. The sensor network serves as a slave to a PIC16F877A microcontroller. The i2c protocol is used to implement master and slave communication. The Wi-Fi module is used in IoT to display information via the Internet.

"Feature Assessment for a Hybrid Model This paper proposes an assessment of features orientated to improve the accuracy of a hybrid model (HyM) used for detecting faults in a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system. The HyM combines data collected by sensors embedded in the system with data generated by a physics-based model of the HVAC. The physics-based model includes sensors embedded in the real system and virtual sensors to represent the behaviour of the system when a failure mode (FM) is simulated. This fusion leads to improved maintenance actions to reduce the number of failures and predict the behaviour of the system. HyM can lead to improved fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) processes of critical systems, but multiple fault detection models are sometimes inaccurate. The paper assesses features extracted from synthetic signals. The results of the assessment are used to improve the accuracy of a multiple fault detection model developed in previous research. The assessment of features comprises the following: (1) generation of run-to-failure data using the physics-based model of the HVAC system; the FMs simulated in this paper are dust in the air filter, degradation of the CO2 sensor, degradation of the evaporator fan, and variations in the compression rate of the cooling system; (2) identification of the individual features that strongly distinguish the FM; (3) analysis of how the features selected vary when components degrade. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2-s2.0-85172243752
"Creating Value and Business Benefits from Joint Offerings of Asset Performance Management Tools in the Capital-Intensive Industries In capital intensive industries, the purchasing of IoT, predictive maintenance or other digital solutions is very complex as there already exists several separate legacy systems. Also for a single solution provider, the customer needs and expectations can be huge, and they might not have all resources or competences needed for the delivery. In our research, we examined various aspects related to joint offering development and value creation. We define the joint offering as a concept or solution that is co-created in collaboration with two or more actors that usually have complementary technological skills or value creation logics. Based on our study, there is still relatively little joint offerings deployed supporting asset performance management and execution of asset management operations. To discover the interaction between the actors able to provide a joint-solution, we further sketched value network models from the anonymised industrial challenges. Finally, the developed conceptual framework clarifies the scene of both the business opportunities and value assessment. The first part of the framework, business opportunities, considers the business models, value networks and analysis of business opportunities and risks. The later part, business value assessment, is built on capital and operating expenditure and revenues summarising the business value. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85127665106

"Study and analysis of various load balancing techniques for software-defined network (A systematic survey) The interconnections between persons, organizations and various entities are possible only because of information communication technology (ICT). ICT changes the era into digital world. In this digital world, all things are possibly connected to each other through ICT and makes possible the concept of Internet of things (IoT). To implement these concepts, the computer network plays a vital role. But, the traditional IP network is difficult to manage, complex and rigid to configure the network according to the change of the organization’s policies. The traditional computer network is also difficult to handle the fault, load and changes because the data plane and control plane are integrated. Therefore, the idea of software-defined networking (SDN) Fei et al. (IEEE Commun Surv Tutor 16(4):2181–2206, 2014, [1]) is a flourishing field to solve the issues of traditional computer network. SDN vows to change the traditional network by segmenting the planes of networking into two separate planes as data plane and control plane. SDN makes it simpler to create and present abstraction and simplifying in networking. There are different functionalities provided by the SDN, for example, traffic engineering, load balancing, routing, intrusion detection, security and so on. Load balancing is one of them. This paper is analyzing the concept and evolution of SDN and further emphasis on the concept of load balancing. Further, analysis and comparison of various load balancing techniques are also given in this text.

"Generation of a Tachometer Signal from a Smart Vibration Sensor Because of the bandwidth limitation of the engine controller, all helicopter gearboxes change speed over time. This change in speed necessitates the resampling of the data, based on a tachometer signal, to facilitate shaft, gear and bearing analysis of the rotating equipment. Without resampling, the quality of vibration analysis is degraded, and many mechanical faults would be missed. Further, interfacing with existing tachometer can be both expensive, and in some cases change certification requirements. The ability for a smart sensor to acquire vibration data, extract the shaft speed from the vibration data, and then process the data allows vibration-based fault detection capability at a lower cost, weight and reduced installation complexity than previously possible. Reducing cost, weight and installation complexity will expand the business case for condition monitoring, improving safety and reliability in industrial and transportation systems. This paper demonstrates a two-step process to recover a tachometer signal from vibration data that is of higher quality than raw tachometer data. Statistics are generated from known fault cases to demonstrate the effectiveness. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85093890172
"Applying Time-Constraints Using Ontologies to Sensor Data for Predictive Maintenance Predictive maintenance depends on sources of data analysed through machine learning and data mining algorithms to identify and predict potential fault states. However, sources of raw data lack a layer of semantic abstraction providing a consistent way of interpreting data. The use of ontologies to describe data from structured and unstructured sources has been employed to provide a semantic layer delivering a consistent interpretation and meaning to data that can be exchanged between different entities. Data supplied by sensors is time-sensitive, as variations and fluctuations occur over periods and must be analysed regarding the period they occur. Transforming raw data and applying time constraints to fit the data to the semantic concepts is a process not frequently documented. In this paper, we present an architecture for the transformation of data acquired through different sources – from sensors to contextual information supplied by management software – from JSON to ontology instances that can be used in a predictive maintenance scenario, alongside with machine learning and data mining solutions. Here, the different data sources are transformed semantic time-sensitive data, represented through means of an ontology and stored in a triple store. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85131125560

"Experimental Validation of the Blade Excitation in a Shaft Vibration Signals Monitoring of blade vibrations is an important part in the maintenance of the rotating machine and its proper operation. The signal analysis of blade vibration plays an important role in detection of blade structure change. Early detection can avoid unnecessary losses. This is important especially for blades in the last stage of low-pressure turbine. The popular method used for blade vibration monitoring is blade-tip timing, which is not installed standardly yet due to the higher installation costs. An alternative method for blade vibration monitoring is based on relative shaft vibration signal analysis. This signal is measured by standardly installed instrumentation thus any additional sensor installation is not necessary. Recently, a few papers were published showing that rotor oscillations contain the information about the blade vibrations. However, the principle of the blade oscillations transition into the shaft vibrations was not described in detail so far. Explanation of main principle of rotor excitation by rotating blades is described in this paper. The described theory is experimentally validated using a machinery fault simulator. The experiment was based on the excitation of the forced blade vibrations by the piezo elements installed on the bladed disc, which was mounted on the simulator shaft. Excitation of piezo elements was set in an appropriate form to be able to clarify the principle and validate theory which was described in this paper. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2-s2.0-85102653756

"Machine History Based Data Learning in CNC Machining With the recent development of the machine tool industry, there is an increasing trend of research to collect real-time cutting physics data in CNC cutting and control the CNC. Cutting physics data is the information collected by various sensors such as current, acceleration, voltage, and torque sensors, which indirectly measure the cutting load. This cutting physics data is used for tool condition diagnosis, cutting condition control, and as a key evaluation indicator for predictive maintenance of the spindle. However, in cutting processes, cutting physics data is less useful due to various factors such as machine, workpiece, tool, cutting conditions, and coolant. For more precise machining condition diagnosis or control, a data learning process using the collected cutting physics data is required. In this study, we present a method for storing machining history data that synchronises CNC data and cutting physics data, and data learning using the data. Data learning methods based on machining history data include (1) optimising NC data to improve productivity by controlling the feed rate, (2) learning data separated by tool unit to manage the life of individual tools or diagnose the degree of wear, and (3) generating reference control curves for real-time feed rate control during machining.

"Application of Autoencoder for Control Valve Predictive Analytics In this paper, we investigated the application of an autoencoder neural network for predictive analytics of control valves, which are crucial components in industrial processes with significant consequences in case of failure. The autoencoder was created using Python and Keras deep learning framework, comprising encoding and decoding sections. By comparing the difference between the input sensor data and its reconstructed output, referred to as the reconstruction error, we were able to identify anomalies. The result which is based on the data of an actual asset was compared with the random forest regressor to ensure the effectiveness of the approach. We have also proposed a practical approach to generate alerts when the magnitude exceeds a predefined threshold, thereby enabling proactive maintenance and avoiding unplanned shutdowns. We emphasized the diagnostic capability of the autoencoder in identifying anomalous sensors, which is not present in traditional regression approaches. Furthermore, we argued that this capability could be more valuable for a complex equipment with many input sensors.

"Industry 4.0: Why Machine Learning Matters? Machine Learning is at the forefront of the Industry 4.0 revolution. Both the amount and complexity of data generated by sensors make interpretation and ingestion of data beyond human capability. It is impossible for engineers to optimise an extremely complex production line and to understand which unit or machine is responsible for quality or productivity degradation! It is extremely difficult for engineers to process monitoring or inspection data as it requires a protocol, a trained and certified engineer as well as experience! It is extremely difficult to guarantee the quality of every single product particularly at high production rates! Artificial Intelligence can help answering the above questions. Indeed, machine learning can be used for predictive or condition-based maintenance. Even without knowing the design of the machine (i.e., gearbox stages, bearing design, etc.), a machine learning algorithm is capable to monitor deviation of monitoring sensors features compared to a healthy state. Machine learning can be used to monitor the quality of production by allowing the automation of the quality control process. Monitoring additive manufacturing process to detect defects during printing and allow mitigation through real-time machining and reprinting of the defective area.

Motor faults diagnosis based on the vibration data, one of the deep learning applications in the modern manufacturing model, is recently a tendency in the scientific community. Given that the vibration data is highly sensitive to a number of noises. The unnecessary motions of background can have a negative impact on the information input for the acceleration sensor.

The remaining useful life (RUL) of a jet engine is crucial for its operational efficiency, as it determines how long the engine can operate safely before Maintenance, Repair, and Operations (MRO) workshop visit. The process of determining the RUL is known as prognostics. Traditionally, data-driven prognostic methods rely on run-to-failure data, referred to as training data. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has provided the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (C–MAPSS) dataset, which is utilized for training our machine learning (ML) models. This investigation presents a probabilistic ML method, namely Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), which demonstrates superior effectiveness compared to a deterministic approach for training ML algorithms for data-driven prognostics. GPR is a Bayesian approach that does not require specific parameter values for regression problems. Three deterministic algorithms, namely Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Relevance Vector Regression (RVR), are compared with GPR. A scoring metric provided by NASA is used to compare the deterministic and probabilistic approaches. The MLP, SVR, RVR, and GPR scores are 18000, 1380, 1500, and 1045, respectively. The root mean square error (RMSE) for the different methods is 37.56, 20.96, 23.80, and 19.49, respectively. Among all the methods, the probabilistic GPR model achieves the best NASA score and the lowest RMSE, highlighting its superior performance over the deterministic methods. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.",2-s2.0-85218446679
"Electric Vehicle Battery Pack Prediction of Capacity Degradation Based on Deep Learning Architecture and Internet of Things As electric cars (EVs) become more widespread, research into battery life is becoming highly significant. Electric car batteries are now constantly connected and transmit information on a massive scale. The huge amounts of data produced, quite apart from the widespread use of the internet by these battery packs, provide new challenges for researchers and regulators. A unique deep learning model with use of internet of things (IoT) is suggested in this paper to produce a universal and accurate Li-ion battery aging prediction. On the other hand, deep learning (DL) is an efficient strategy for handling IoT problems including data analysis, prediction, and categorization. However, it is challenging to get the best data for deep learning in IoT for real-time prediction. The accuracy and robustness of prediction will be determined by data collecting components such as sensors and cameras. In this article, deep learning model Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) method is used to training and testing of the deep learning architecture. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) value for the deep learning model is 0.69, which will accurately predict vehicle battery pack data. Numerous articles have been published on improving deep learning models for RUL estimate of battery packs; however, there is no research of capacity degradation of battery pack estimation using IoT and deep learning approaches in the literature. In this research, a strategy for estimating the RUL of an electric car battery pack is described using deep learning and IoT. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2-s2.0-85178560361

"Machinery Retrofiting for Industry 4.0 The paper presents an approach for the retrofitting of industrial looms on the shop floor of a textile industry. This is a real case study, where there was a need to update the equipment, providing the machines with communication features aligned with the concept of Industry 4.0. The work was developed within the scope of the research project PRODUTECH-SIF: Solutions for the Industry of the Future. Temperature, Inductive, Acoustic and 3-axis Accelerometers sensors were installed in different parts of the machines for monitorization. Data acquisition and processing is done by a SmarBox developed on a cRIO 9040 from National Instruments. A SmartBox processes data from one to four looms, allowing these old machines to have communication capacity and to be monitored remotely through the factory plant’s MES/ERP. Communication can be done through the OPC UA or MQTT architecture, both protocols aligned with the new trends for industrial communications.

"Detection of Rare Fault Cases for Mobile Robot Applications Modern production and transport systems consist of many individual mechanical components, sensors, and actuators. Despite the complexity, critical errors must be diagnosed quickly to avoid the propagation of faults and the associated safety risks and production downtime. The problems are incomplete descriptions of the systems and disturbed sensor signals, which makes it difficult to use model-based methods directly. In this article, a method is presented that is based on the description of dynamical systems using Runge-Kutta Neural Networks (RKNN) as nominal models. RKNNs have a good ability to predict dynamic processes and can be trained with comparatively little data. Deviations from the real process behavior to the nominal behavior lead to generic fault symptoms classified by a second neural network. The fault cases are purely modeled with the help of the process data without providing special knowledge of the internal system behavior. The procedure was implemented and tested on a mobile robot for factory-internal transport processes. With little training data, a binary classification for elementary fault detection. The method can easily be adapted to other cases of dynamical systems. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",2-s2.0-85199140973
"Analysis and Modelling of Intelligent Gate Valve with Fault Detection and Prevention System for Fabrication Using 3D Printing Method Gate valves are one of the most extremely used valves in the oil and gas industry. However, previous researchers have found that gate valve tends to fail before its appointed time without prior notice. The causes of failures are often due to many factors which includes internal passing through gate even in fully closed position, wear, and external leakage at packing area. The goal of this study is to design a gate valve with reduced risk of failures and added intelligent functionality which will subsequently lengthen the lifespan of the valve and prevent unnoticed early failures. According to a previous computational study done in 2-dimension (2D), a gate valve’s wedge angle is best around 8° at which the fluid inside the valve generates the lowest velocity and pressure and hence the lowest gate deformation. To verify the claim, a 3-dimensional (3D) Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) method is conducted to study the fluid flow characteristics and deformation within gate valves in real-world scenario. From the CFD and FEA, the effect of varying wedge gate angle to the velocity, pressure, and gate deformation is studied and areas within gate valve that are most susceptible to failures are identified. Following the analysis, the valve geometry is improved to achieve optimum working conditions and lower risk of failures. In addition to the computational analysis, a study is also made to identify the type of sensor and the practicability of sensor embedded in metal body to add for the intelligent functionality of the valve, so that it is capable of early fault detection. In order to validate the CFD result obtained, a research paper that conducted the 2D analysis is referred to, and the analysis presented is performed identically in 2D via Altair SimLab. The percentage error is between 1 to 5%. Results show that the 3D analysis contradicts previous 2D research that indicated an 8º wedge angle to be the best angle. According to the 3D analysis, the more inclined the wedge angle, the lower the pressure, velocity, and gate deformation, implying that an angle of 9° is better than 8° and an angle of 10° is better than 9º, hence the contradiction. The 3D result is more reliable and accurate as it is more practical in industry. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85128949005
"A New Authentic Cloud Dataset from a Production Facility for Anomaly Detection As technology advances and modern Industry 4.0 solutions are becoming more widespread, the need for better-suited datasets is rising. The commonly used datasets for training machine learning focus on simple data of often publicly available information. Within the industry, there is only a handful of datasets publicly available to use. In this paper, we present a new authentic industrial cloud data (AICD) dataset collected from an actual operating pick-and-place machine handling items with variations in shape, size, and weight. The AICD dataset contains various analogue sensor values and states of the machine, collected from an existing cloud solution. Within the data, an error is present when the machine fails. Therefore, this dataset is suited for testing and developing predictive maintenance and anomaly detection algorithms to be used in the industry.

"Storm Water Drainage to Prevent Waterlogging It is not uncommon to have several parts of the city to get inundated when heavy rains along with thunderstorm lash a city. Lots of cars and motorcycles are stuck in traffic due to sudden showers, and traffic has to be diverted. No proper planning is in place, and the municipal corporation is not able to clear the waterlogging even with emergency teams. Sometimes, this coupled with uprooting of trees and disruption in electricity causes immense traffic congestion on the roads. The use of properly constructed drainage where a flow collection system with drainage pumps helps provide a better way to dewater road surfaces. A series of such pits is connected through a piping mechanism. The pits in turn are fitted with a submersible dewatering pump. The pumps can operate automatically when rain is detected or through a mobile phone or a central man-machine interface. Different physical properties of the pump, like temperature, pressure, etc., are modelled through sensors and time series data obtained. Different working modes of the pump are extracted and warning signs of breakage anticipated. Here, MLP is used to predict pump failure.

"Autonomous Mobile Robot Study in the Context of Maintenance 4.0 The popularization of technical objects’ autonomy in various transport branches is reflected in research on autonomous cars, drones, airplanes, ships, trains or mobile robots. Studies on autonomous mobile robots (AMR) mainly focus on navigation, localization, path planning and obstacle detection problems. These are the challenges of performing the defined tasks, i.e., reliable operation. In addition to these challenges, maintenance is an important issue rarely considered in the literature. One can find multiple papers concerning battery management, but there is definitely a lack of papers dedicated to failure consideration in the form of predictive maintenance applications. AMRs are highly complex objects with a serial reliability structure. Corrective and preventive maintenance strategies, used for many years in various objects and systems, are insufficient for such objects. New possibilities for maintenance are provided by the dynamic development of the Industry 4.0 concept. Along with it, the term Maintenance 4.0 has emerged. It assumes mainly the prediction of failures using sensors and machine learning algorithms. Considering AMR in the context of Maintenance 4.0 represents a new challenge not addressed in the literature to this time. The objective of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we would like to present a brief summary of the predictive maintenance methods available in the literature. Secondly, we would like to consider the AMR study for Maintenance 4.0 purposes. A general scheme of predictive maintenance method for AMR is introduced.

"Modified Long Short-Term Memory Algorithm for Faulty Node Detection Using node’s Raw Data Pattern Detection of faults in an automated manner is a very powerful computing technique. In recent years because of technological development, it is now possible to detect the fault based on raw sensor data patterns. Passive infrared sensor (PIR) is very useful in motion detection (human, animal, etc.) in the deployed field. We have proposed a modified scheme based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm for detecting faults in the PIR sensor module. Our mechanism is specifically tuned for the PIR sensor, which achieved 87% accuracy for detecting faults using the raw data pattern of the PIR sensor module. Further, we have computed loss concerning minibatch size and sample size to determine the modified mechanism's accuracy.

"Trajectory Control and Force Control of Biomimetic Fingers by Tendon-Based Actuation System Using Bond Graph Tendon-based actuation in natural fingers gives dexterity to execute daily life complex motions with ease. It is important to understand the biomechanical structure responsible for these motions. In the proposed work, a single link tendon-based actuation system with two biomimetic fingers has been designed and developed for trajectory and force control. This setup clearly demonstrates the concept of actuation of prosthetic finger of a partially impaired hand by using the motion of remaining natural fingers. The microcontroller plays the role of the human central nervous system (CNS) and provides pulse width modulation (PWM) signals generated through a proportional, integral and derivative (PID) control algorithm to the motor driver for actuation of the motor. The rotatory motion of the motor is converted into translatory motion of the nut by the lead-screw and slider-nut mechanism. Translation of the nut causes joint rotation of the active finger through string-tube mechanism. For joint angle feedback, optical potentiometer is used. For force feedback, force sensor based on strain gauges is designed and developed. The system is modelled using the graphical technique of bond graph, which is very useful for modelling these complex multi-energy domain biomechanical systems. In modelling the system, inertias both rotational and linear, frictional losses, string-tube mechanism modelling, losses in the motor inductance, etc., are all taken into account.

"Fundamental Analysis of a Circular Metal Sawing Process The most appropriate separation technique for the processing of solid metal parts with large dimensions is sawing. The cutting tools used in this machining process are exposed to very high mechanical and thermal loads, yet the highest precision, product quality and process stability must be guaranteed. With regard to process optimisation, the prediction of tool failure and the estimation of the remaining useful life is an important goal. In this paper, a first approach is presented to work towards the development of a degradation model for circular saw blades based on monitored process parameters. Such a degradation model could then be used to derive the key objectives presented above. The basis of this analysis is the recording of the sensor signals current, voltage, vibration and sound with a high sampling rate, whereby in the present work the focus will initially be on the first two signals mentioned - current and voltage. These signals were analysed in such a way that key indicators could be derived.

"Case Study on Bearing Fault Diagnosis in Liquid Rocket Engine Using Envelope Detection Technique The case study undertaken in the paper briefs the analysis of turbopump vibration parameters for prognostic health monitoring of a pump fed liquid rocket engine (LRE). Real-time vibration data acquired during ground testing of LRE is highly composite since all disturbances occurring during engine operation get transmitted to the sensor via structure. The resulting signal is a convolution of multiple forcing functions with transfer function of their concerned transmission path. Identifying weak impulses from bearing faults hence becomes a challenging task. The paper presents an application of envelope-based demodulation using high-frequency resonant technique (HFRT) to analyze a ground test vibration signal facilitating detection of bearing inner race fault at early stages of fault development. Comparison of the short-time Fourier transform spectra of raw data for the case discussed with an earlier test (used as reference signal with same deterministic frequencies) was found to distinguish carrier resonant frequency excited by the fault. The same was used as central frequency for a band-pass filter design for pre-processing of raw data with bandwidth set to nearly twice the fault frequency. The filtered signal was demodulated using Hilbert transform. Computation of power spectral density (PSD) for the demodulated waveform could distinctly detect the fault frequency with its first harmonic. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2-s2.0-85122587796

"Multi-sensor Failure Recovery in Aero-Engines Using a Digital Twin Platform: A Case Study Digital twin technology has found wide applications in the aerospace industry, for fleet monitoring, diagnostics, predictive maintenance, and manufacturing. Sensing the aero-engine in a test environment is challenging, due to issues with noisy and failed sensors, introduced by extreme conditions. Downstream diagnostics and prognostics require that key sensed values are available for the duration of the test for both real-time and off-line analysis. Virtual sensors that mimic the behavior of the physical sensors provide a resilient solution in the presence of such failures. This paper describes virtual sensors designed using a low-cost digital twin platform with off-the-shelf analytical software components and libraries. The platform is a no-code environment, that permits users to rapidly experiment with different analytical models and configurations. We show that virtual sensors can emulate the behavior of the physical sensor(s) in the event of multiple physical sensor failures with high accuracy, the design of which is facilitated by the Digital Twin platform. From a process standpoint, the Digital Twin results in several advantages to the organization including the breaking down of departmental data silos, reevaluation of key assumptions regarding system design, and the standardization of monitoring process.

"Comparison Analysis Through Condition Monitoring for Fault Detection of Bearing in Induction Motor In Industries, maintenance is an important activity to keep the equipment in a healthy condition. Condition-based maintenance (CBM) is a proactive maintenance technique that helps to fault diagnose of a machine system in running condition. This program is carried out in three steps: (i) detection; (ii) analysis; and (iii) correction. In CBM techniques, vibration analysis plays a vital role in identifying problems. The objective of this paper is to perform a comparison analysis of newly replaced bearings and corrected misaligned shaft for 630 kW induction motor with already existing healthy condition induction motor. This is done by vibration monitoring technique using fast Fourier transform (FFT) analyzer. The main attraction of this technique is that it can be performed even while the equipment is in normal working condition, thus saving precious downtime and avoiding production loss. This technique helps in diagnosing motor health by taking readings on drive end and non-drive end for both motors. By placing the accelerometer sensor in the tri-axial direction of motor vibration, data is obtained. These are in amplitude and time waveform signals and are collected at full load condition. This comparison analysis is a technique that helps to know the motor health condition. The obtained results are encouraging and identified the motor rolling bearing health status in running condition. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2-s2.0-85088998966

"Industrial automation of process for transformer monitoring system using IoT analytics Multiple devices interconnected with each other via the Internet are the key concept behind IoT. It allows autonomous devices with the possibility to use the Internet for communication and exchange of data. This paper focuses on monitoring the transformer in real-time fault detection and records distinct operating parameters of the transformer like voltage imbalance, load current, transformer oil levels, temperature, vibration. Based on these parameters, the transformers fail state (i.e. a state where transformer malfunctions or completely stops working) and health (i.e. voltage, current, oil levels, temperature and vibration) are predicted by making use of an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm. Use of this technology can minimize working efforts, thereby improving accuracy, stability, efficiency. Thus, remote monitoring and machine control are achieved, as well as ANNs help to determine the performance and yield appropriate measures accordingly. In this case, sensors are used to sense the important parameters of equipment such as current, voltage oil level in any operating transformer. By analyzing relevant data using ANNs, this system will be beneficial in many industries. Likewise, this system is generalized to be used in a wide array of industrial automated machines. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.",2-s2.0-85079287557
"Evaluation of the Dynamic Behavior of a Rotor Based on a Vibration Diagnosis This article attempts to evaluate the dynamic behavior of a rotor of a hydroelectric power station. The diagnostic approach adopted is predicated on vibration analysis using multi-sensor scanning technologies in the field of industry. 4.0. The proposed study helps monitor the dynamic state of health of the rotor in a manner relevant to maintenance 4.0. To achieve this, tests were carried out in different operating modes of the hydroelectric group (MAVNE, MAVEX, etc.). The tests culminated in a set of measurements, which are collected using several sensors (accelerometers, displacement probes) installed on the rotor bearings. The rotor is considered to be in good dynamic operating condition if two conditions are met, as the first requirement, its overall level of vibration is good or acceptable according to Standard ISO 10816-5. The second condition concerns the maximum eccentricity of the shaft line that does not exceed the theoretical clearance recommended by standard ISO 7919-5.

"Advanced Prognostics for a Centrifugal Fan and Multistage Centrifugal Pump Using a Hybrid Model Predictive maintenance is fully implemented in the oil and gas industry, and the impressive development of field sensors, big data, and digital twins offers a wide field for the ongoing experimentation and development of diagnostic and prognostic tools for machinery. Although a wide range of technologies and sensors is available, vibration analysis remains the preferred predictive technique for rotating machinery diagnostics. It is well-known, widely used, and has proven efficacious in evaluating the health of rotating machinery and preventing failures. Taking advantage of vibration analysis development and computing capabilities, this study develops three digital twins of one multistage centrifugal pump and two centrifugal fans using real vibration data and synthetic data. This hybrid model approach permits the use of failure data which are not usually found in the normal operation of these machines. The study improves and tunes the accuracy of those models using real operating data obtained from a distributed control system (DCS), thus obtaining results in accordance with process conditions. Maintenance decisions can be supported by these models. They are based on online vibration and process data; they diagnose the health of a machine and give its remaining useful life (RUL).

"Predictive Maintenance Framework for Production Environments Using Digital Twin In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end IoT framework for predictive maintenance with machine learning. With this framework, all the processes for developing a learning-based predictive maintenance model such as data acquisition, data preprocessing, training the machine learning model and making predictions about the status of an equipment are automatically carried out in real-time. Independent modules for all of those processes can be arranged and connected on a visual environment which enables creating unique and specialized pipelines. This framework also provides a digital twin simulation of the production environment integrated with the real world and the machine learning models to evaluate the effect of different parameters such as the cost or the throughput rate. Furthermore, system modules can be controlled from a single dashboard which makes the use of the system easier even for a non-experienced user.

"Automatic Underground Water Pipeline Fault Detection with Control in IoT Water is indispensable for our daily life such as drinking, cleaning, washing, and bathing. Continuing to wastewater can be very problematic in the future. Water benefits us in every aspect of our lives, from our homes to hydroelectric power plants. This is a very critical situation, and everyone has a responsibility to use water effectively in their daily life. This project aims to provide fault detection technology using an IoT technology. If it has leaks somewhere, it won’t always find it right away, but when it becomes a bigger problem, water will be wasting a lot. Therefore, it is desirable to act as soon as a leak occurs. To remedy this, we proposed a system in that uses multiple sensors to monitor water level, volume, and leakage and are detected by the ultrasonic sensor and floc sensor, respectively.

"Automatic Condition Monitoring System for Parcel Sorting Conveyor Systems Through Infrastructure-Free Sensor Technology in a Compact Mobile Data Logging Unit Suitable for a Variety of Packages Operators of logistics centers and manufacturing companies increasingly have to cope with unforeseeable fluctuations in goods throughput, changes in order structures and in the range of goods. Therefore, it is important to maintain the necessary conveyor systems permanently to avoid total breakdowns. To be able to detect the failure of key components in such a complex system in good time, this paper proposes a mobile objective measuring system with multiple sensors, which allows automatically record, compare and inform about normal/anomalous conditions from the perspective of a mobile observer moving in a parcel sorting system. Recent progresses in the availability and mobility of depth cameras enable the mobile observer spatially recognize its environment. Conveyor technology assemblies can be characterized by sensor fingerprints consisting of typical sensor readings and can thus be recognized in the collected data of a measurement run. With the help of a-priori knowledge, it is possible to derive the real path in space of the proposed mobile observer monitoring system. Anomalous sensor readings, like unexpected vibrations, can thus be assigned to the specific conveyor belts of the parcel sorting system. The mobile observer moves the same routes as the parcels would do and provides a unique and complete insight into the sorting system without requiring intrusive and complex sensor infrastructure installed throughout the whole system. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85102520687

"Facilitating Change Towards Predictive Maintenance Predictive maintenance is the promise of the future in infrastructure asset management. Predictive maintenance more and more uses sensor data. Sensors are relatively cheap, and their data mostly comes in huge quantities. Trends or flags may be observed in the data, sometimes with traditional statistical analyses and more often with advanced analyses such as machine learning techniques. These trends and flags may indicate a developing problem, allowing maintenance professionals to act before a failure occurs. However, as of today predictive maintenance is far from being common practice in infrastructure asset management. Failure mechanisms are often extremely complex. Besides knowing how to search for flags and trends, one should first know what to search for. Also, on the organisational side barriers are found. Often, big data is available in infrastructure organisations but underutilised for various reasons such as inaccessibility of data, client unfriendly user interfaces and a lack of tools to analyse data effectively by maintenance engineers. The current research investigates the potential for more predictive maintenance in current professional practices, not by adding new sensors but through exploitation of existing data (data mining) and removal of barriers which professionals experience in using such data. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85127631087
"Development of a Minimalistic Smart Sensor System for Motion Measurement of Wind Turbine Towers The accurate measurement of wind turbine tower motion is crucial for assessing structural integrity, identifying damages, and estimating remaining useful life.

"Early Fault Detection for Rotating Machinery Onboard Ships Motor Using Fuzzy Logic and K-Means Many industries have now adopted the predictive maintenance approach to increase the life span of the equipment. So as a part of predictive maintenance, early estimation of faults in the motor is a pivotal component as it helps in many ways, such as minimizing time, cost, and efforts for equipment maintenance. However, it is challenging to find the data on the faulty condition of the electric motor, so based on hypothetical points of faulty conditions are added. Data is used to monitor conditions generated by different sensors deployed on an electric motor. This paper mainly focuses on early fault detection for rotating machinery onboard ships’ motors using two other methods of fuzzy logic and K-means. The fuzzy technique uses a rule-based approach, and K-means uses an unsupervised approach for the early detection of faults in the motor. In the proposed work, the fuzzy logic technique takes vibration and voltage as inputs to the fuzzy inference system. And, K-means takes input features extracted by the feature extraction technique to monitor the motor condition. Experiments show that fuzzy logic can readily determine the condition of the electric motor with only two inputs, and K-means can easily differentiate clusters of motors under different conditions with the help of features extracted using PCA. The proposed work has identified the conditions of the motor, such as good, acceptable, monitored closely, and unacceptable, which helps in early fault detection. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2-s2.0-85168758824

"A Review of Smart Condition Monitoring System for Gearbox Gears are the most critical and commonly used machine elements. They are used for a variety of applications throughout various industries like energy, aerospace, transportation, mining, agriculture, manufacturing, etc. The failure of gear may result in cataclysmic shutdowns causing significant production, economic losses and even human casualties. Fault diagnosis is an important component of condition-based maintenance and it has gained much attention for the safe operation of the gearboxes. But in many applications, fault diagnosis is not accurate. Sensor-based condition monitoring systems help in enhancing the quality of measurement data. A lot of research has been done in developing machine learning algorithms and models to extract information of fault status from the sensor data.

"Reconstructing Speed from Vibration Response to Detect Wind Turbine Faults Speed information is often necessary to detect certain failure modes in wind turbines, such as unbalance, looseness, misalignment, and gear related problems. This is normally obtained from tacho sensors targeting certain shafts, e.g. generator shaft or main shaft. Tacho pulses can be used to track rotational speed of certain components as well as to perform angular resampling. Most importantly, knowing machine speed is necessary for alarming speed dependent failure modes. Correct speed information may be unavailable due to broken tacho sensor and incorrect setting of the sensor. Consequently, many failure modes cannot be detected when the information is not available. Unable to detect these failure modes early may cause unexpected secondary damages that leads to unexpected downtime of the wind turbines and loss of production. Maintenance work on correcting speed sensor is costly, especially for offshore wind turbines, and may result in downtime. Furthermore, condition monitoring system (CMS) of wind turbines is significantly cheaper without speed sensors; considering a wind farm normally consists of many wind turbines. Therefore, it is important to acquire speed information without the need for having a tacho sensor. This paper presents an industrial implementation of speed reconstruction based on vibration response to detect speed-related faults, such as unbalance and gear faults. Speed is determined by frequency demodulation of response vibration signals. Hilbert transform is used to extract the instantaneous frequency, where the derivative of the analytic signal is done in the frequency domain. Using data from wind turbines monitored by Brüel & Kjær Vibro, we show this method can detect speed-related faults as early as when the speed information is available through real speed sensor. The method was able to detect unbalance, misalignment and looseness on wind turbine generators, as well as gear-related problems on high speed stage, intermediate stage, and planetary stage gearboxes. This offers the possibility of reducing the cost of wind turbines CMS significantly. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2-s2.0-85102649223
"Anomaly Detection for Predictive Maintenance on the Example of an Induced Draft of a Waste Power Plant Thanks to Artificial Intelligence algorithms, new digital systems that supervise machines in production or in power plants are more and more enabled to provide pattern recognitions realizing predictive maintenance workflows. Nevertheless, the requirements of predictive maintenance are still very challenging when it is applied on machines which are not completely new and do not consist of intelligent PLC-systems offering all required interfaces to sensors and actors out-of-the-box. That is why other embedded systems are needed to implement predictive maintenance systems for machines that are not controlled by a PLC. Furthermore, these systems usually do not have any internet connection at all. This results in two requirements for so called “retro-fitted” predictive maintenance solutions: (1) External hardware and sensors are needed; (2) The system must be offline-capable [1]. This paper focuses on the development of an offline-capable anomaly detection system analyzing the footprint of a waste incinerator power plant’s induced draft. The induced draft is responsible to drain the poisoned gas out of the power plant’s burning chamber. It is not a redundant component and a critical element of the smoke gas cleaning system. The goal of the footprint analysis in this paper is to find out if an external embedded system with sensors could be used to find anomalies in the behavior of the machine offering the possibility to estimate maintenance cycles as well as to predict dangerous incidents. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85149641626

"A Novel Method for Gearbox Fault Diagnosis Based on Shift-Invariant and Shared Dictionary Learning Gearbox fault diagnosis is a very crucial part in the field of mechanical diagnosis, and many methods are proposed to solve this problem. Either way, the core idea of fault diagnosis is to extract the class-specific features from the signals collected by different sensors. Although different types of faults own different class-specific features, they also generally possess common features. Especially for gearboxes, there are many complex components in the vibration signals, where many features may belong to more than one fault class, so analyzing and removing these common features before feature extraction is a quite significant process for a more efficient diagnosis. However, at present, few articles are proposed to solve the problem of common features. Inspired by a shared idea, we proposed a novel fault diagnosis method named shift-invariant and shared dictionary learning (SISDL), which consists of shared dictionary and diagnostic dictionary with shift-invariant. The shared dictionary is responsible for learning the common features from different fault classes. Meanwhile, the diagnostic dictionary is responsible for learning the class-specific features. Our proposed method with other five state-of-the-art dictionary learning methods is applied in a experimental gearbox case, and the results verify the advantage of SISDL over the others. © International Society of Engineering Asset Management 2024.",2-s2.0-85206379684

The development of DIMOSS® (DIsplacement MOnitoring using Strain Sensors) software fits this context. DIMOSS® is a structural monitoring software for reconstructing fundamental quantities to assess the health of a structure, displacements and stresses. The software relies on strain sensors and it is based on the inverse Finite Element Method (iFEM). The software integrates iFEM and all the tools needed to design and operate a monitoring system. This paper introduces the theoretical background and the design approach of DIMOSS®. Moreover, it presents two successful experimental applications of the software: the monitoring of a stiffened composite wing-shaped panel and the live monitoring of an aluminium beam through the realisation of a structural digital twin. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",2-s2.0-85214092452
"Early Fault Detection in Safety Critical Systems Using Complex Morlet Wavelet and Deep Learning Automated Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) plays an important role in health monitoring of safety critical systems. Typically, critical industrial processes involve voluminous number of sensors that are capable of assessing the system’s working condition and health. Time series analysis of sensor measurements can be used to predict potential system errors before the damage is irreparable. Predictive analysis is quintessential to reduce the system downtime and the costs associated. A major challenge in FDD is to detect faults much before the full-length time series is available, such that reliable predictions are achieved early in time. Thus, Early Classification of Time Series (ECTS) has to deal with the trade-off between accuracy and earliness, unlike conventional approaches that handle only accuracy. This paper proposes Complex Morlet Wavelet (CMW)-based time–frequency analysis for ECTS in a Deep Learning (DL) framework that combines Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network. The proposed approach is validated using the publicly available Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) dataset. Results demonstrate that CMW in combination with hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for ECTS. The scheme is benefited by the DL architecture that combines CNN and LSTM, rather than these architectures considered individually. The proposed approach is able to achieve superior joint accuracy-earliness optimization when compared to time domain and frequency domain analyses considered separately, conventional Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT)-based time–frequency analysis, and other state-of-the-art time–frequency approaches. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2-s2.0-85123417787
"The Predictive Maintenance of Vacuum Furnaces for Carburising Processes Low-pressure carburising processes are an important element of thermo-chemical treatment in such as the automotive, aviation and/or mechanical engineering industries. The reliability of heat treatment equipment is crucial due to the load placed on them and the possible costs associated with downtime. The value of the damaged charge to be treated, can sometimes exceed the value of the kiln itself. This article presents an analysis of low-pressure carburising processes carried out at a pit furnace with ceramic insulation, with special reference to the accumulation of carbon deposits on heating elements. The accumulation of carbon deposits on heating elements and current feedthroughs can lead to excess voltages and to these heating elements becoming damaged. Based on the research conducted, a procedure for burning out the carbon deposit has been developed, which is an element of the predictive maintenance of equipment for low-pressure heat treatment in carburising processes. Carrying out the procedure is based on data collected by a sensor dedicated to detecting the level of carbon deposits. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85174448271
"Predictive Analytics for Oil and Gas Asset Maintenance Using XGBoost Algorithm One of the most important aspects of the oil and gas industry is asset management at their respective platforms. Without proper asset management, it will lead to various unexpected scenarios including an increase in plant deterioration, increased chances of accidents and injuries, and breakdown of assets at unexpected times which will lead to poor and hurried maintenance. Given the significant economic contribution of the oil and gas sector to oil-producing countries like Malaysia, accurate asset maintenance prediction is essential to ensure that the oil and gas platform can manage its operations profitably. This research identifies the parameters affecting the asset failure on oil and platform that will be interpreted using the XGBoost gradient boosting model from machine learning libraries. The model is used to predict the asset’s lifetime based on readings collected from the sensors of each machine. From result, our prediction method using XGBoost for asset maintenance has presented a 6.43% increase in classification accuracy as compared to the Random Forest algorithm. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85144978445
"Vehicle Usage Extraction Using Unsupervised Ensemble Approach Current heavy vehicles are equipped with hundreds of sensors that are used to continuously collect data in motion. The logged data enables researchers and industries to address three main transportation issues related to performance (e.g. fuel consumption, breakdown), environment (e.g., emission reduction), and safety (e.g. reducing vehicle accidents and incidents during maintenance activities). While according to the American Transportation Research Institute (ATRI), the operational cost of heavy vehicles is around 59 % of overall costs, there are limited studies demonstrating the specific impacts of external factors (e.g. weather and road conditions, driver behavior) on vehicle performance. In this work, vehicle usage modeling was studied based on time to determine the different usage styles of vehicles and how they can affect vehicle performance. An ensemble clustering approach was developed to extract vehicle usage patterns and vehicle performance taking into consideration logged vehicle data (LVD) over time. Analysis results showed a strong correlation between driver behavior and vehicle performance that would require further investigation. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85137975588
"An IoT Architecture to Enhance Monitoring and Predictive Maintenance for Cultural Heritage Buildings The significant value related to cultural heritage (CH) is inestimable, and it also represents a resource in economic terms due to tourism. Therefore, CH must be safeguarded to avoid losses that in many cases can no longer be recovered. Due to the variability of elements and conditions, each step in CH protection and conservation is represented by a wide range of variable factors. In this scenario, the ability to intervene seems limited, given the variety of factors to be monitored remotely. However, the deployment of current technology, which retains the ability to provide low-cost sensors, could significantly contribute. The purpose of this paper is to introduce an IoT-based methodology for cultural heritage preservation. Expert users have tested a system prototype to monitor and manage a portion of a building within the Archaeological Park of Pompeii, predict deterioration, and schedule conservation interventions and choose the combination of interventions.

"Sensor Selection for Smart Retrofitting of Existing Plants The chemical, process, and energy generation industries are essential production industries worldwide. However, these traditionally powerful industrial sectors have been under ever-increasing cost pressure in recent years, so the companies are continuously trying to improve wage- and energy-intensive products as well as services through the use of digitalization of production processes, e.g., to use operational data to optimize processes by tailoring them to customer needs and, at the same time, cutting operation and production costs. The machines and equipment in these industries are typically operated for several decades and cannot be directly integrated into the newly developed digitized processes. One of the possibilities to perform a so-called smartification of the machines and equipment is to retrofit them with sensors and data processing hardware. The present paper presents a methodology for the systematic selection of sensors for retrofitting existing and operating plants. For this purpose, the requirements for the selection process have been established. The advantages and disadvantages of existing methods for sensor selection are presented and analyzed. Subsequently, a new methodology for sensor selection is presented and successfully validated in the retrofit process of an existing and still operating for 20 years 900 kW wind turbine. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85163397789

"Acoustic Emission-Based Grinding Wheel Condition Monitoring Using Decision Tree Machine Learning Classifiers Condition monitoring has emerged as an important technique in manufacturing industries for predictive maintenance and on-line monitoring of the processes and equipments. Due to the availability of sensors and signal processing technology, implementing condition monitoring systems in a manufacturing environment has become easy. In this paper, grinding wheel conditions in a surface grinding process are predicted with a simple decision tree-based machine learning classifier using time-domain acoustic emission signature. A grinding wheel attachment is designed and fabricated for capturing acoustic emission (AE) signal from the grinding wheel. Grinding wheel conditions are established using grinding wheel life cycle plot by monitoring surface roughness produced by the silicon carbide grinding wheel for the entire grinding cycle. AE signals were captured using the experimental set-up established for this study and statistical features are extracted from transients of AE. Classification and regression trees (CART) are used for establishing a correlation between AE features and grinding wheel conditions. The performance of the CART algorithms is evaluated using Gini index, towing and maximum deviation split criterions. Results indicate CART algorithms are efficiently predicting the grinding wheel condition with good accuracy. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2-s2.0-85079152050

"A Multiple Actuator and Sensor Fault Estimation for Dynamic Systems The paper deals with the problem of simultaneous actuator and sensor fault estimation for linear dynamic systems on which influence unknown exogenous disturbances. The most common approach of dealing with fault estimation approach is that either actuator or sensor fault estimation schemes are provided in the literature. This paper proposes a kind of a fusion of those approaches which results with the capability of estimation of actuator and sensor faults which might appear in the system simultaneously. The novelty relies on that the unwelcome rate of change of the fault factor is vanished which simplifies the design problem. The methodology utilized in the paper to attain the robustness is the so-called Quadratic boundedness approach.

"AR and IoT Integrated Machine Environment (AIIME) Machine maintenance accounts for 15–40% of overall manufacturing costs. Moreover, industries have progressed from breakdown type of maintenance to most recent and modern, predictive maintenance (PdM) which heavily relies on data collection. This has paved the way for IoT to be adopted for PdM. Many manufacturers are coming up with machines with built-in sensors for parameter monitoring; this makes them expensive. However, many machines are already in use, and putting sensors for data collection and applying the Internet of Things to such machines is a huge task. The concept of modular sensor systems is proposed in this article to address that. Also, with an increase in fast computing, augmented reality is getting adopted for many applications. It has the potential to enhance reality and impact many fields. It is found that less work has been done on integrating the industrial Internet of Things with augmented reality.

"Research on Data Standardization of Airborne Embedded Equipment Based on IPMI The PHM of embedded equipment is a major component of aircraft design, in which conscious efforts are made to shift aircraft maintenance from unplanned and reactive methods during failures to more proactive and predictive methods. It involves data processing, including capturing data related to aircraft components, monitoring parameters, evaluating current or future health conditions, and providing recommended maintenance measures. Multiple sensors, processing units, and software are required to perform data processing functions. To meet the consistent management requirements of airborne embedded equipment composed of components from different suppliers, a universal data specification for airborne embedded equipment based on the IPMI standard protocol is proposed to meet the interoperability of health management data between different suppliers. Relying on the Intelligent Platform Management Controller (IPMC) to obtain voltage, current, temperature, and state discrete data of the substrate, and comparing the data with the set values of the Sensor Data Record (SDR), generate event information in standard data format and send it to the Chassis Management Controller (CHMC) through the Intelligent Platform Management Bus (IPMB), where CHMC obtains the event information of the IPMC, Filter events and store the System Event Logs (SEL) in standard data format, while responding based on diagnostic results. Through the instantiation verification of typical embedded equipment, the integrity and effectiveness of the airborne embedded equipment data specification and hardware PHM function designed in this article are verified. After verification, this article provides a robust framework that allows each implementer to add their own enhanced functions without affecting interoperability, meeting data compatibility among multiple embedded equipment suppliers, especially addressing interoperability and enterprise system integration. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",2-s2.0-85200493907

"Detection of Broken Rotor Bar Fault in an Induction Motor Employing Motor Current Signature Analysis In the present industrial scenario, an induction motor plays an important part for any industry. Any faults in induction motor may lead to expensive and catastrophic for a plant, which may directly influence the reliability of the whole system. Also, rotor faults constitute an important portion of all electrical machine faults and can be a key reason for downtime of the system. Therefore, rotor fault diagnosis of an induction at an early stage can avoid the costly breakdown in an industrial plant. The present work proposed a novel detection algorithm for broken rotor bar in an induction motor using motor current signature analysis (MCSA) which is able to detect fault at an early stage. Real-time motor current from stator winding of an induction motor was acquired and developed algorithms were applied for the detection of broken rotor bar fault. Previously, other sensors such as vibration sensors were also used for this purpose but, those are invasive in nature with high cost however, current sensors are non-invasive and low cost which allow the current sensors-based techniques easier to implement. In this work, statistical method such as multiscale entropy (MSE) algorithm is used as a novel technique which is extracted from the real-time motor current for the detection of broken rotor bar fault. Later, support vector machine (SVM) has been successfully implemented to diagnose the fault at early stage with minimum accuracy of 90.1%. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2-s2.0-85131956828
"Deep Learning for a Comprehensive Transformer Fault Detection Through Vibrational Data This paper presents a comprehensive view of the vibrational analysis preformed on a three-phase oil-immersed transformer by expanding and deepening our previous research works. The aim is to show the virtue of deep neural networks in transformer fault detection, as well as to study the vibrational behavior of the transformer tank, a topic that, in literature, has not yet been thoroughly studied. This analysis, which focuses on transformer windings failures, is based on real vibration data recorded by optical sensors located on the transformer tank. The failure of the windings was reproduced by their loosening in a laboratory environment. The measured vibrational spectra were used to develop a classifier capable of detecting winding loosening. Compared to the literature, the robustness of the obtained classifier against possible sensor misplacement was also investigated, which led to an analysis of the tank locations most relevant to this type of analysis. This analysis proved that neural networks were able to detect fault with a high accuracy, robustly to possible misplacements in the positioning of the sensor, and that the no-load condition performed better the load condition. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",2-s2.0-85160204526
"Multi-attention Based Multi-scale Temporal Convolution Network for Remaining Useful Life Prediction of Rolling Bearings Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is the key to prognostic health management (PHM) of rolling bearings. Multiple sensors are usually used to monitor the comprehensive data of the rolling bearing operation. To the best of our knowledge, most of the existing research work does not consider the effects of different sensors and different features to RUL prediction results, so they cannot accurately understand more comprehensive information about rolling bearings. Therefore, it is necessary to weigh the information of different sensors and assign weights to the features extracted by the neural network. This paper proposes a RUL prediction method of rolling bearings based on multi-attention and multi-scale temporal convolution network (MA-MTCN). Specifically, the channel attention mechanism is used to weigh different sensors and the feature attention mechanism is used to weigh different features which extract by multi-scale temporal convolutional networks. The temporal convolutional networks are used to extract the complete features and time series features between data. Finally, the feasibility of this method is verified by PHM2012 dataset. Experimental results prove that the MA-MTCN method can reduce the error of RUL prediction to less than 5%. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",2-s2.0-85186709211
"Adaptive State Feedback Fault-Tolerant Tracking Control for Uncertain Nonlinear Systems with Sensor Failures In this paper, an adaptive state feedback fault-tolerant control (FTC) scheme is proposed for a class of nonlinear systems with system uncertainties and all state sensor failures, in which each state is measured by a sensor and all state sensors may suffer from failures during system operation. By constructing an adaptive dynamic gain, the unknown sensor failures and system uncertainties can be compensated simultaneously without fault detection and identification. The compensation controller is constructed by all sensor measurements and dynamic gain. It is shown that with the proposed method, all the closed-loop signals are bounded, and the measurable tracking error can converge to an arbitrarily small residual set. An electromechanical actuator (EMA), which has been used in different aircraft subsystems, such as surface control, fuel metering unit, thrust vector control, etc., is used to demonstrate the application of the proposed scheme. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2-s2.0-85117967428

"Designing of IoT Device Compatible Chaos-Based Phasor Measurement Unit Data Encryption Technique Phasor measurement units (PMUs) have become an integral part of the power grid. Many of the crucial decisions in power grid like load shedding, early detection of fault, fault event detection, and its classification are done using PMU data. It becomes imperative to ensure integrity security of PMU data looking at its importance in making vital decisions in power grid. Although IEEE C37.118 standards provide the guidelines for phasor measurement, data format and its transmission order but no mechanism of end-to-end security is given. The presented research work focuses on designing a chaos-based cryptography technique to guarantee PMU data integrity security. For this, a logistic–sine one-dimensional (1D) chaotic map is used to encrypt the PMU data. This map is represented by simple equation which can be easily implemented in a resource constrained IoT devices. The bifurcation diagram of logistic–sine map has been simulated on MATLAB R2018b platform. It is shown that as compared to traditional maps, the logistic–sine map has better chaotic properties in terms of range of bifurcation parameter and uniformity in chaotic sequence. Later, an encryption algorithm has been proposed to encrypt PMU data using chaotic logistic–sine map and implemented on MATLAB R2018b platform. Finally, security analysis of proposed encryption algorithm has been done in terms of key space, key sensitivity, and histogram.

"Real-Time Vibration Monitoring Using MEMS Vibration Sensors During operation, machines or objects generate vibration and there are unwanted vibrations that will disrupt the overall system, which results in faults such as imbalance, crack, wear, and misalignment. Thus, collecting and analyzing the vibration data has become an effective method in monitoring the condition of an object. There are many instruments to acquire vibration data and techniques to analyse the collected data. In this study, two types of vibration sensors are applied to collect and visualizes the vibration data in real-time, which are SW420 vibration sensors and ADXL345 accelerometers. The sensors are mounted on the rod, which is attached to the motor to determine the effect of the mounting position on the vibration. Then, a threshold value is set to see the reliability of these vibration sensors in detecting faults. Based on the results, mounting the vibration sensor closer to the source of vibration will generate higher vibration and both sensors can successfully detect a fault, set by the threshold values. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2-s2.0-85125261445
"Performance Evaluation of Different CNN Models for Motor Fault Detection Based on Thermal Imaging Motor faults can lead to significant operational and financial losses. In this paper, we evaluated the performance of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, including Alexnet, VGG, and ResNet, for motor fault detection using thermal imaging. We have also tested the effect of Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) on the accuracy of these models. Our approach involves first generating a new dataset using CLAHE to enhance the original dataset, followed by training AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet models using transfer learning technique. The accuracy of the models is tested using the enhanced and original datasets as inputs. The results show that using the enhanced images significantly improves the accuracy of VGG11 and VGG13 models, but it deteriorates the performance of AlexNet. For ResNet models, the improvement is minimal or even slightly decreased. The reason could be due to insufficient training or overfitting since there are limited number of images in the dataset. Overall, ResNet models achieved the best performance with the highest accuracy of 99.62%. Thus, it can be concluded that ResNet models are better suited for detecting motor fault from thermal images.

"The Distribution Characteristics of the Leakage Magnetic Field in the Transformer Under Winding Deformation Transformer is the core equipment in power system power conversion, and its importance is self-evident. As one of the main forms of transformer fault, timely and effective detection of winding deformation can ensure the stability of transformer operation. When the winding deformation fault occurs in the transformer, the shape and spatial position of the winding will change, which directly leads to the change of the leakage magnetic field distribution. It is very promising to study the online detection method of transformer winding deformation based on the characteristics of leakage magnetic field. Monitoring the state change of leakage magnetic field of transformer is the key step, and the arrangement of sensors affects the leakage magnetic field of monitoring transformer. Therefore, the key is to study the optimal arrangement method of leakage magnetic field sensors in transformer. In this paper, the simulation model of transformer winding deformation is established. The internal leakage magnetic field distribution of transformer under normal operation and different winding deformation is simulated and analyzed, and the variation law of leakage magnetic field distribution is summarized. The results show that different winding deformations lead to different leakage magnetic field distribution characteristics. On this basis, the optimal arrangement method of the leakage magnetic field sensor inside the transformer is proposed, which provides a basis for the online detection method of transformer winding deformation based on the characteristics of leakage magnetic field. © 2023, Beijing Paike Culture Commu.

"Fault Diagnosis and Fault-Tolerant Method for Current Sensors in Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors As the complexity of interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) applications in drive control systems increases, ensuring their safe and reliable operation has become a research focus. However, current sensors as key components in motor drive system subject to various faults. Fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control for current sensors are crucial to maintain system stability and reliability during sensor faults to ensure the safe operation of PMSM drive control systems. A fault diagnosis method based on offset coordinate system analysis is proposed in this paper, considering three fault modes of current sensors: fix, bias, and constant gain. To realize fault-tolerant control, a full-order sliding-mode observer (SMO) for IPMSM is also constructed. In the event of current sensor fault, a current error space vector reconstruction algorithm is taken to estimate three-phase current with a single current sensor, thereby achieving fault tolerance control.

"Implementing Intelligent Monitoring of the Technical Condition of Locomotive Hydraulic Transmissions The study is aimed at replacing outdated approaches in the organization of maintenance of the locomotive fleet. The article presents a comparative analysis of maintenance strategies for traction rolling stock. The necessity of introducing control over the technical condition of locomotives to ensure the transition to a preventive maintenance system is substantiated. Directions of research - adjustment of the existing volumes and frequency of repairs, the introduction of individual repair strategies, the introduction of adapted and flexible approaches to the maintenance of locomotives. To improve the efficiency of monitoring the technical condition of locomotives, the use of factor analysis methods is proposed. The purpose of using factor analysis methods is to reduce the number of analysed parameters, while the information content of monitoring the technical condition should not decrease. The results of applying the method of principal components to assess the technical condition of the hydraulic transmission of a diesel locomotive during testing are presented. It is proposed to use the concept of latent diagnostic parameters to assess the technical condition of locomotive units. Considering the physical meaning of the processes occurring in the hydraulic transmission, as a result of the analysis, three groups of latent parameters were identified: “Load”, “Losses”, “Input”. These parameters characterize the technical condition of the hydraulic transmission. Each of the latent parameters includes information from a group of physical process sensors.

"A Fault Diagnosis Method for AUVs Based on Meta-Self-Attentive Variable-Scale CNN Ocean investigation is made possible by autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), and the safe navigation of these vehicles depends on the ability to diagnose actuator faults quickly. However, the complicated marine environment and the restricted availability of failure data due to unexpected failures present a significant difficulty for troubleshooting. A meta-self-attention variable-scale convolutional neural network (MSAVS-CNN) model for fault diagnosis of AUVs is proposed in this paper. The model directly utilizes raw vibration data collected from sensors as input. To enhance the convergence speed, a subtask-based gradient optimization method is employed during model fitting. In the feature extraction process, a self-attentive variable-scale approach is employed, enabling the acquisition of information at different scales and facilitating the autonomous learning of crucial features through convolutional kernel size adjustments. In situations where sample availability is limited, the suggested method leverages a meta-learning approach to train the diagnostic model, thereby improving its ability to generalize and enabling cross-domain diagnosis. Experiments confirm the validity of the method and show that the suggested method can diagnosis the actuator failure of AUVs with few samples. © Beijing HIWING Scientific and Technological Information Institute 2024.",2-s2.0-85192376303
"Investigation of the Use of FBG-T Fibre Sensor for Detecting Broken Bar Fault in Induction Machine The use of fiber bragg gratings (FBG) as optical sensors continues to see a wide range of science and engineering applications. These applications have utilised different measuring parameters to monitor and detect abnormalities within the systems where FBGs are installed. This paper utilises FBG bonded to a giant magnetostrictive material, Terfenol-D (FBG-T), and electrical machine stray flux (EMSF), to realise non-invasive condition monitoring of an induction motor. With a DC motor and two identically rated three phase induction motors, FBG-T was used for rotor cage damage detection in this work. In addition to observed bragg shifts, spectral behaviour of the resulting grating profile as well as distinct feature extraction from observed plots were used to clearly detect the fault in the induction motor. The faulty machine experienced about 5 pm more shift than the healthy machine for a maximum magnetic flux density of about 0.18mT; and followed a distinct and aberrant path. With both healthy and faulty machines continuously monitored for 20 h at different frequencies, both machines were observed to respectively have maximum Braggshifts of about 68 pm and 78 pm at 20 Hz. The results do show that the faulty machine with the broken rotor consistently recorded more Braggshifts than the healthy motor at all frequencies. This resulted in a distinct and aberrant sensing profile which detects the fault in a non-intrusive manner. The FBG-T sensor used in this way offers a huge potential in non-intrusive machine condition monitoring which crucially overcomes the ease of breakage of the fibre when installed inside the motor leading to offline intervention to replace the sensor and maximal downtime and cost. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2-s2.0-85141700108
"Diagnosis Methods for Mechatronic Systems Mechatronic systems are widely used in many industrial applications for their capacity to improve the production performances. However, due to the complexity of these systems, several defects may occur and disrupt the operating of the system. Among these faults, two types can be distinguished: operating faults (e.g., electrical, mechanical, thermal, design defects, &#x0024;&#x0024;\ldots &#x0024;&#x0024;) and sensor faults (e.g., bias, gain or drift defects). In this paper, we present a classification of the most frequently used diagnosis methods based on the type of the redundancy: the hardware or the analytical redundancy. Secondly, we propose a new diagnosis technique, called sparse recovery method. This method is based on a dynamical sparse recovery algorithm in order to detect, locate and isolate several faults which can affect the considered system. More precisely, sparse recovery method can be applied to estimate a sparse vector of possible faults based on few system measurements. This diagnosis method is based on system modeling presented in healthy and faulty cases.

"Research on the Adsorption Performance of β-Ga2O3 on C2H4 Gas in Transformer Oil C2H4 is an essential characteristic gas in the oil of oil-immersed power transformers used to assess the occurrence of faults. Its online monitoring provides an effective reflection of the transformer's operating conditions in real time. To address the problem that conventional gas sensors are not responsive to characteristic gases, this paper uses an ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor material (β-Ga2O3) as a gas sensor to detect the fault characteristic gas C2H4. The structural and electronic properties of β-Ga2O3 have been investigated by means of first principles calculations, and its gas-sensitive mechanism and adsorption properties have been analyzed. Firstly, the optimal adsorption position of C2H4 gas on the β-Ga2O3 surface was determined by structural optimization; secondly, the adsorption behavior of C2H4 gas on the β-Ga2O3 surface was obtained by further analysis of the charge density difference, adsorption energy, electronic density of states, band structure and work function of the adsorption model. The results show that when C2H4 gas is adsorbed on the surface of β-Ga2O3, new surface states appear in the electronic density of states and band structure near the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum, which facilitates the carrier transfer between the valence and conduction bands. Also acting as an electron acceptor, β-Ga2O3 attracts electrons from the C2H4 gas molecule with a strong adsorption effect. The paper explores the potential of applying β-Ga2O3 materials to the detection of dissolved gases in typical transformer oils, provides a theoretical basis for gas-sensitive adsorption, and demonstrates that β-Ga2O3 has excellent gas-sensitive properties for C2H4 gas. © 2023, Beijing Paike Culture Commu.

"FBG-T Sensor for Non-intrusive Broken Rotor Fault Severity Detection in Induction Machines Fiber bragg gratings (FBG) as optical sensors continue to gain increasing relevance in sensing and instrumentation owing to their numerous advantages including immunity to electromagnetic interference (EMI). This paper experiments on the use of a giant magnetostrictive material, Terfenol-D bonded to an FBG hereafter called FBG-T to detect external flux from electrical machines in a non- invasive manner. A DC motor and two identically rated three phase induction motors, FBG-T were used for rotor cage damage detection in this work. Further damage to the faulty rotor was carried out to observe if the FBG-T would distinguish severity in machine fault condition. Results show that the more severely faulted machine experienced the most Braggshift of about 20 pm more than the healthy machine at 5 Hz, compared to the less severely faulted machine which showed about 15 pm more than the healthy machine. Another striking observation was the consistency in the distinct and deviant path followed by both faulty motor conditions when compared to the healthy motor. The more severe the rotor damage fault was, the larger the divergence from the healthy motor signature. The results do show that the faulty machine with the broken rotor consistently recorded more Bragg shifts than the healthy motor at all frequencies. This resulted in a distinct and aberrant sensing profile which detects the fault in a non-intrusive manner. In addition to observed bragg shifts, divergence levels in grating profile from the healthy reference condition was used to succinctly detect the fault severity in the induction motor condition. This is hugely significant because of the non-intrusive nature of the technique given the ease-of-breakage and the challenges faced when FBG installed in machine stator slots are to be replaced. This technique easily overcomes the inevitable requirements of the offline FBG replacement and its associated economic costs including downtime. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2-s2.0-85141737852

Input values given to these components can be degraded by internal and external disturbances, it can happen either by virtue of foreign factors, to the lack of efficiency in the sensors, or maybe due to unknown lags in the communication systems. Hence, it is vital when the output responses related to these devices stay as robust when slightest fluctuations occur. Layout of robust components has been reported as primary challenge in the implementation of electronic systems.

"Detection of Sensor Fault in a DC Microgrid Using Supertwisting Observer The detection of sensor faults in a direct current (DC) microgrid is essential to provide a safe and uninterrupted supply of power. The fault detection techniques in the DC microgrid should involve immediate sensor fault detections to protect the system from adverse effects. To address this issue, in this paper, a fault detection technique is designed which addresses the scenario where the interconnected distributed generation units (DGUs) are affected by sensor faults in a DC microgrid. Multiplicative faults in the grid-connected voltage and current sensors are considered. A model-based multiple sliding mode observers (HOSM) are designed to estimate the states of the DGUs, and faulty sensors are detected based on the generated residuals. The stability of the overall microgrid system can be achieved by designing a hierarchical controller which ensures uniform current sharing among all the DGUs. The validation of the proposed method is supported through extensive MATLAB simulations for various arrangements of the DC microgrid subjected to numerous known and unknown disturbances.

"Reducing Uncertainty in Failure Prediction Using Singular Value Decomposition Feature Selection Uncertainty is one of the indicators to evaluate the prediction of deep learning models. In real-world prognostic domain, predicting failure with uncertainty provides users with powerful argument when important decisions related to safety, security and monetary must be made. While quantifying uncertainty has slowly becoming a norm in deep learning, no work has been dedicated in formulating the appropriate feature selection framework that lessens the prediction uncertainties. Much of the available techniques have only been proven to improve point estimate predictions, without considering its effect on uncertainty. In this paper, a feature selection method based on elimination of noisy data is proposed to reduce the Aleatoric uncertainty in a Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction problem. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) technique is employed to denoise sensor data in SVD matrix by filtering higher SVD modes susceptible to contain noise. Then, the “cleaned” Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of each feature is calculated and ranked. Features with low SNR, thus with higher noise, are eliminated. We compare the uncertainty level and behavior between a full feature dataset and different percentage of features selected using SVD and SNR. The same comparison is done between our approach and other feature selection methods such as Pearson and Spearman correlations as well as F Regression. The results show that our approach achieved a lower uncertainty degree with generally better prediction performance than the other mentioned methods. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2-s2.0-85142723234
"Precession Fault Diagnosis Method Based on Butterworth Filter and Convolutional Neural Network There is a rotating equipment that occasionally experiences abnormal precession during operation. This phenomenon may cause failure of rotating equipment. The identification of abnormal precession is mainly achieved by manually observing the damper spectrum.

To improve the performance of vertical channels, a novel multi-sensor altitude data fusion scheme named as fault-tolerant INS/BA/GNSS integration by means of chi-square test is developed. The system model of the proposed integrated navigation system is established based on 3rd order baro-inertial damping loop. Moreover, the altitude data of GNSS needs to be checked by the chi-square fault-detection before entering the integrated navigation. Finally, the simulation is conducted and the performance of fault-tolerant multi-sensor altitude data fusion scheme is compared with that of INS/BA/GNSS integration.

"Fault Tolerant Control of PMSM with Faulty Low Cost Hall-Effect Sensors A fault-tolerant control method which can achieve high reliability is proposed in this paper. In the traditional fault-tolerant control methods, average velocity method and acceleration method are not accurate enough to compensate and estimate hall sensor signals. Therefore, the fault diagnosis theory proposed in this paper is based on hall state and transition edge time, which can realize fast fault detection. For purpose of improving the precision of position estimation after fault tolerance, this paper proposes a position estimation method based on sliding-modeobserver (SMO) and an improved switch function.

"Rotor Unbalance Severity Detection Using Maximum Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform The rotor unbalances a critical fault that increases stress at rotational parts like bearings and gears, resulting in higher power consumption and early machinery wear. The general behavior of the vibration spectrum under this fault changes with strength and rotational speed. To address this problem, the presented work proposes frequency domain data fusion of vibration signals obtained from sensors placed at three different locations. The fused signal retains maximum spectral information, which decomposes into a multi-scale matrix using energy-preserving maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform. To analyze the severity of unbalance, the decomposed scale matrix is encoded into a contour plot using the mean absolute deviation of individual scales as iso-reference lines. Finally, a two-stage classification is performed using a convolutional neural network. The proposed method is tested using a publicly available dataset from Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits. The results show an overall classification accuracy of 97.05% for unbalance severity which is significantly better than other studies using single-sensor data. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2-s2.0-85185708089

"Service Migrations in TSCH Network using Wireless Channel Estimation and Prediction Industrial Wireless Sensors and Actuators Networks (IWSANs) are gateway to the Industrial 4.0, which promises to realize smart factory leading to the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). It employs Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) to enhance operational efficiency and flexibility while reducing cost. IWSANs are delay-sensitive and always require low latency and reliable connection from sensor to actuator to successfully perform a physical action. Reliability and low-latency complement each other to prevent expected failures in wireless medium. In this way, detecting and predicting failure before it actually occurs is key to actually avoid it well in time. Detection and predictions are imperative in locating faults and failures. The causes of failures in a sensor or actuator can include hardware malfunction, poor battery life, interference, accident, and short term wireless connectivity problems. Although, industrial environment mostly undertakes redundant resource to circumvent such issues, yet poor coordination among multiple resources and inaccurately predicting failures may result in losses. In such a scenario, migration of services come to be a rescue, where an intermediary can migrate service from one device, which cannot complete a task due to resource exhaustion, to a more resource-rich device. Thus, in this paper, we focus on wireless connectivity failures caused by interference in the 2.4GHz frequency band. We do it by designing an Multi Channel Sniffing Setup (MCSS) testbed, that acts as a spectrum observer and is deployed in different locations in industrial WSAN. Alongside, we use the concept of Cognitive Radio (CR) to predict interference and noise level in the spectrum by proposing an Intelligent Low-power Wireless Spectrum Prediction (ILPWSP) based on Deep Q Network (DQN). The MCSS testbed and the ILPWSP coordinate in assessing wireless connectivity risks, predict failures in sensor and actuator nodes and then make efficient decisions on the migration of services from one device to another device. Our results show the feasibility of spectrum prediction with an acceptable ratio for reliable IWSN. © 2020 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI). All rights reserved.",2-s2.0-85127328091

"A Novel Probabilistic Baseline Model Based on Diffusion for Diagnosis and Prognosis of Engine Bleed Air System The Engine Bleed Air(EBA) System is a critical component prone to failure in civil aviation aircraft. Failures of the EBA system can impact flight operations’ efficiency and pose potential safety risks, so it is necessary to conduct fault diagnosis and prediction. However, the existing data-driven methods for baseline prediction of EBA systems struggle to effectively capture the performance degradation process from real-world data, which can lead to inaccurate prediction and poor stability. So the existing methods still have limitations such as missed detections and false positives in practical applications. In response, we propose the diffusion baseline framework, renowned for its significant advancements in deep probability generation, to analyze EBA dataset. We introduce a concise overview of diffusion principles and its training process, employing this framework to model the probability distribution of sensor relationships under normal aircraft conditions. Our study includes a comparative analysis against conventional time series prediction methods and alternative probability prediction approaches on real aviation industry datasets, demonstrating the superior performance of probability prediction facilitated by the diffusion framework in EBA system.

"Reducing the Aleatoric Uncertainties of Failure Prediction Using Singular Value Decomposition Uncertainty is a vital indicator in evaluating the prediction of real-world deep learning models. Without uncertainty, important decision-making process linked to safety, security and investment cannot be executed correctly by the users. While probabilistic deep learning methods have shown promise in quantifying prediction uncertainty, very few works in managing these uncertainties can be found in the literature. In failure prediction especially, it is favourable that the model produces the lowest level of prediction uncertainty, i.e., the highest level of confidence in order to initiate any degree of problem-solving mechanism. In this work, we present a technique to reduce Aleatoric uncertainty associated with noisy data using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Sensor data from industrial assets are presented in SVD matrix form and higher SVD modes more susceptible to contamination are eliminated to denoise the data. We compare the uncertainty level between the original dataset with the ones denoised by SVD and several known denoising methods in a Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction problem. Our results show that SVD denoising treatment outperforms the other denoising methods in reducing prediction uncertainty and improving prediction performance. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2-s2.0-85142695581

This paper presents a research agenda aimed at enhancing DT interoperability grounded in four perspectives, which reflect knowledge fields in computer/information science, i.e., architecture of distributed systems, model-based system engineering, ontology-driven conceptual modeling, and linked data with semantic web. This paper highlights how leveraging on existing standards, such as modelling languages and ontologies, is important for improved DT interoperability. This becomes increasingly relevant for driving research directions related to ongoing initiatives such as the International Data Spaces and the Digital Product Passport. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",2-s2.0-85187785245
"NADA: NMF-Based Anomaly Detection in Adjacency-Matrices for Industrial Machine Log-Files In the manufacturing and process industries, the standard approach to detecting faults or anomalies in equipment is to use condition monitoring methods. The disadvantages of these approaches are the need for expensive sensor hardware and extensive knowledge of mechanical and electronic properties. Since these challenges are not always easy to overcome, we demonstrate a novel approach that allows us to monitor the behavior of industrial equipment based on regular logs with a moderate to low number of log entries. We propose a new approach for detecting anomalies and deviations in log files using the relative or power adjacency matrix of transitions based on non-negative matrix factorization. The experiments section discusses the application to a typical manufacturing process consisting of multiple processing steps and demonstrates the ability to detect regular and irregular machine behavior. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",2-s2.0-85202153737
"Predicting Physical Disturbances in Organic Computing Systems Using Automated Machine Learning Robustness against internal or external disturbances is a key competence of Organic Computing Systems. Hereby, a rarely discussed aspect are physical disturbances, therefore, failures or breakdowns that affect a systems physical components. Before experiencing such a disturbance, physical components may show various measurable signs of deterioration that might be assessed through sensor data. If interpreted correctly, it would be possible to predict future physical disturbances and act appropriately in order to prevent them from possibly harming the overall system. As the actual structure of such data as well as the behaviour that disturbances produce might not be known a priori, it is of interest to equip Organic Computing Systems with the ability to learn to predict them autonomously. We utilize the Automated Machine Learning Framework TPOT for an online-learning-inspired methodology for learning to predict physical disturbances in an iterative manner. We evaluate our approach using a freely available dataset from the broader domain of Predictive Maintenance research and show that our approach is able to build predictors with reasonable prediction quality autonomously. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85171459193
"Fault Detection Mechanisms for COTS FPGA Systems Used in Low Earth Orbit Field-programmable gate array (FPGAs) in space applications come with the drawback of radiation effects, which inevitably will occur in devices of small process size. This also applies to the electronics of the Bose Einstein Condensate and Cold Atom Laboratory (BECCAL) apparatus, which will operate on the International Space Station (ISS) for several years. A total of more than 100 FPGAs distributed throughout the setup will be used for high-precision control of specialized sensors and actuators at nanosecond scale. On ISS, radiation effects must be taken into account, the functionality of the electronics must be monitored, and errors must be handled properly. Due to the large number of devices in BECCAL, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) FPGAs are used, which are not radiation hardened. This paper describes the methods and measures used to mitigate the effects of radiation in an application specific COTS-FPGA-based communication network. Based on the firmware for a central communication network switch in BECCAL the steps are described to integrate redundancy into the design while optimizing the firmware to stay within the FPGA’s resource constraints. A redundant integrity checker module is developed that can notify preceding network devices of data and configuration bit errors. The firmware is validated and evaluated by injecting faults into data and configuration registers in simulation and real hardware. In the end, the FPGA resource usage of the firmware is reduced by more than half, enabling the use of dual modular redundancy (DMR) for the switching fabric. Together with the triple modular redundancy (TMR) protected integrity checker, this combination completely prevents silent data corruptions in the design as shown in simulation and by injecting faults into hardware using the Intel Fault Injection FPGA IP Core while staying within the resource limitation of a COTS FPGA. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",2-s2.0-85187706278
"Real-Time Equipment Health State Prediction with LSTM Networks and Bayesian Inference Due to the emergence of sensing technology, a large number of sensors is used to monitor the health state of manufacturing equipment, thus enhancing the capabilities of predicting abnormal behaviours in (near) real-time.

"Fault Diagnosis of Motor Bearing Based on Current Bi-Spectrum and Convolutional Neural Network Motor bearings are prone to different degrees of performance degradation, fatigue damage and failure undergoing complex and harsh environments. Vibration signal analysis is a mature method for diagnosing motor bearing faults, while it is not applicable for installing additional vibration sensors on many occasions. Practically, the fault of motor bearings changes the air gap flux between the rotor and stator, which leads to harmonic fluctuations in the stator current. The current signals can be used to diagnose the motor bearing faults without additional sensors. Inevitably the harmonics caused by the motor bearing faults will be coupled with the original signals. This paper combines bi-spectrum and Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to analyze the current signals of motor bearing faults. The CNN diagnosis model is trained based on the local bi-spectrum of current, and the CNN parameters are optimized.

"Siamese Networks for Unsupervised Failure Detection in Smart Industry In industrial production systems, detecting malfunctions or unexpected behavior in devices early is crucial to avoid critical situations for both production plants and workers. In this context, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection model that analyzes streaming data from IoT sensors installed on critical devices to identify abnormal behavior. Our model is based on a Siamese neural network, which embeds time series windows into a latent space, generating distance-based clusters representing normal behavior. We evaluate our model in a real case study focused on the predictive maintenance of elevators, where sensors measure lift oscillations during daily use.

"Predictive models for maintenance optimization: An analytical literature survey of industrial maintenance strategies As machine learning (ML) techniques and sensor technology continue to gain importance, the data-driven perspective has become a relevant approach for improving the quality of maintenance for machines and processes in industrial environments. Our study provides an analytical literature review of existing industrial maintenance strategies showing first that, among all extant approaches to maintenance, each varying in terms of efficiency and complexity, predictive maintenance best fits the needs of a highly competitive industry setup. Predictive maintenance is an approach that allows maintenance actions to be based on changes in the monitored parameters of the assets by using a variety of techniques to study both live and historical information to learn prognostic data and make accurate predictions. Moreover, we argue that, in any industrial setup, the quality of maintenance improves when the applied data-driven techniques and methods (i) have economic justifications and (ii) take into consideration the conformity with the industry standards. Next, we consider ML to be a prediction methodology, and we show that multimodal ML methods enhance industrial maintenance with a critical component of intelligence: prediction. Based on the surveyed literature, we introduce taxonomies that cover relevant predictive models and their corresponding data-driven maintenance techniques. Moreover, we investigate the potential of multimodality for maintenance optimization, particularly the model-agnostic data fusion methods.

"Gray Failures Detection for Shared Bicycles Today bicycle sharing system has been widely deployed around the world to provide a convenient transit connectivity for short trips. However, due to the careless usage or incident, it is inevitable to have some shared bicycles in the bad working condition. Rather than the fail-stop failure, e.g., a broken tire, which can be easily detected by users, the gray failure, i.e., subtle faults, can only be discovered when riding the bike. Such gray failure causes bad user experience and affects the reputation of bicycle sharing system provider. Unfortunately, it is not easy to detect these gray failures. Current solution to this problem mainly relies on users’ self-reporting. However, due to the lack of incentive mechanism and the knowledge on bicycle, cyclists may submit inaccurate report or ignore the subtle faults. To provide users the working condition of bicycles in advance and reduce the maintaining cost of system providers, this paper introduces an approach to automatically detect the gray failures of the shared bicycles. To this end, we leverage the smartphone to collect and analyze the data collected from the sensor-equipped bicycle. We extract patterns from sensing signals of broken bikes, and identify the problematic components of shared bicycles. Compared with the conventional user-reporting, the proposed method is cost-effective, automatic, and easy-to-deploy. Extensive experiments based on real bicycle sharing systems show that the proposed method achieves high accuracy in determining gray failures for a variety of scenarios. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85115395861
"Autonomous Early Warning System for Monitoring Critical Infrastructure Elements Using Smart Multi-sensors Monitoring and managing the health of critical structures has been identified as a key approach to define performance parameters in realizing the next generation of industrial manufacturing, production and operation (Industry 4.0 principles in Europe). However, stakeholders today are facing challenges in handling the data acquired from the sensors along with the complexities in post processing for improved productivity and safety standards. Although the currently available state-of-the-art sensors are capable of collection and communication of structural health related aspects, the complexity associated with the data processing scheme and effective wireless transmission of large data-volumes for real-time decision making hinders its value-add for industrial applications. In this context, we propose an early warning system, using smart multi-sensors, with the capability for on-board processing and data logging. Although the developed system could be applied for a wide variety of use-cases, across several industries (including aerospace, automotive and marine), we employ the same for monitoring the health of critical infrastructure elements in this study.

"Federated Learning for Anomaly Detection in Industrial IoT-enabled Production Environment Supported by Autonomous Guided Vehicles Intelligent production requires maximum downtime avoidance since downtimes lead to economic loss. Thus, Industry 4.0 (today’s IoT-driven industrial revolution) is aimed at automated production with real-time decision-making and maximal uptime. To achieve this, new technologies such as Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGVs) are integrated into production to optimize and automate many production processes. The increasing use of AGVs in production has far-reaching consequences for industrial communication systems. To make AGVs in production even more effective, we propose to use Federated Learning (FL) which provides a secure exchange of experience between intelligent manufacturing devices to improve prediction accuracy.

"Acoustic Features and Autoencoders for Fault Detection in Rotating Machines: A Case Study Traditional Machine Fault Detection (MFD) techniques usually rely on multiple sensor data sources, such as vibration, temperature, force, and audio/acoustic signals. Acoustic signals, in particular, are quite appealing in the context of MFD, as they are often among the first manifestations of machine failure. Furthermore, they are associated with high sensitivity, environmental resilience, and do not require machine interference. Given these compelling characteristics, MFD based exclusively on acoustic signals can be highly beneficial. In this work, we evaluate an unsupervised MFD approach based on Autoencoders (AE) trained exclusively on features extracted from acoustic signals of a rotating machine. The data employed in this work comes from the Machine Fault Database (MaFaulDa), which includes information from vibration and velocity sensors, besides the acoustic measurements. This allows us to compare the performance of the AE models to that of supervised models (such as MLPs) trained on the same acoustic-based feature set, as well as feature sets that incorporate all sensors from MaFaulDa. Our results support that unsupervised MFD based on Autoencoders and acoustic signals is particularly appealing, as it requires only normal machine operation for training. Indeed, we obtained AUC values of 0.86 for the task. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",2-s2.0-85219210636
"Remaining Useful Life Estimation Using a Recurrent Variational Autoencoder A new framework for the assessment of Engine Health Monitoring (EHM) data in aircraft is proposed. Traditionally, prognostics and health management systems rely on prior knowledge of the degradation of certain components along with professional expert opinion to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL). In order to avoid reliance on this process while still providing an accurate diagnosis, a data-driven approach using a novel recurrent version of a VAE is introduced. The latent space learned by this model, trained with the historical data recorded by the sensors embedded in these engines, is used to visually evaluate the deterioration progress of the engines. High prognostic accuracy in estimating the RUL is achieved by building a simple classifier on top of the learned features of the VAE. The superiority of the proposed method is compared with other popular and state-of-the-art approaches using Rolls Royce Turbofan engine data. The results of this study suggest that the proposed data-driven prognostic and explainable framework offers a new and promising approach. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85115849717
"Fault Detection and Identification on Pneumatic Production Machine Pneumatic cylinders have become integral parts of today’s production machinery. In the age of just-in-time inventory system and with it the related production process, new, increased requirements were introduced. As a result, even the smallest fault in the system can lead to degradation in the product’s quality in addition to this it can cause unplanned downtime leading to delays in production, not to mention higher costs. The availability of cheap sensors, big data, and algorithms from the field of predictive maintenance made the aforementioned problem tractable. This paper examines whether signal-based condition indicators provide commercially viable and affordable basis for development of a health monitoring system for pneumatic actuator-based production machinery. The experiments and their results presented in this paper served two objectives. The first was to examine if faults on such equipment can be detected. The second was to identify the best combination of sensors, which are able to detect and identify fault with required accuracy.

"Digital Twin-Based Fault Detection and Prioritisation in District Heating Systems: A Case Study in Denmark Faults in district heating systems (DHS) cause sub-optimal operating conditions, which increase energy losses. As DHSs are critical infrastructure for many households in Denmark, these faults should be detected and corrected quickly. A novel model-based fault detection and diagnosis framework has been applied to detect and prioritise faults. The framework uses a bound for normal operation based on the residuals between historical sensor data and simulated properties in a digital twin of the DHS. The faults detected are prioritised based on the fault probability calculated using the Chernoff bound method. A case study on a Danish DHS has proven that the framework can produce a prioritised list of faults that maintenance crews can use to target faults with the highest probability. Furthermore, the digital twin allowed for fault location investigation, which could correlate different faults in the DHS. The framework has the potential for real-time fault detection and diagnosis. However, more precise digital twins need to be developed. © The Author(s).",2-s2.0-85194701288
"Towards a Novel Maintenance Support System Based On mini-terms: Mini-term 4.0 This paper presents how to design a novel Maintenance Support System (MSS) to prognostic breakdowns in production lines based on mini-terms, well known as a Mini-term 4.0. The system is based on the real time sub-cycle time (mini-term) monitorization and how the mini-term variability can be used as a fault detection indicator. Mini-terms and micro-terms were introduced in our previous work as a machine subdivision. A mini-term subdivision can be selected by the expert team for several reasons, the replacement of a machine part or simply to analyze the machine more adequately. (A micro-term is a component from a mini-term and it can be as small as the user wishes. Mini-terms are able to detect the same physical deterioration phenomenon than common sensor but with an important advantage, it is easy and cheap to install. It is cheap because do not require any additional hardware installation to measure the sub-cycle time, just use the PLC and sensors installed for the automated production process, and easy because only requires to code extra timers into the PLC. Mini-terms are nowadays implanted at Ford factories around the world where a learning process is established to enrich the knowledge of the system.

"Study and Instrumental Monitoring of Landslides at the “Russkie Gorki” Site in the Mzymta River Valley, Sochi Region, Russia Northern slope of the Aibga Ridge, forming the left-bank slope of the Mzymta River valley, is one of the most landslide-prone areas of the Sochi region. The landslide site “Russkie Gorki” lies in the valley of the Mzymta left tributary and has an elevation range of 700 m and even more. The lower and middle part of the slope is composed of Lower Jurassic terrigenous flysch divided by tectonic fault from Middle Jurassic volcanoclastic sediments developed at the upper part of the slope. The region is seismically prone to high intensity of the anticipated strong motion. Several types of landslides are widespread in the study area. Among them are large-scale rock avalanches that had originated at the upper part of the slopes composed of the porphyry and reach the slope’s base; besides, there are variable landslides in the terrigenous flysch. Landslides distribution was studied by compilation of the detailed DEM that helped reconstruct the development of the landslide processes in the study area in Late Quaternary time. Instrumental monitoring systems were installed, including inclinometers, extensometers, piezometers, and pressure sensors at the lower parts of the slope where the most active landslides exist. It allowed to specify the sliding surface depth and reveal the main factors affecting slopes’ stability. It was found that the landslide array on the site “Russkie Gorki” has a three-tiered structure. The inclinometric observations for 106 days result showed that the average landslide displacement rates at the “Russkie Gorki” site of landslide rupture ranged from 0.16–0.26 mm/day to 0.55 mm/day in lower and upper, respectively. The present study concluded that the instrumental monitoring technique is effective for the detection of real-time landslide scenario at the site. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023",2-s2.0-85171007820
"Neural Network Based Approaches for Fault Diagnosis of Photovoltaic Systems Faults in photovoltaic (PV) systems due to manufacturing defects and normal wear and tear are practically unavoidable. The effects thereof range from minor energy losses to risk of fire and electrical shock. Thus, several PV fault diagnosis techniques have been developed, usually based on dedicated on-site sensors or high-frequency current and voltage measurements. Yet, implementing them is not economically viable for common small-scale residential systems. Hence, we focus on cost-effective techniques that enable introducing fault diagnosis without incurring costs for on-site sensor systems. In this chapter, we will present in particular two machine-learning-based approaches, built on recent neural network models. The first technique relies on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) using satellite weather data and low-frequency inverter measurements for accurate fault detection, including severity estimation (i.e., the power loss caused by the fault, usually not quantified in state-of-the-art methods in literature). The second technique is based on graph neural networks (GNNs), which we use to monitor a group of PV systems by comparing their current and voltage production over the last 24 h. By comparing outputs from multiple (geographically nearby) PV installations, we avoid any need for additional sensor data. Moreover, our results suggest that the GNN-based model can generalize to PV systems it was not trained on (as long as nearby sites are available) and retains high accuracy when multiple PV systems are simultaneously affected by faults. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",2-s2.0-85183873096

"A Fault Detection Framework Based on LSTM Autoencoder: A Case Study for Volvo Bus Data Set This study applies a data-driven anomaly detection framework based on a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder network for several subsystems of a public transport bus. The proposed framework efficiently detects abnormal data, significantly reducing the false alarm rate compared to available alternatives. Using historical repair records, we demonstrate how detection of abnormal sequences in the signals can be used for predicting equipment failures. The deviations from normal operation patterns are detected by analysing the data collected from several on-board sensors (e.g., wet tank air pressure, engine speed, engine load) installed on the bus. The performance of LSTM autoencoder (LSTM-AE) is compared against the multi-layer autoencoder (mlAE) network in the same anomaly detection framework.

"Bridging the Gap Between Data and Outliers: Using Machine Learning to Automate Outlier Sensor Behaviour for Bridge Structural Health Monitoring Structural health monitoring (SHM) is a process where a system is monitored over time through periodically recorded system response measurements related to changes in material and geometric properties. SHM aims to provide accurate and just-in-time information concerning structural conditions and performance through the recording of representative parameters over the short or long term. A proper SHM system can give an owner better knowledge of the structural conditions in real time, facilitating a better-educated approach to planning maintenance activities which may prolong the structure’s service life beyond the design life, and decrease potential future major repair costs. Advances in structural monitoring enable the collection of large data sets from strain gauges for usable information. However, making sense of these data remains a challenge. In addition to complexities with working with time series data and considering seasonality effects, the sensors are exposed to harsh environmental conditions, which can impact the accuracy and validity of recorded results. In this research, data collected from a steel truss cantilever bridge in Canada, ON, were used as a case study to propose an automated workflow for sensor data outlier detection. Thirty-five (35) weldable strain gauges, having a nickel–chromium alloy grid encapsulated in fibreglass-reinforced epoxy phenolic, were placed along the bridge, where data were collected every one (1) minute for a two (2)-year period. Using Python3, input data were transformed into features for a fitted classification machine learning model to identify outlier periods. The results were cross-validated using a time series CV fold strategy to assess the model’s predictive power whilst also considering environmental effects. To perform SHM accurately, it is important to implement processes which can capture when there are anomalies in the sensor data quality. Ontario has over 15,500 bridges as of 2020, the most out of any province, with another ~ 500 bridge projects currently in construction.

"Feature Selection for Aero-Engine Fault Detection Timely and accurate detection of aero-engine faults is crucial to preventing loss of lives and equipment. In recent times, there has been a focus on data-driven approaches to fault detection in aero-engines owing to the availability of numerous sensor information which addresses the complexities of model-based techniques. However, the increased use of sensors in aero-engines induces problems relating to multicollinearity and high dimensionality in developing fault detection models. Various feature selection approaches have been proposed for tackling dimensionality problems, with each offering advantages based on the peculiarity of the data. This study, therefore, investigates the use of feature-selection approaches to address the dimensionality problems associated with aero-engine data.

"Demagnetization fault diagnosis in bldc motor using low-cost hall effect sensors This paper proposes a demagnetization fault diagnostic method for a brushless direct current (BLDC) motor using Hall effect (HE) sensor sequence. The low-cost Hall effect sensors positioned 120° apart are used on the stator of a BLDC motor in order to monitor the change in the sequence during demagnetization fault conditions. Demagnetization effect in the permanent magnets (PMs) can be due to various causes; however, the broken PM defects are taken in our study. In contrary to the healthy operation of the motor, the significant change observed in the Hall sequence pattern during the demagnetization fault conditions is used as the fault signatures in this study. The change in machine quantities in terms of phase currents and magnetic flux density (BM) characteristics is investigated numerically through a developed co-simulation model of a BLDC motor with the Simplorer drive circuit in Maxwell 2D tool. The numerically obtained results are validated experimentally, and the change in Hall sequence signals is investigated in order to detect, diagnose and identify the demagnetization fault in the BLDC motor. The diagnosis of the broken PM demagnetization fault using the low-cost Hall sensor’s sequence is the novel contribution to this work. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.",2-s2.0-85089617526
"A Well Lubricated Machine: A Data Driven Model for Lubricant Oil Conditions Diagnostic and predictive failure processes based on intelligent lubricant oil analysis are a important of the condition-based maintenance (CBM) approaches for diesel vehicle fleets. Companies are equipping each vehicle in the fleet with a large number of sensors, which allows the collection of vast amounts of data about the current state of each asset. With all this information now allows for the research and development of predictive models to help a fleet manager make informed decisions about the operating condition of the vehicles. This allows companies to accurately identify the state of wear and tear of a piece of equipment or system, making CBM more effective and reliable. In this paper we present a supervised machine learning framework based on the Random Forest Classifier (RF) to determine the operating condition of lubricant oil in diesel engines based on data from 5 different vehicles. We describe the how practitioners should collect and process data, and which features can be engineered to help describe the state of the lubrication system. This data will then be used by a RF model to determine the operational condition of the lubricating oil. The results presented show that the proposed approach is able to successfully identify the oil operating conditions, with the predictive model obtaining a Recall of 97.9%, a Precision of 99.5% and a F1-score of 98.7%. In addition, we evaluate the importance is the inclusion of new engineered features projected from raw data for better determination of the operating condition. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85115448668
"Ambient Temperature Prediction for Embedded Systems Using Machine Learning In this work, we use two well-established machine learning algorithms i.e., Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost, to predict ambient temperature for a baseband’s board. After providing an overview of the related work, we describe how we train the two ML models and identify the optimal training and test datasets to avoid the problems of data under- and over-fitting. Given this train/test split, the trained RF and XGBoost models provide temperature predictions with an accuracy lower than one degree Celsius, i.e., far better than any other approach that we used in the past. Our feature importance assessments reveal that the temperature sensors contribute significantly more towards predicting the ambient temperature compared to the power and voltage readings. Furthermore, the RF model appears less volatile than XGBoost using our training data. As the results demonstrate, our predictive temperature models allow for an accurate error prediction as a function of baseband board sensors. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85180147389

"Multi-level Fault Tolerance Approach for IoT Systems The presence of faults is inevitable in the Internet of Things (IoT) systems. However, fault Tolerance in IoT systems is a challenge to overcome due to their size, complexity, dynamicity, and level of heterogeneity, especially error detection and error recovery and continued service. Thus, it is impractical to consider a unified fault tolerance technique for an entire system. The purpose of this study is to propose a multi-level fault tolerance approach granting interconnection among IoT system levels allowing information exchange and collaboration in order to attain the dependability property. Therefore, we define an event-driven framework called FaTEMa (Fault Tolerance Event Manager), creating a dedicated fault-related communication channel to propagate events among system levels. The implemented framework acted to assist error detection and continued service. Also, it offers extension points to support heterogeneous communication protocols and evolves to new capabilities. Our empirical results show that the FaTEMa introduction has improved error detection and error resolution time, consequently improving system availability. In addition, the use of FaTEMa demonstrates a reliability improvement and a reduction in the number of failures produced. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85115674961

"Tool Wear State Monitoring Based on Long-Term and Short-Term Memory Neural Network The real-time detection of tool wear condition is the difficult point of machine tool processing status monitoring. The vibration signal of tool wear shows strong nonlinear and non-stationary phenomenon. The neural network model can be used to analyze the vibration signal of the tool to judge the wear state of the tool. To this end, an online monitoring method for tool wear status based on long-term and short-term memory neural network (LSTM) is proposed. Firstly, the tool vibration signal is collected by the acceleration sensor, and then the vibration signal is decomposed by wavelet packet transform to form the energy value corresponding to different frequency bands, which is used as the feature vector input of the long-term and short-term memory neural network. Finally, the long-short-term memory neural network model is used to process the tool vibration signal to judge the wear condition of the tool. In addition, the method is compared with BP neural network and multi-layer BP neural network fault diagnosis method.

"Visual Interactive Exploration and Labeling of Large Volumes of Industrial Time Series Data In recent years, supervised machine learning models have become increasingly important for the advancing digitalization of the manufacturing industry. Reports from research and application show potentials in the use for application scenarios, such as predictive quality or predictive maintenance, that promise flexibility and savings. However, such data-based learning methods require a large training sets of accurately labeled sensor data that represents the manufacturing process in the digital world and allow model to learn corresponding behavioral patterns. Nevertheless, the creation of these data sets cannot be fully automated and requires the knowledge of process experts to interpret the sensor curves. Consequently, the creation of such a data set is time-consuming and expensive for the companies. Existing solutions do not meet the needs of the manufacturing industry as they cannot visualize large data sets, do not support all common sensor data forms and offer little support for efficient labeling of large data volumes. In this paper, we build on our previously presented visual interactive labeling tool Gideon-TS that is designed for handling large data sets of industrial sensor data in multiple modalities (univariate, multivariate, segments or whole time series, with and without timestamps). Gideon-TS also features an approach for semi-automatic labeling that reduces the time needed to label large volumes of data. Based on the requirements of a new use case, we extend the capabilities of our tool by improving the aggregation functionality for visualizing large data queries and by adding support for small time units. We also improve our labeling support system with an active learning component to further accelerate the labeling process. We evaluate the extended version of Gideon-TS on two industrial exemplary use cases by conducting performance tests and by performing a user study to show that our tool is suitable for labeling large volumes of industrial sensor data and significantly reduces labeling time compared to traditional labeling methods. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",2-s2.0-85172735051
"Predictive Maintenance, Adversarial Autoencoders and Explainability The transition to Industry 4.0 provoked a transformation of industrial manufacturing with a significant leap in automation and intelligent systems. This paradigm shift has brought about a mindset that emphasizes predictive maintenance: detecting future failures when current behaviour of industrial processes and machines is thought to be normal. The constant monitoring of industrial equipment produces massive quantities of data that enables the application of machine learning approaches to this task. This study uses deep learning-based models to build a data-driven predictive maintenance framework for the air production unit (APU), a crucial system for the proper functioning of a Metro do Porto train. This public transport system moves thousands of people every day and train failures lead to delays and loss of trust by clients. Therefore, it is essential not only to detect APU failures before they occur to minimize negative impacts, but also to provide explanations for the failure warnings that can aid in decision-making processes. We propose an autoencoder architecture trained with an adversarial loss, known as the Wasserstein Autoencoder with Generative Adversarial Network (WAE-GAN), designed to detect sensor failures in systems connected to the APU. Our model can detect APU failures up to two hours before they occur, allowing timely intervention of the maintenance teams. We further augment our model with an explainability layer, by providing explanations generated by a rule-based model that focuses on rare events. Results show that our model is able to detect APU failures without any false alarms, fulfilling the requisites of Metro do Porto for early detection of the failures. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85174438688
"Background noise assessment of low-cost vibration sensors in precision manufacturing applications Accurate, reliable, and consistent vibration measurements in manufacturing machines such as machine tools, form the basis for predictive maintenance and condition monitoring applications Recent advancements in Micro ElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) has led to a rapid adoption of low-cost industrial grade MEMS vibration sensors in contrast to traditional high-cost Integrated Electronics Piezo-Electric (IEPE) accelerometers which have been typically used in precision manufacturing setups. However, low-cost MEMS accelerometers are subject to various deterministic and stochastic noise phenomenon which often limits their performance especially when subject to low acceleration conditions. Preliminary work has been performed for characterization of baseline errors and uncertainties of such low-cost triaxial vibration sensors to evaluate their viability in metrological applications for Industry 4.0. However, employment of low-cost MEMS sensors for long term vibration measurements requires assessment and quantification of time dependent progression of the noise and its effect. Methods such as Allan Variance which are based on regression analysis of entire time-domain sensor data provide effective modelling and systematic assessment of background noise in MEMS based sensors in accordance with IEEE 1293-2018 standard. To evaluate the background noise in these low-cost industrial MEMS sensors, continuous long-term data was recorded on a vibrationally stable test bed while establishing traceability according to the ISO 16063-11:1999 and ISO 16063-21:2003 standards. Linear accelerometer analysis was conducted to quantify and characterize various types of noise and random effects contributing to the sensor measurements while ensuring input to the setup is lower than intrinsic noise of the sensors. This work attempts to model noise parameters of low-cost MEMS vibration sensors to mitigate the baseline errors and random noise for employment in industrial manufacturing setups and smart condition monitoring applications. Results from this study will offer an improved framework for sensor stability through obtaining a low noise floor by a careful consideration of underlying random processes within metrology applications. © 2021 Laser Metrology and Machine Performance XIV - 14th International Conference and Exhibition on Laser Metrology, Machine Tool, CMM and Robotic Performance, LAMDAMAP 2021.

"Robot Predictive Maintenance Method Based on Program-Position Cycle A condition monitoring method of industrial robot based on program-position cycle is proposed to serve predictive maintenance. In this method, actual working conditions in factory is taken as the background. The data is processed according to the robot program-position cycle: the sequence of the robot position in each program is used as the periodic index, to avoid program-time cycle differences due to waiting signals. Data is processed in path segments of each robot motion command instead of each position point to reduce the amount of calculations. Take the axis current monitoring as an example, a reference range of current of each axis in each path section is constructed with the suitable percentile form historical data under normal working conditions. The change of the current relative to the reference range is recognized, and the proportion of data exceeding the range is calculated, and an alarm is issued accordingly. No extra sensor or extra testing time is needed in this method. The validity of the algorithm is verified by failure cases in factory conditions. The verification results show that the method can serve predictive maintenance for a variety of mechanical failures.

"Integration of COTS Processing Architectures in Small Satellites for Onboard Computing Using Fault Injection Testing Methodology Over the last decade, the interest of the space industry has increased towards smaller missions with reduced instruments. Advances in miniaturization technologies for electronics have increased the development of small spacecrafts, such as nanosatellites and microsatellites, from commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) devices of low size, weight, and power. However, the effects of harsh space environment conditions on COTS electronic devices limit their use in high-performance multicore and heterogenous architectures, such as onboard edge computing based on Graphics Processing Units (GPU) for Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications.

At first, several pieces of white noise data are randomly generated, and each piece of white noise data is applied as a ground pulsation excitation to the structure support, and the acceleration response of the structure at the sensor location is calculated. Simultaneously, each structural response record of each sensor adds white noise with the same signal-to-noise ratio to obtain the test value of each sensor; Secondly, in order to study the generality, except for the five types of faulty sensors in sequence, one sensor is randomly selected from each of the remaining spans, to verify whether there will be a situation where an intact sensor is misdiagnosed as a faulty sensor; Finally, the FS-LSTM network is constructed through the training set to predict the acceleration data, determine the sensor fault threshold, and compare the residual sequence with the fault threshold to diagnose whether the sensor is faulty.

When the monitored surface or structure vibrates, the stress of PMF will change and the Sagnac interference spectrum will be shifted, so that the vibration can be measured. The fabrication technology of sensor based on 3D printing is studied, and the structural parameters of the sensor are optimized through experiments and theoretical analysis. A vibration detection system and a rolling bearing vibration test platform based on SI and fiber ring laser are built. The experimental results show that the relative error between the experimental and theoretical results of healthy and faulty bearings is less than 1.60%, and the fault detection of bearings is realized. Temperature cross-sensitivity and stability of the sensing system are analyzed. The sensor has the advantages of simple structure, easy fabrication, anti-interference, etc, and has wide application prospects in engineering, machinery, security and other fields. © 2023 Astro Ltd.",2-s2.0-85152773738
"Interpretable Remaining Useful Life Prediction Based on Causal Feature Selection and Deep Learning Robust feature selection is crucial for enhancing the credibility and interpretability of machine learning models. Traditionally, deep learning networks directly learn features from raw data. However, the multidimensional data collected by sensors in dynamic systems may contain redundancy, noise, and high dimensionality, making it challenging to select the optimal feature set. To tackle this concern, we introduce a feature selection prediction framework based on causal discovery algorithms. It first identifies key features and learns their causal relationships, providing more interpretable and effective features. Subsequently, deep learning models are employed for prediction. This paper introduces a long short-term memory model that incorporates causal discovery and attention mechanisms. Our framework is applied to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) on the C-MAPSS dataset, demonstrating that causal feature selection contributes to the enhanced reliability, interpretability, and generalization of the RUL prediction model. Our approach outperforms traditional feature-unselected algorithms in terms of both generalization performance and interpretability. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",2-s2.0-85201227395
"Multivariate Time-Series Anomaly Detection with Temporal Self-supervision and Graphs: Application to Vehicle Failure Prediction Failure prediction is key to ensuring the reliable operation of vehicles, especially for organizations that depend on a fleet of vehicles. However, traditional approaches often rely on rule-based or heuristic methods that may not be effective in detecting subtle anomalies, rare events, or in more modern vehicles containing a complex sensory network. This paper presents a novel approach to vehicle failure prediction, called mVSG-VFP, which employs self-supervised learning and graph-based techniques. The proposed method realizes the failure prediction task by exploring information hidden in the time-series data recorded through the sensors embedded in the vehicle. mVSG-VFP includes two main components: a graph-based autoencoder that learns representations of normal data while considering the relationship between different sensors and a self-supervised component that maps temporally-adjacent data to similar representations. We propose a novel approach to define the notion of adjacency in vehicle temporal data. To evaluate mVSG-VFP, we apply it to a dataset comprised of vehicle sensor recordings to identify the abnormal data samples that signal a potential future failure. We performed a flurry of experiments to verify the accuracy of our model and demonstrate it outperforms state-of-the-art models in this task. Overall, the method is robust and intuitive, making it a useful tool for real-world applications. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85174449229
"Combining Autoencoder with Similarity Measurement for Aircraft Engine Remaining Useful Life Estimation Remaining useful life (RUL) estimation is very important for the maintenance of aircraft engines. We can evaluate the current condition of an aircraft engine and predict its RUL by constructing its degradation curve. However, the degradation curve is often difficult to obtain due to the unobserved degradation patterns. Currently, many researchers estimated RUL by setting a fixed RUL target function or making assumptions about how an engine degrades. But in the real world, degradation models of aircraft engines are generally individualized. To obtain personalized degradation curves and predict RUL accurately, we propose a method based on autoencoder and similarity measurement. First, an autoencoder trained with normal data is adopted to extract degradation curves of aircraft engines and build a degradation model template library. Then, we measure each test object with all template curves to get similarities and corresponding RULs based on a sliding window and complexity-invariant distance. At last, the estimated RUL can be obtained by calculating the weighted average of highly relevant corresponding RULs. We conduct the proposed method on the aircraft engine dataset provided by NASA. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can utilize the information of multi-sensor data to generate personalized degradation curves effectively and estimate RUL more accurately. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2-s2.0-85081678911
"Exploiting Context and Attention Using Recurrent Neural Network for Sensor Time Series Prediction In the current era of Internet of Things, typically data from multiple sources are captured through various sensors yielding Multivariate Time Series (MTS) data. Sensor MTS prediction has several real-life applications in various domains such as healthcare, manufacturing, and agriculture. In this paper, we propose a novel Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture that leverages contextual information and attention mechanism for sensor MTS prediction. We adopt the notion of primary and contextual features to distinguish between the features that are independently useful for learning irrespective of other features, and the features that are not useful in isolation. The contextual information is represented through the contextual features and when used with primary features can potentially improve the performance of the model. The proposed architecture uses the contextual features in two ways. Firstly, to weight the primary input features depending on the context, and secondly to weight the hidden states in the alignment model. The latter is used to compute the dependencies between hidden states (representations) to derive the attention vector. Further, integration of the context and attention allows visualising temporally and spatially the relevant parts of the input sequence which are influencing the prediction. To evaluate the proposed architecture, we used two benchmark datasets as they provide contextual information. The first is NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation dataset for estimating Remaining Useful Life, and the second is appliances energy prediction dataset. We compared the proposed approach with the state-of-the-art methods and observed improved prediction results, particularly with respect to the first dataset. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85180735386
"A Deep Correlation Feature Extraction Network: Intelligent Description of Bearing Fault Knowledge for Zero-Sample Learning In zero-shot learning for bearing fault diagnosis, it is crucial to provide an accurate description of fault attributes. However, the existing fault attribute descriptions depend on manual definitions, which is labor-intensive and may not be very accurate. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop an automated system for adaptive attribute description. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a domain knowledge-driven intelligent description method for bearing fault attributes, that is, a deep correlation feature extraction network for automatic definition of attributes in zero-shot fault diagnosis tasks. Fault attribute descriptions are generated by extracting periodic components of deep features using correlation analysis operations and performing residual processing with the original feature tensor to extract periodic feature components related to faults. Additionally, a constraint function for correlation feature extraction is designed to assist deep learning networks in capturing periodic features and automatically completing the description of fault knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately extract periodic components from bearing vibration sensor signals, automatically describe fault attributes, and play a significant role in advancing zero-shot learning tasks. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",2-s2.0-85200738276
"Model-Centered Assurance for Autonomous Systems The functions of an autonomous system can generally be partitioned into those concerned with perception and those concerned with action. Perception builds and maintains an internal model of the world (i.e., the system’s environment) that is used to plan and execute actions to accomplish a goal established by human supervisors. Accordingly, assurance decomposes into two parts: a) ensuring that the model is an accurate representation of the world as it changes through time and b) ensuring that the actions are safe (and effective), given the model. Both perception and action may employ AI, including machine learning (ML), and these present challenges to assurance. However, it is usually feasible to guard the actions with traditionally engineered and assured monitors, and thereby ensure safety, given the model. Thus, the model becomes the central focus for assurance. We propose an architecture and methods to ensure the accuracy of models derived from sensors whose interpretation uses AI and ML. Rather than derive the model from sensors bottom-up, we reverse the process and use the model to predict sensor interpretation. Small prediction errors indicate the world is evolving as expected and the model is updated accordingly. Large prediction errors indicate surprise, which may be due to errors in sensing or interpretation, or unexpected changes in the world (e.g., a pedestrian steps into the road). The former initiate error masking or recovery, while the latter requires revision to the model. Higher-level AI functions assist in diagnosis and execution of these tasks. Although this two-level architecture where the lower level does “predictive processing” and the upper performs more reflective tasks, both focused on maintenance of a world model, is derived by engineering considerations, it also matches a widely accepted theory of human cognition. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85090096793
"The Pathology of Failures in IoT Systems The presence of faults is inevitable in the Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Dependability in these systems is challenging due to the increasing level of dynamicity, heterogeneity, and complexity. IoT connects anything, anytime, and everywhere, introducing a complex relationship of interdependence, generating an increase in the susceptibility of the propagation of failures. The purpose of this study is to propose a pathology of failure in IoT Systems, exploring and characterizing faults, errors, failures, and their effects. This study investigates and classifies the source of faults, defines a taxonomy of the types of faults prone to happen, and defines the failure propagation model. As a result, the pathology establishes a common reference for fault, errors, and failures to be used by researchers and practitioners to improve tools for fault detection, fault diagnosis, fault tolerance, and fault handling in IoT Systems. This paper also proposes a failure propagation model for IoT systems that identify different combinations, paths, and fault-failure propagation effects. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85115733369
"Federated Dynamic Graph Fusion Framework for Remaining Useful Life Prediction In real scenarios, due to the limitation of data silos, it is difficult to perform collaborative training with sparse and heterogeneous data distributed in different factories. Besides, the complex operating conditions of equipment result in dynamic interactions among sensors, which diminishes the effectiveness of local models, and different sensor types and numbers between clients also hinder collaborative training. These problems are particularly significant in the remaining useful life (RUL) prediction task, which is essential for modern engineering to maintain high reliability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Federated Dynamic Correlation-Aware (FDCA) framework, which generates global graph structure knowledge to enhance local model training and utilizes dynamic graphs to incorporate spatio-temporal features on the client side to improve prediction accuracy and robustness, maximizing the synergy between local data training and global knowledge inspiration. Extensive experiments conducted on four public sub-datasets show the advantages of our proposed FDCA over state-of-the-art baselines. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",2-s2.0-85210180352

"Taking Care of Our Drinking Water: Dealing with Sensor Faults in Water Distribution Networks The water supply is part of the critical infrastructure as the accessibility of clean drinking water is essential to ensure the health of the people. To guarantee the availability of fresh water, efficient and reliable water distribution networks are crucial. Monitoring these systems is necessary to avoid deterioration in water quality, deal with leakages and prevent cyber-physical attacks. While the installation of a growing amount of sensors is increasing the possibilities to monitor the system, considering the control of the senors becomes another challenge as sensor faults negatively influence the reliability of systems dealing with leakages and monitoring water quality. In this work, we aim to overcome the negative implications induced by sensor faults by using a sensor fault monitoring system based on three steps.

"Design of a Subsurface Heat Detection System in the Geothermal Area of Lokop, Aceh, Indonesia Geothermal energy encompasses the heat stored within rocks and fluids beneath the Earth’s surface. Recognized as a renewable and environmentally friendly natural resource, geothermal heat has emerged as a crucial alternative energy source that demands development to generate electricity and foster the expansion of Indonesia’s power sector. An initial survey identifies potential geothermal areas by observing surface manifestations of geothermal activity. For instance, the village of Lokop in East Aceh Regency displays geothermal potential, marked by the presence of hot springs. However, insufficient research, especially in geophysical measurements, has been conducted in this location. Consequently, a comprehensive study is imperative to maximize the existing resource potential. The initial geophysical study can be conducted by analyzing the temperature distribution beneath the surface of the geothermal manifestation area. Temperature measurements beneath the Earth’s surface can be performed using DS18B20 temperature sensors, which are configured with microcontroller programming to read and transmit data to a server through the Internet of Things (IoT) approach. This ensures that the measured temperature data can be accessed in real-time by users. From the results of the conducted research, information related to the heat distribution at the Lokop hot spring source has been obtained. The heat distribution is directed towards the northwest of the research location. This heat distribution aligns with the direction of fault lines, including the Terujak, Leles, and Ujung Karang faults, which extend from the northwest to the southeast. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.",2-s2.0-105010576783
"Road Infrastructure Monitoring: An Experimental Geomatic Integrated System Road infrastructures systems are critical in many regions of Italy, counting thousands of bridges and viaducts that were built over several decades. A monitoring system is therefore necessary to monitor the health of these bridges and to indicate whether they need maintenance. Different parameters affect the health of an infrastructure, but it would be very difficult to install a network of sensors of various kinds on each viaduct. For this purpose, we want to finalize the use of geomatics technologies to monitor infrastructures for early warning issues and introducing automations in the data acquisition and processing phases. This study describes an experimental sensor network system, based on long term monitoring in real-time while an adaptive neuro-fuzzy system is used to predict the deformations of GPS-bridge monitoring points. The proposed system integrates different data (used to describe the various behaviour scenarios on the structural model), and then it reworks them through machine learning techniques, in order to train the network so that, once only the monitored parameters (displacements) have been entered as input data, it can return an alert parameter. So, the purpose is to develop a real-time risk predictive system that can replicate various scenarios and capable to alert, in case of imminent hazards. The experimentation conducted in relation to the possibility of transmitting an alert parameter in real time (transmitted through the help of an experimental control unit) obtained by predicting the behavior of the structure using only displacement data during monitoring is particularly interesting. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85092242029
"Application of iot in predictive maintenance using long-range communication (LoRa) The traditional Internet has been subjected to revolutionary change by the concept of Internet of Things (IoT) and has added new dimensions in the world of human-centric services. This concept basically indicates the ability of different devices to connect with each other and communicate effectively. But this revolution comes at the cost of increased demand in the number of sensor nodes that needs to be assimilated in a network. This problem is also followed by the presence of an effective network solution that has the ability to contain these requirements consequently. The wireless sensor network generally includes energy-limited devices, so energy-saving technologies are of growing concern. Latency, range coverage and bandwidth are among other issues in this IoT. LoRa emerged as the emerging solution to the above problems which has the main intention to save energy. This provides long-range, low-power data transmission rate and provides higher efficiency in wireless data communication. LoRa turns out to be the potential device to realize a large number of Internet of Things applications. A large number of papers have reported the performance and efficiency of LoRa-based wireless area network (LoRaWAN) in the fields of outdoor and radio communication, but the maximum of its potential is still unexplored.

"Online Fault Diagnosis of Mine Ventilation System Based on OCSVM and Incremental Learning To address the challenges associated with acquiring fault samples from mine ventilation systems and the scarcity of research on online diagnostics, we propose the OCISVM model, which integrates a one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) with incremental learning (IL) to facilitate real-time fault diagnosis based on sequential sensor monitoring data. During the offline phase, only normal sample data collected by sensors is utilized to construct the classification hyperplane. In the online detection phase, leveraging incremental learning principles, we update the classification hyperplane by incorporating a Delta function while assimilating new samples. Ultimately, we establish a test threshold for the model based on predefined criteria and conduct online fault diagnosis for test samples. This method has been applied successfully to a mine ventilation system. Experimental results indicate that our approach is effective for diagnosing branch faults in mine ventilation systems, achieving an accuracy rate of 97.5%, with diagnostic times at millisecond levels and enabling real-time diagnostics. Compared to conventional classification methods, this approach demonstrates enhanced stability when handling imbalanced datasets. Furthermore, relative to the recently introduced CMA-ES model, improvements in AUC, F1 score, G-mean, and ACC metrics are observed at 2.1%, 3.3%, 4.7%, and 1.9% respectively; additionally, testing time is reduced by an impressive 99.3%. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",2-s2.0-105010056373
"Taking complexity into account: A structured literature review on multi-component systems in the context of predictive maintenance One of the most prominent use cases of a digitized industry is predictive maintenance. Advances in sensor and data technology enable continuous condition monitoring, thus, extending the opportunities for predictive maintenance. However, so far, most approaches stick to a simplistic paradigm viewing industrial systems as a single-component system (SCS), assuming independence or partially neglecting interdependencies between components. However, in practice, multiple components are coupled which interact with each other; thus, leading to a multi-component system (MCS) view. Implementing the MCS is challenging, but promises many advantages for predictive maintenance. We conduct a structured literature review to investigate the current state of research about MCS and how this can be transferred to data-driven predictive maintenance. We investigate the characteristics of MCS, the promises in contrast to SCS, the challenges of its implementation, and current application areas. Finally, we discuss future work on MCS in the context of predictive maintenance. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",2-s2.0-85083979172

"Using Hardware-In-Loop-Based Fault Injection to Determine the Effects of Control Flow Errors in Industrial Control Programs Embedded systems, which are at the core of many small scale and large scale machines, are affected by external disturbances which can introduce control flow errors. These control flow errors can affect the control program executing on the embedded system, potentially causing sensor signals to be misinterpreted or actuators being mis-controlled. Software-implemented control flow error detection techniques have existed for many years, although there is little literature about these techniques being tested on input/output-driven programs. This paper presents a hardware-in-loop-based fault injection campaign performed on a typical industrial setting, i.e. a small scale factory. Thanks to hardware-in-loop simulation, we can perform the fault injection campaign without the risk of breaking a mechanical or an electrical part. For our fault injection campaign, we considered both the unprotected control program and the version protected with our RACFED error detection technique. The results show that up to 58% of the injected control flow errors can affect the unprotected control program in a dangerous manner. Implementing RACFED clearly lowers this percentage to less than 4%, showing this technique can be used in industrial settings. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85090097356

"A Feature Selection Approach for Unsupervised Steady-State Chiller Fault Detection Automated Fault Detection and Diagnosis (AFDD) algorithms play a crucial role in mitigating energy wastage and inefficient operation of the HVAC systems. By continuously monitoring data from Building Automation Systems (BAS) sensors, these algorithms can identify the abnormal behavior of the chiller system. However, to design a successful algorithm selecting proper sensors and features that can reflect normal and abnormal behavior of the system is essential. Identifying the key parameters and high-impact variables for AFDD can occur through expert-driven selection, based on empirical studies or via automated methods such as filters, wrappers, and embedded techniques for feature selection. In doing so, this study proposes combining a wrapper method with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Through an exhaustive search, the ideal number of features crucial for AFDD is identified. Notably, the selection of variables through the wrapper method relies on the classifier and the algorithm. Unlike the prior research that predominantly utilized supervised classifiers such as Support Vector Machines or Random Forests, an unsupervised algorithm, PCA, is adopted to select the optimum number of features and sensors for AFDD. The study implements a Step Forward feature selection technique within PCA to progressively identify the most effective feature subsets tailored for steady-state fault detection. Using steady-state behavior of the system, the proposed PCA-Wrapper method identifies eleven features that yield MAR and FAR values below 5%. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.",2-s2.0-85213046108
"Fault Diagnosis Network for Rotating Machinery Based on Multiscale Feature Fusion Deep learning has been widely used in rotating machinery troubleshooting due to its excellent feature-capturing capability. This research presents a novel framework for machine fault diagnosis using deep learning techniques. We introduce a multimodal feature fusion network (MFFN) that leverages the robust feature learning capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the context of picture analysis. MFFN demonstrates the capability to concurrently handle multimodal fault data, resulting in resilient performance. Specifically, the wavelet transform converts the acquired sensor signals to time-frequency distribution (TFD). Next, we apply a deep CNN to simultaneously learn the discriminative representation from the TFD feature and the original signal. In order to assess the efficacy of the developed deep model, multiple experiments were conducted on several datasets for model analysis. The experimental findings indicate that the proposed method exhibits superior performance compared to conventional fault diagnosis techniques. MFFN can automatically find and pick out useful features that improve the accuracy of fault diagnosis. This is different from traditional methods that rely on experienced professionals to extract fine features.

"Secure Transfer Learning for Machine Fault Diagnosis Under Different Operating Conditions The success of deep learning is largely due to the availability of big training data nowadays. However, data privacy could be a big concern, especially when the training or inference is done on untrusted third-party servers. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a powerful cryptography technique that enables computation on encrypted data in the absence of decryption key, thus could protect data privacy in an outsourced computation environment. However, due to its large performance and resource overheads, current applications of FHE to deep learning are still limited to very simple tasks. In this paper, we first propose a neural network training framework on FHE encrypted data, namely PrivGD. PrivGD leverages the Single-Instruction Multiple-Data (SIMD) packing feature of FHE to efficiently implement the Gradient Descent algorithm in the encrypted domain. In particular, PrivGD is the first to support training a multi-class classification network with double-precision float-point weights through approximated Softmax function in FHE, which has never been done before to the best of our knowledge. Then, we show how to apply FHE with transfer learning for more complicated real-world applications. We consider outsourced diagnosis services, as with the Machine-Learning-as-a-Service paradigm, for multi-class machine faults on machine sensor datasets under different operating conditions. As directly applying the source model trained on the source dataset (collected from source operating condition) to the target dataset (collect from the target operating condition) will lead to degraded diagnosis accuracy, we propose to transfer the source model to the target domain by retraining (fine-tuning) the classifier of the source model with data from the target domain. The target domain data is encrypted with FHE so that its privacy is preserved during the transfer learning process. We implement the secure transfer learning process with our PrivGD framework. Experiments results show that by fine-tuning a source model for fewer than 10 epochs with encrypted target domain data, the model can converge to an increased diagnosis accuracy by up to 20%, while the whole fine-tuning process takes approximate 3.85 h on our commodity server. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85097388101
"Chronologically Guided Deep Network for Remaining Useful Life Estimation In this paper, we introduce a new chronological loss function for training models to predict remaining useful life (RUL) of industrial assets based on multivariate time-series observations. The chronological loss, an alternative to the more traditional mean-squared error (MSE) loss, incorporates a monotonicity constraint, an upper bound, and a lower bound on the RUL estimates at each time step. We also present a fully-convolutional network (FCN) as a superior competitor to the current state-of-the-art approaches that are based on LSTM. Our experiments on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that deep models trained using chronological loss outperform those trained using the traditional MSE loss. We also observe that the proposed FCN architecture outperforms LSTM-based predictive models for RUL estimation on most datasets in this study. Our experiments demonstrate the potential of the proposed models to assist in observing degradation trends. Finally, we derive a sensor-importance score from the trained FCN model to enable cost savings by minimizing the number of sensors that need to be placed for asset monitoring without sacrificing RUL estimation accuracy. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85101327236

"TotaLite®: A Novel Optical Sensing System for Contactless Deformation Monitoring Asset owners across the world are facing the challenge of ageing infrastructure. Critical assets such as bridges, tunnels, roads and sluices are approaching the end of their theoretical lifetime and the costs for renovation and replacement are rising rapidly. Asset owners are increasingly looking to make the transition from corrective or preventive maintenance to condition-based, predictive maintenance. By using a data-driven approach to asset management, the actual state of an asset can be understood better, maintenance can be optimized and the remaining lifetime estimated more accurately, whilst always guaranteeing the continued safety of the asset. The current methods for monitoring the behavior of civil infrastructure are not scalable to meet the needs of the industry in the coming decades. They either require labor-intensive manual inspections, or large numbers of electronic sensors involving complex, hazardous installation and maintenance procedures.

The federated learning approach is chosen to increase data security and to reduce network traffic, given the nature of the data, which is distributed across multiple sources, such as multiple machines within a factory or across different companies. This article presents the architecture of the federated learning environment. And to test the feasibility of the architecture, a dataset recorded on a laboratory test rig is split by experiments so that each client in the simulation contains a unique feature and target distribution. Exemplary the results of 4 different federated learning strategies are compared with a model trained on the same data in a centralised fashion. The centrally trained model achieves a coefficient of determination of 0.9 on the test set, while the best federated server model achieves a coefficient of determination of 0.79. The beast mean coefficient of determination of all clients on the validation set is 0.80. The investigation of a federated learning environment with real-world time series data shows accurate results for real-time condition monitoring while respecting data privacy and provides a reliable basis for predicting the remaining life of lubricant oil. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",2-s2.0-105004405497
"Automatic Fault Detection and Classification in Lift Door Systems Using Vibration Signal Features The Internet of Things (IoT) is shaping the concept of the modern intelligent built environment. The latest developments in IoT have led to secure, energy efficient systems enabling low-cost real-time analytics. In the Vertical Transportation (VT) technologies developed by the lift industry real-time analytics are facilitating predictive maintenance which in turn decreases operational and downtime costs. Data driven predictive maintenance does not always reach an optimal performance because the quality and quantity of the data matters. Fault classification and the estimation of the remaining useful life (RUL) requires a deep understanding of failure modes and component degradation. In lift systems, most of the malfunctions are due to faults developed by the automatic power operated door systems. The most widespread Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) sensor technology used in monitoring the door mechanisms are acoustic and vibration sensors. In this paper, an automatic fault detection system using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is implemented using vibration signal features. Obtained results reveal that the fault classification performance is high (&gt;70%) under low noise environmental conditions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85102289244
"Model Based Control System for Outdoor Swimming Pools Swimming pools are closely associated to leisure activities, especially in touristic areas, and both indoor and outdoor swimming pools can be found worldwide in large quantities. With their fast growth, an increasing stress has been also placed on both energy and water resources they require to operate. In this scope renewable energy sources, especially those that use sun’s radiation are of paramount importance. Exploring alternative, green and sustainable energy sources to replace traditional sources has become one of the main points in the European Union's actions over the last decade. In this context, this paper proposes a control approach where smart decision is made based on predictions made by models representing sustainable thermal systems (local renewable energy source) and on information gathered from an array of sensors. The aim is to regulate the water temperature of an outdoor swimming pool. The information obtained from both environmental variables and from the modelling of sub-systems internal transfer function, is then combined with an optimization framework which goal is to ultimately, reduce the human intervention in the swimming pool maintenance and provide resource savings in terms of financial costs to the final user but also in terms of natural resources, contributing to environmental sustainability.

"An Architecture for a Reliability Tool Applied to Distributed Systems Contemporary software systems, such as IoT (Internet of Things) systems, present new challenges to the development process and require new strategies for quality assurance. Reliability engineering aims to detect faults in applications, often in productive environments, providing benefits to the development activity. However, due to the inherent characteristics of these systems, complementary approaches to detect faults beyond traditional testing are needed. The Tricorder methodology evaluates resource consumption profiles as a heuristic for quality assurance, and experimental studies indicate its effectiveness in detecting new faults. This work investigates the use of the Tricorder in the context of reliability engineering to support the validation of contemporary systems, particularly IoT systems. An architecture for a reliability tool is proposed, inspired by software testing concepts. A reference architecture, RefTEST, is used to support the proposed tool. Results indicate that the Tricorder methodology can be implemented as a reliability tool, and its adoption allows for identifying anomalies that are not easily detected by traditional testing methods. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",2-s2.0-105010656700
"Predictive Maintenance of an Archeological Park: An IoT and Digital Twin Based Approach The preservation of cultural heritage is one of the main goals that a nation must pursue since it represents an important resource, both economically and for the historical memory it holds. Thanks to the spread of new technologies, the possibility of applying innovative approaches to historical heritage is becoming increasingly real, in order to monitor in real time the progressive damage of structures or intercept any sudden risk situations. In this scenario, a significant contribution is made by the paradigm of the Internet of Things, which enables the collection in real time, of data from sensors installed on the structures to be monitored, and the concept of the Digital Twin, which represents a digital copy of reality, and can be utilized for practical purposes, such as simulations and tests. To make the Digital Twin even more effective, it is possible to link it to the real structure through HBIM, which is a process that aims not only at the mere restitution of the tridimensional model but at the creation of so-called “smart models”, in which all the components are parametric objects with well-defined semantics and capable of containing all the information useful for understanding the artifact. The paper, therefore, presents a methodology to consider HBIM models as Digital Twins enriched with data from real-time IoT devices placed on the structures to be monitored. The proposed methodology was applied to a real case study within the Velia Archaeological Park: Porta Rosa, which is the oldest known example of a round arch in Italy. The first results of the experiment are more than satisfactory. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",2-s2.0-85196291932

"Fatigue Life Prediction for a Concrete—Steel Composite Viaduct: A Process Based on Indirect Measurements Traffic fatigue cycles generated in steel bridge components is one of the major issues that can affect these types of structures. This paper introduces a strategy aimed at the fatigue damage assessment and remaining fatigue life prediction of concrete—steel composite bridges under traffic loads using monitoring data. The novelty of the proposed approach consists in the possibility of performing the assessment by means of indirect measurements, i.e. predicting damage at structural sections different from sensors positions. The proposed predictive model can work with real monitoring data collected, providing information on the fatigue life of selected hotspots, thus contributing to plan lifetime maintenance.

"An SHM Data-Driven Methodology for the Remaining Useful Life Prognosis of Aeronautical Subcomponents Prognosis of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of a structure from Structural Health Monitoring data is the ultimate level in the SHM hierarchy. Reliable prognostics are key to a Condition Based Maintenance paradigm for aerospace systems and structures. In the present work, we propose a methodology for RUL prognosis of generic aeronautical elements i.e. single stringered composite panels subjected to compression/compression fatigue. Strain measurements are utilized in this direction via FBG sensors bonded to the stiffener feet. The strain data collected during the fatigue life are processed and used for the RUL prognosis. In order to accomplish this task, it is essential to produce Health Indicators (HIs) out of raw strain that can properly capture the degradation process. To create such HIs a new pre/post-processing technique is employed and a variety of different HIs are developed. The quality of the HIs can enhance the performance of the prognostic algorithms, hence a fusion methodology is proposed using genetic algorithms. The resulted fused HI is used for the RUL estimation of the SSCPs. Gaussian processes and Hidden Semi Markov Models are employed for RUL prognosis and their performance is compared. Despite the complexity the raw data we demonstrate the feasibility of successful RUL prognostics in a SHM-data driven approach. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85134307838
"On the Detection of Thickness Loss in Ship Hull Structures Through Strain Sensing In recent years, interest has grown in the maritime sector towards transitioning from preventive to predictive maintenance procedures. In terms of hull structure maintenance, the incorporation of Structural Health Monitoring techniques has emerged as a leading option. The objective of this work is to move towards this direction by investigating the use of classical detection theory tools to detect corrosion-induced thickness loss in ship hull structures through strain measurements obtained from in-situ sensors. This is introduced to regions where this phenomenon is common, and candidate sensor locations are selected based on the ship’s structural arrangement. Strain response data are obtained using a detailed FE model, which is subjected to a quasi-static loading condition, specifically still water loading. Operational variability is accounted for by considering the cargo filling rates as beta-distributed random variables. A Monte Carlo Simulation is utilized to estimate the statistical structure of the response, for both the intact and damaged conditions. Based on that, their distributions are considered mean-shifted and Gaussian. Additionally, the very low coefficient of variation of the monitored static strains allows for the measurements to be considered as deterministic signals. Therefore, the tools offered by classical detection theory of deterministic signals within noise are applicable and were ultimately used to construct a detector, whose performance was evaluated on an indicative 10% thickness loss scenario. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2-s2.0-85132965932
"FEV-Swin: Multi-source heterogeneous information fusion under a variant swin transformer framework for intelligent cross-domain fault diagnosis In data-driven intelligent fault diagnosis, due to the diversity of actual data distribution, more researches focus on cross-domain fault diagnosis. Current research mainly focuses on single sensor data. However, in complex industrial systems, it is necessary to make comprehensive use of multi-source heterogeneous data to monitor the operation status of the system from multiple perspectives. To address the limitation of existing cross-domain fault diagnosis methods in effectively utilizing the complementary information from multi-source heterogeneous data, this paper proposes a novel multi-source heterogeneous information fusion model, called feature enhancement variant-swin transformer (FEV-Swin), based on the swin-transformer framework for intelligent cross-domain fault diagnosis. The proposed model incorporates a series of components designed to enhance cross-domain fault diagnosis performance. It includes a data augmentation module to increase the diversity of source domain data, a shifted windows mechanism to strengthen horizontal and vertical feature extraction capabilities, and a combination of a pyramid feature fusion module with a domain adaptation module to achieve efficient multi-source heterogeneous data fusion and distribution alignment.

"Degradation Rate Prediction of Bridges Using Historical Vibration Data Prediction of the future health state of civil structures allows maintenance agencies to undertake timely repair and replacement activities. Appropriate conduct of maintenance actions ensures accident-free operation of the transport network.

"Cross-sensor contrastive learning-based pre-training for machinery fault diagnosis under sample-limited conditions Recently, data-driven approaches have been extensively used in fault diagnosis. However, most existing methods are based on single-sensor fault data, which is hard to suit for complex industrial systems. Extracting complementary fault features from multi-sensor monitoring data is imperative, especially under limited labeled samples. Inspired by the success of self-supervised learning in handling unlabeled data, we propose a cross-sensor contrastive learning-based pre-training method for machinery fault diagnosis under sample-limited conditions. In the initial pre-training phase, we introduce an innovative cross-sensor contrastive framework to capture complementary features among different sensors for enhancing the acquisition of discriminative fault features. Then, in the fine-tuning phase, a novel cross-sensor interactive attention is designed for effective feature fusion to provide a more robust feature representation. The proposed method is validated on three benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior diagnostic performance under limited labeled samples and well-adapted to different working conditions. © 2025",2-s2.0-85216618210
"An IoT-Based Monitoring System for Induction Motor Faults Utilizing Deep Learning Models Purpose: Electrical motors are among the most widely used equipment components across many industries. Therefore, monitoring electrical motors for the early detection of faults is essential for uninterrupted production and can save time and money for manufacturers. Bearing faults are one of the most frequently encountered fault types in induction motors. Although standard offline datasets and algorithm designs have been studied extensively in recent years, they lack a full-scale IoT-based monitoring system design for data collection and deployment in the field. In this paper, outer race, inner race, and ball faults of the bearings of a three-phase (1.5 kW, 6 poles) induction motor are studied using vibration signals and an IoT-based monitoring system. Methods: The vibration signals are collected on a new testbed where the Edge processing units can process the signals and also transfer the sensor data over an IoT-based system. Raw data signals, such as vibration, current, and torque, are preprocessed at the Edge. Features are transferred to a database with Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) for long-term storage. Only the vibration signals are analyzed for the detection of bearing faults. The monitoring of vibration signals of the motor can be implemented online or offline locally at the Edge with the implemented IoT system. A Convolution Neural Network (CNN)-based deep learning algorithm is utilized to establish a data-driven condition monitoring AI model. The vibration signals are converted into spectrograms using Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT), and then the CNN model is trained. Results: The proposed IoT-based monitoring system solution, combined with the AI method, can successfully process the sensor signals from the motor. The model can distinguish a healthy bearing from three types of faulty bearings with an average accuracy rate of 95%. Conclusion: In this study, unlike the majority of the studies in the literature focusing on algorithm development with standard datasets for motor faults, a new induction motor condition monitoring system based on IoT technologies is designed and implemented. The system is scalable and can be deployed to monitor a fleet of motor equipment in manufacturing. Based on the needs, the AI model can run both at the Edge and at the server side with data analytics tools to monitor the condition of induction motor faults. © 2022, Krishtel eMaging Solutions Private Limited.",2-s2.0-85141351695
"Fault Detection for Uncertain Delta Operator Systems with Two-Channel Packet Dropouts via a Switched Systems Approach This paper utilizes a switched systems approach to deal with the problem of fault detection (FD) for uncertain delta operator networked control systems (NCSs) with packet dropouts and timevarying delays. Uncertainties exist in the matrices of the systems and are norm-bounded time-varying. Two parts of packet dropouts are considered in this paper: From sensors to controllers, and from controllers to actuators. Two independent Bernoulli distributed white sequences are introduced to account for packet dropouts. Then an FD filter is designed under an arbitrary switching law. Furthermore, the sufficient conditions for the NCSs under consideration that are exponentially stable in the mean-square sense and satisfy H∞ performance are obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), multiple Lyapunov functions (MLF) and average dwell-time (ADT) approach. The explicit expression of the desired filter parameters is given.

"Repeatability assessment of FBG-based strain measurements for bearing fault diagnostics Rolling element bearings are essential to rotating machinery, yet failures remain a leading cause of downtime and maintenance. Traditional electromechanical sensor-based methods for rotating machinery and bearing diagnostics often suffer from signal attenuation, poor fault localization, and susceptibility to electromagnetic interference (EMI). Fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors instead offer a compact, EMI-immune alternative capable of capturing localized strain at the fault site. However, the repeatability of the diagnostics capabilities under realistic conditions remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a non-invasive, repeatable adhesive-based installation method for integrating FBG sensors directly onto bearing raceways. We evaluate the robustness of this approach using healthy and artificially damaged bearings, comparing strain signals from multiple sensor and bearing re-installations. Key fault indicators, such as ball pass frequency outer and Inner, are analyzed across test cases. Results show that while damage-induced features are detectable, substantial variability arises due to installation conditions, particularly on the rotating inner race. Strain signals from sensors in the load zone exhibited the lowest uncertainty and best fault discrimination. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of repeatable, direct FBG-based bearing diagnostics and underscore the need for tailored metrics to maximize detection reliability in real-world applications. © 2025 The Author(s).

"Intelligent sensor validation for sustainable influent quality monitoring in wastewater treatment plants using stacked denoising autoencoders Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) influent conditions can dramatically affect a treatment unit's state and effluent quality. WWTP sensors may record faulty measurements due to abnormal events or the malfunction of the system, leading to serious problems in the system's operation and the violation of effluent discharge standards. Therefore, automatic fault detection and faulty data reconciliation are crucial for an efficient and stable WWTP monitoring. In this study, a holistic framework for sensor validation of WWTP influent conditions is presented considering the non-linearity, measurement noise, and complexity of the WWTP's data. A stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE) model is proposed to detect, identify, and reconcile faulty data based on data from a real WWTP in South Korea. The proposed SDAE architecture presented a detection rate (DR) between 74% and 98%. The faulty sensor was identified using an SDAE-based sensor validity index (SVI). Data reconciliation showed that the SDAE was the most suitable reconciliation method based on the root mean square error (RMSE) for total nitrogen (TN) influent conditions of 4.04 mg N/L.

"Multiscale cyclic frequency demodulation-based feature fusion framework for multi-sensor driven gearbox intelligent fault detection Accurate fault detection is extremely important to ensure stable gearbox operation. Data-driven schemes using cyclic spectral have received significant attention due to their robust demodulation performance. However, these schemes are mainly applied to process single sensor signals, and they are unable to accurately obtain precise fault features. This paper proposed a novel multiscale cyclic frequency demodulation (MCFD)-based feature fusion framework for multi-sensor driven gearbox intelligent fault diagnosis. Firstly, the MCFD is proposed to analyze the vibration signals from multi-sensor driven gearbox, which acquires the multi-sensor mode information without setting parameters in advance. Thereafter, the grey relational degree between the multi-sensor mode information and original signal is calculated, and its results are normalized to obtain the relationship coefficients. Finally, the acquired coefficients are performed for multi-sensor information fusion to form the covariance matrix for gearbox fault diagnosis. The effectiveness of the proposed feature fusion framework is validated using the gearbox case.

"Sensor Fault Diagnosis and Tolerant Control Based on Belief Rule Base for Complex System This paper develops a new fault diagnosis and tolerant control framework of sensor failure (SFDTC) for complex system such as rockets and missiles. The new framework aims to solve two problems: The lack of data and the multiple uncertainty of knowledge. In the SFDTC framework, two parts exist: The fault diagnosis model and the output reconstruction model. These two parts of the new framework are constructed based on the new developed belief rule base with power set (BRB-PS). The multiple uncertainty of knowledge can be addressed by the local ignorance and global ignorance in the new developed BRB-PS model. Then, the stability of the developed framework is proved by the output error of the BRB-PS model. For complex system, the sensor state is determined by many factors and experts cannot provide accurate knowledge. The multiple uncertain knowledge will reduce the performance of the initial SDFTC framework.

"Smart machine fault diagnostics based on fault specified discrete wavelet transform This study examines the impact of the mother wavelet, sensor selection, and machine learning (ML) models for smart fault diagnosis of rotating machines via discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The ability of Daubechies, Haar, Biorthogonal (Bior), Symlets (Sym), and Coiflets (Coif) wavelets is measured in terms of distinguishing imbalance, horizontal/vertical misalignment, and overhang/underhang bearing ball, cage, and outer race faults. For this purpose, single-step and two-step fault monitoring (SSFM and TSFM) approaches are proposed. In SSFM, the ML models detect the fault type by the healthy and faulty signals. In TSFM, the built models first determined whether the machine is faulty or not. If it is, then the models detect the fault type. As ML models, Random Forest (RF), AdaBoost with C4.5 (AB-C4.5), and two artificial neural network algorithms are trained by the features of DWT. Besides, the effect of the sensor type on the fault diagnosis is measured by considering the tachometer, microphone, and two accelerometers individually and combined. The results are interpreted regarding the evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix, and model built time. It is concluded that Bior3.1 and Haar wavelets distinguish the fault type more accurately than other wavelets.

"Intelligent fault diagnosis of worm gearbox based on adaptive CNN using amended gorilla troop optimization with quantum gate mutation strategy The worm gearbox is a power transmission system that has various applications in industries. Being vital element of machinery, it becomes necessary to develop a robust fault diagnosis scheme for worm gearbox. Due to advancements in sensor technology, researchers from academia and industries prefer deep learning models for fault diagnosis. The optimal selection of hyperparameters (HPs) of deep learning models plays a significant role in stable performance. Existing methods mainly focused on manual tunning of these parameters, which is a troublesome process and sometimes leads to inaccurate results. Thus, exploring more sophisticated methods to optimize the HPs automatically is important. In this work, a novel optimization, i.e. amended gorilla troop optimization (AGTO), has been proposed to make the convolutional neural network (CNN) adaptive for extracting the features to identify the worm gearbox defects. Initially, the vibration and acoustic signals are converted into 2D images by the Morlet wavelet function. Then, the initial model of CNN is developed by setting hyperparameters. The search space of each HP is identified and optimized by the developed AGTO algorithm. The classification accuracy has been evaluated by AGTO-CNN, which is further validated by the confusion matrix. The performance of the developed model has also been compared with other models. It has been observed that the proposed AGTO not only achieved the highest degree of recognition accuracy i.e. 98.95 % but also achieved the least standard of deviation of 0.2145 than that of other classifiers. The AGTO algorithm is examined on twenty-three classical benchmark functions and the Wilcoxon test which demonstrates the effectiveness and dominance of the developed optimization algorithm.

In this sense, the main objective of this work is to contribute to the topics of SHM and artificial intelligence, demonstrating another potential application of convolutional neural networks to support the diagnosis of structural damage of rotating systems by using the ISHM approach. For this aim, structural condition of a rotor supported by two ball bearings, with two disks, and one pulley was monitored by considering four different health conditions and three different operating speeds. Then, a 6-layer 1D-CNN model was formulated individually for the three PZT sensors attached to the rotor shaft. As input data, all sample points of the measured impedance signatures were considered. The results from this implementation demonstrate the potential of the procedure conveyed as shown by a minimum accuracy of 92.22% for all evaluated PZT patches. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.",2-s2.0-85150906774
"Extremely Low-Speed Bearing Fault Diagnosis Based on Raw Signal Fusion and DE-1D-CNN Network Introduction: An effective data-driven bearing fault diagnosis has been moving away from traditional reliance on statistical features toward a focus on raw time-domain analysis. This transition is driven by the need to preserve the critical information contained within the signals. Purpose: In machinery maintenance, a challenge arises when attempting to detect bearing faults under extremely low operating conditions. This is due to the minimal interaction between the rolling element and the fault at such speeds. In response to this, the research aims to tackle the issue of bearing fault detection under these low-speed operating conditions by introducing an advanced fault diagnosis approach. Method: The proposed method involves the utilization of acoustic emission and vibration sensors to capture the vibration behavior of the bearing component at low operating conditions. Importantly, a data fusion strategy is adopted to fuse the raw signals obtained from both sensor types. These fused signals are then directly input into the novel one-dimensional optimized convolutional neural network (1D-CNN). To further enhance the model’s performance, a differential evolution algorithm is leveraged for the optimization of its hyperparameters. To validate the effectiveness of the approach, a preliminary analysis is initially conducted using the CWRU dataset, comparing the diagnosis accuracy of the proposed model to existing literature results. Subsequently, the model’s performance is evaluated using experimental data collected under low operating speed conditions, spanning a range from 48 rpm (extremely low speed) to 300 rpm (low speed). Result: The results showcase the remarkable capability of the DE-1D-CNN model to diagnose the presence of bearing faults under low-speed conditions, with the highest achieved accuracy standing at an impressive 100%. Through the judicious optimization of hyperparameters, the proposed 1D-CNN model proves its competence in bearing fault diagnosis even when the signal was collected under challenging low-speed operating conditions. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023. corrected publication 2023.",2-s2.0-85179745771
"GAS turbine sensor fault diagnostic system in a real-time executable digital-twin In this study, a sensor fault diagnostic system to detect/isolate and accommodate faults in sensors from an industrial gas turbine has been developed. The sensor fault diagnostic module is integrated with a gas turbine real-time executable digital-twin (RT xDT) reported in a previous study. The sensor fault diagnostic module of the digital-twin considers analytical sensor redundancy using a reference engine model to provide redundant estimates of measured engine variables. A Software-in-the-Loop (S-i-L) architecture and Hardware-in-the-Loop (H-i-L) facility are constructed to assess the sensor diagnostic module (fault detection/ fault isolation) during failure in sensors from the engine. The results demonstrated that if the discrepancy between virtual measurement (provided by digital-twin) and sensor measurement exceeds the prescribed tolerance levels, the sensor fault diagnostic logic determines the state of switching between the virtual and engine sensor measurements in a dual lane control configuration of the gas turbine control system. The sensor fault detection system implemented in the gas turbine RT xDT can be deployed onto a distributed control system of industrial gas turbines to diagnose sensor deficiencies and ensure continuous and safe operation of the gas turbine. Consequently, the developed system will increase engine availability and reliability by diagnosing engine operational deficiencies before severe failure. © 2023 Siemens Energy.",2-s2.0-85150376025
"Applying Infrared Thermography as a Method for Online Monitoring of Turbine Blade Coolant Flow As gas turbine engine manufacturers strive to implement condition-based operation and maintenance, there is a need for blade monitoring strategies capable of early fault detection and root-cause determination. Given the importance of blade cooling flows to turbine blade health and longevity, there is a distinct lack of methodologies for coolant flowrate monitoring. The present study addresses this identified opportunity by applying an infrared thermography system on an engine-representative research turbine to generate data-driven models for prediction of blade coolant flowrate. Thermal images were used as inputs to a linear regression and regularization algorithm to relate blade surface temperature distribution with blade coolant flowrate. Additionally, this study investigates how coolant flowrate prediction accuracy is influenced by the number and breadth of diagnostic measurements. The results of this study indicate that a source of high-fidelity training data can be used to predict blade coolant flowrate within about six percent error. Furthermore, identification of prioritized sensor placement supports application of this technique across multiple sensor technologies capable of measuring blade surface temperature in operating gas turbine engines, including spatially resolved and point-based measurement techniques.

"Fault detection for multirate systems with sensor saturation subject to stochastic delayed redundant channels In this paper, the fault detection (FD) problem is investigated for a class of multirate systems (MRSs) with sensor saturation subject to redundant channels. Lifting technology is utilized to convert MRSs into single rate systems. The redundant channel transmission strategy (RCTS) with communication delays is employed to improve quality and reliability of data transmission between the sensor and the remote fault detection filter (FDF), where the occurrence probability of delays is partially known. Specifically, an FDF is constructed to ensure that the augmented system maintains stochastic stability and meets the prescribed H∞ performance. Then, the FDF gains are obtained by linear matrix inequality (LMI) method. In addition, in order to verify the performance of the FDF subject to redundant channels, an FDF over single channel is also designed for comparison.

"Locating Sensors in Large-Scale Engineering Systems for Fault Isolation Based on Fault Feature Reduction Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) modules in a modern control system are effective in detecting and identifying abnormal process behaviours in a timely manner, ensuring the high-performance of large-scale engineering systems. The detection and isolation of faults is essentially built on the characterisation of the observed behaviour of a system. However, due to the large number of technical indicators available for measurement, as well as the various constraints of sensor installation, monitoring all the operating parameters of a large-scale engineering system is not feasible. Therefore, locating sensors optimally in a large-scale system, to achieve a comprehensive description of an abnormality, becomes a key issue to successfully apply diagnostic technologies to real world situations. In this paper, a fault feature reduction (FFR) based sensor location approach is proposed for optimal sensor placement so as to achieve the desired performance of fault detection and isolation. The behaviour of faults is firstly analysed using a fault tree to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the multi-dimensional relationships between faults and symptoms. A Boolean matrix is then constructed to represent the corresponding relations around faults and potential sensors. All the alternative configurations of sensors, for a desired diagnosis of a system, are obtained by eliminating the redundant fault features. The trade-off without a certain sensor is also attained using the following proposed approach. Three large-scale systems, including, a diesel engine system and two chemical systems, are used to illustrate the proposed approach. Comparisons to existing competitive techniques indicate the enhanced abilities of the proposed approach to meet the varying requirements of a real-world monitoring network. The analysis of sensor placement can be performed at the design phase of a large-scale engineering system, to locate the preset measured hole, or, during the life-cycle, to perfect an incomplete or redundant monitoring system. © 2020 The Franklin Institute",2-s2.0-85087706629
"Driving behavior analysis and classification by vehicle OBD data using machine learning The transportation industry’s focus on improving performance and reducing costs has driven the integration of IoT and machine learning technologies. The correlation between driving style and behavior with fuel consumption and emissions has highlighted the need to classify different driver’s driving patterns. In response, vehicles now come equipped with sensors that gather a wide range of operational data. The proposed technique collects critical vehicle performance data, including speed, motor RPM, paddle position, determined motor load, and over 50 other parameters through the OBD interface. The OBD-II diagnostics protocol, the primary diagnostic process used by technicians, can acquire this information via the car’s communication port. OBD-II protocol is used to acquire real-time data linked to the vehicle’s operation. This data are used to collect engine operation-related characteristics and assist with fault detection. The proposed method uses machine learning techniques, such as SVM, AdaBoost, and Random Forest, to classify driver’s behavior based on ten categories that include fuel consumption, steering stability, velocity stability, and braking patterns. The solution offers an effective means to study driving behavior and recommend corrective actions for efficient and safe driving. The proposed model offers a classification of ten driver classes based on fuel consumption, steering stability, velocity stability, and braking patterns. This research work uses data extracted from the engine’s internal sensors via the OBD-II protocol, eliminating the need for additional sensors. The collected data are used to build a model that classifies driver’s behavior and can be used to provide feedback to improve driving habits. Key driving events, such as high-speed braking, rapid acceleration, deceleration, and turning, are used to characterize individual drivers. Visualization techniques, such as line plots and correlation matrices, are used to compare drivers’ performance. Time-series values of the sensor data are considered in the model. The supervised learning methods are employed to compare all driver classes. SVM, AdaBoost, and Random Forest algorithms are implemented with 99%, 99%, and 100% accuracy, respectively. The suggested model offers a practical approach to examining driving behavior and suggesting necessary measures to enhance driving safety and efficiency. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2-s2.0-85159687421
"Optimizing silt density index prediction in water treatment systems using pressure-based gradient boosting hybridized with Salp Swarm Algorithm This study introduces a novel approach for predicting Silt Density Index (SDI) values in desalination systems by combining Gradient Boosting with the Salp Swarm Algorithm (GBSSA). The integration of GBSSA enhances predictive accuracy over a one-month period, addressing critical challenges related to water scarcity exacerbated by climate change. Data were collected from two desalination plants in western Algeria, specifically the Benisaf and El Mactaa plants, to train and validate the models. Pressure measurements were chosen as input features due to their ease of measurement and the use of simple, cost-effective equipment, minimizing the need for complex sensors and reducing manual intervention. The study compared the performance of three Gradient Boosting variants: the standard Gradient Boosting model (GB), Gradient Boosting optimized with Particle Swarm Optimization (GBPSO), and the proposed GBSSA model. Results demonstrated that the GBSSA model significantly outperformed both GB and GBPSO, achieving superior accuracy in predicting SDI values.

"Enhanced Bearing Fault Diagnosis Through Trees Ensemble Method and Feature Importance Analysis Purpose: This research introduces a groundbreaking method for bearing defect detection. It leverages ensemble machine learning (ML) models and conducts comprehensive feature importance analysis. The key innovation is the training and benchmarking of three tree ensemble models—Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)—on an extensive experimental dataset (QU-DMBF) collected from bearing tests with seeded defects of varying sizes on the inner and outer raceways under different operating conditions. Method: The dataset was meticulously prepared with categorical variable encoding and Min–Max data normalization to ensure consistent class distribution and model accuracy. Implementing the ML models involved a grid search method for hyperparameter tuning, focusing on reporting the models’ accuracy. The study also explores applying ensemble methods and using supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms for bearing fault detection. It underscores the value of feature importance analysis in understanding the contributions of specific inputs to the model’s performance. The research compares the ML models to traditional methods and discusses their potential for advanced fault diagnosis in bearing systems. Results and Conclusions: The XGBoost model, trained on data from actual bearing tests, outperformed the others, achieving 92% accuracy in detecting bearing health and fault location. However, a deeper analysis of feature importance reveals that the models weigh certain experimental conditions differently—such as sensor location and motor speed.

"Prediction of Clean-room Air-conditioning Defects Using Deep Learning and a Differential Pressure Sensor A clean room is used for adjusting the concentration of suspended particles using an air-conditioner. It has a fan-filter unit combining a centrifugal fan and a high-efficiency particulate air filter that purifies the outside air and directly affects its cleanliness. Defects in these systems are typically detected using special sensors for each fault, which can be costly. Therefore, this paper proposes a system for diagnosing defects in the fan-filter unit using a single differential sensor and deep learning. The fan-filter unit is part of the air-conditioning system, and it is usually defective in bearings, filters, and motors. These faults include ball wear, internal bearing contamination, filter contamination, and motor speed changes. Each defect was artificially induced in experiments, and the differential pressure data of each defect was learned using a long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning algorithm. The results of deep learning experiments generated by randomly mixing data five times were presented using a confusion matrix, and the results showed an accuracy of 87.2±2.60%.

"iAgent fault-tolerance approach (iAFTA) based on optimization algorithms in wireless sensor networks Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) face persistent challenges in energy efficiency and fault tolerance due to limited node battery life. This paper introduces a novel multi-goal intelligent agent approach (iAFTA) for static WSNs, where intelligent agents (iAgents) proactively monitor cluster head (CH) energy, detect failures, and dynamically elect replacements based on energy and proximity. The process integrates fault tolerance to prevent cascading failures while minimizing energy consumption through adaptive minimum spanning tree (MST) reconfiguration. The proposed iAFTA approach is evaluated across five distinct scenarios using key metrics such as first node dead (FND), half node dead (HND), last node dead (LND), average energy consumption (AEC), and CH replacement rate. In addition, fault-tolerance metrics, including fault detection accuracy, detection time, and energy overhead, are evaluated. Results show that iAFTA achieves 100 % fault detection accuracy, immediate detection and recovery (average detection time of 1.0 round), and low-energy overhead during fault handling, even in large-scale scenarios. Results demonstrate significant improvements over existing protocols like BWOA-V. In Scenarios #1 and #2 (1600 rounds, 200 nodes), iAFTA delayed the FND by 12.1 % (1012.4 vs. 903.9 rounds) and 25.3 % (1096.2 vs. 875.2 rounds), respectively, while maintaining partial functionality beyond round 1600. BWOA-V fully degraded by round 1250.7. In Scenario #3 (100x100m area), all nodes survived under iAFTA, whereas BWOA-V recorded an FND at 1137.1 rounds. Furthermore, iAFTA reduced AEC by 93.3 % at round 500 (0.0138 J vs. 0.2056 J for BWOA-V) and ensured robust fault tolerance with only 11 CH replacements, balancing residual energy among CHs in later rounds. While these results validate iAFTA’s scalability and resilience for large-scale WSN applications, certain limitations were identified during testing under high-stress conditions in Scenarios #4 and #5 (15,000 rounds). In Scenario #4, the LND metric was undefined across all runs due to simulation termination before complete network depletion, limiting the ability to fully assess overall network lifespan but confirming that iAFTA prevents simultaneous energy exhaustion across nodes. In Scenario #5, a high node density of 900 nodes resulted in an average of 4074 CH replacements, reflecting robust energy redistribution but also exposing challenges in achieving balanced energy depletion across all nodes. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.",2-s2.0-105008277029
"Attention-aware temporal–spatial graph neural network with multi-sensor information fusion for fault diagnosis Intelligent fault diagnosis has attracted intensive efforts in machine predictive maintenance. However, the structural information from multi-sensor signals has not been fully investigated. In this study, a novel temporal–spatial graph neural network with an attention-aware module (A-TSGNN) is proposed to accomplish multi-source information fusion. First, the graph structure naturally organizes the diverse sensors. The graph convolution model realizes the feature representation in the spatial dimension. Then, time-dependent learning is applied in the temporal dimension, and a temporal–spatial learning framework is built. An additional attention module is designed to learn the flexible weights and model the importance of individual sensors and their correlations. Experiments on a wind turbine dataset achieves an accuracy of 0.9669 and an F1-score of 0.9649. For the gearbox dataset, the values are 0.9927 and 0.9920, respectively. The overall macro-average area under the curve metrics reach a perfect score of 1.00 for both datasets, indicating exceptional performance. The adaptive attention mechanism is also discussed to verify the superiority of the A-TSGNN.

"Real-time monitoring of hydrogen composite pressure vessels using surface-applied distributed fiber optic sensors In this paper, we report to the best of our knowledge for the first time on continuous real-time monitoring of composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs) designed for hydrogen storage using surface-applied distributed fiber optic sensors (DFOS). We conducted continuous and real-time DFOS measurements during pressure cycling tests consisting of periodic pressure fluctuations between 20 bar and 875 bar, with a rate of 5 cycles min−1. During pressure cycling, the DFOS system measured strain changes, that under normal operating conditions were linearly correlated to changes in pressure. To detect and quantify damage-related anomalies, we trained a simple regression model to predict strain from pressure data and used the difference between predicted and measured values as a damage indicator. With our approach, the DFOS system not only detected and localized the damage but also continuously tracked its evolution in real time under dynamic pressure conditions. Furthermore, unlike previous studies where optical fibers were embedded within the composite structure, we applied them on the COPV surface, reducing both implementation cost and time while eliminating the need to modify the COPV manufacturing process. Based on our results, we are confident that DFOS can enhance safety and facilitate the transition from time-consuming periodic inspections to more efficient, machine learning-based predictive maintenance. © 2025 The Author(s).

"A transformer with layer-cross decoding for remaining useful life prediction Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is critical for industrial equipment status detection, and the accurate prediction results provide decision-makers with actionable information. Preventive maintenance can be carried out to prevent the sudden failure of the equipment effectively based on the predicted results. However, as Industry 4.0 technologies develop, the amount of data collected by sensors is also rapidly increasing.

"Detection of pump faults based on sound signals using non-negative matrix factorization Maintenance is very closely related to the performance of the production process. An alternative method that can be used to determine the damage to the engine is from the analysis of the sound pattern produced. If the sound source is more than one, then there will be signal mixing, and it will be a challenge in detecting damage to the engine. In this study, mixed signals will be separated. Separation of mixed sound signals was done using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) method. Overall this study is aimed at detecting unbalance, misalignment, and bearing faults at pumps with microphones as sensors. The pumps used in this study were three pumps, where each pump had different conditions (unbalance, misalignment, and bearing fault). All three pumps have 3000 rpm. In this study, the recording process was carried out for 5 s. In this study, we also compare the location of the instantaneous frequency in full spectrum and corresponding frequency in local spectrum, and the distance between the spectra via the log spectral distance from the baseline signal and the estimated signal. Based on the instantaneous frequency approach, no error was found because of the instantaneous frequency suitability of the unbalanced machine condition with the estimated signal in the mixing configuration of three sources with two sensors. From the log spectral instance (LSD) results, the smallest value was obtained the smallest value in estimation 2, which tends to approach the unbalance condition with the LSD value of 1.0889.

This is because any anomaly in this sense affects the entire production chain and can disrupt the internal functioning of a factory at various levels... To achieve this goal, control is required throughout the process so that intervention can be made as quickly as possible without slowing down the cycle time or increasing the price of the product. To free themselves from these complicated control processes, industrial companies are turning to the technology of artificial intelligence technology, more specifically machine learning, which is the key to Industry 4.0, to automate the control process. Hence the objective of this article.

This paper considers the monitoring problem of multimode processes with stochastic perturbations, in which frequent mode switches caused by stochastic perturbations are taken into account. Contrary to the widely used assumption of instant mode switches, the dynamics during the transition process caused by perturbations are considered. To cope with transient characteristics, a mode identification algorithm based on the conditional random field is proposed. Compared with traditional multimode process monitoring methods, the assumption of independence between adjacent observations is not required, which improves the mode identification accuracy. In addition, an index called log conditional probability ratio is proposed, and its Mahalanobis distance is used for fault detection. The fault detectability of the proposed method is analyzed, with a sufficient condition and a necessary condition of detecting a sensor fault derived, respectively. The effectiveness of mode identification and fault detection is demonstrated by a numerical example and a continuous stirred tank reactor simulation. © 2020 The Franklin Institute",2-s2.0-85087025722

"Adaptive EKF enhanced fault diagnosis and fault tolerant control for space manipulators with position measurements only Space manipulators play a critical role in the operation of space robots. However, the failure of these manipulators can affect the control performance and even lead to instability. To improve the safety and robustness of space manipulators, this paper presents an efficient fault diagnosis and fault tolerant control method by integrating adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF) and sliding mode control (SMC). The proposed method uses AEKF for system estimation, taking into account uncertainties in the process and measurement noise, as well as sensor limitations. By detecting the failure of angle sensors timely, the trajectory tracking performance can be guaranteed by the robustness of AEKF. In cases where a joint experiences free-swinging, the failure can be identified based on the estimated control effectiveness coefficients from AEKF. Then, once the failure is identified, the joint angle can be regulated by exploiting the motion coupling between the joints. Furthermore, SMC is employed to mitigate the effects of unknown disturbances in the joints. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through numerical simulation, which illustrates its ability to diagnose failures and maintain control performance under various failure scenarios. In addition, the robustness of the method is verified through Monte Carlo simulation, demonstrating its reliability in dealing with various uncertainties. © 2024",2-s2.0-85190726400

"Improving the robustness of industrial Cyber–Physical Systems through machine learning-based performance anomaly identification We propose a versatile and fully data-centric methodology towards anomaly detection and identification in modern industrial Cyber–Physical Systems (CPS). Our motivation behind this move is the ever-growing computerisation in these systems, in the form of complex distributed computing nodes, running complex distributed software. Industrial CPS also demonstrate heavy deployment of hardware sensors, as well as an increasing role for software. We observe the insufficiency and costliness of design-time measures in prevention of anomalies. As our main contribution, our methodology is taking advantage of this data-rich environment by means of Extra-Functional Behaviour (EFB) monitoring, analytics pipelines and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Specifically, we demonstrate the use of compartmentalisation of execution timelines into distinct units, i.e., execution phases. We introduce the generation of representations for these phases, i.e., behavioural signatures and behavioural passports, as our way of behavioural fingerprinting. Composed using regression modelling techniques, signatures as the representation of ongoing behaviour, are compared to passports, representing reference behaviour. The comparison is done by means of goodness-of-fit scores, creating quantifiable measures of deviation between different recorded behaviours. We have used both partially synthetic and real-world traces in our experiments, depending on the use-case. We have also followed both white box and black box approaches for our use-cases, with discussions on the pros and cons of each. The effectiveness of our data-centric methodology is demonstrated by two proofs-of-concept from the industry, to represent the two ends of the industrial CPS complexity spectrum, with one being a large semiconductor photolithography machine, while the other is an image analysis platform. Each use-case comes with its own characteristics and limitations, confirming the flexibility of our methodology and the relevance of its integral steps in the approach towards the initial analysis and data transformations. The results of anomaly classification show overall high accuracies, as high as 99% in certain set-ups.

"Internet of Things (IoT) Based Air Conditioner Monitoring System for Intelligent Facility Maintenance Office buildings often consume high energy to sustain building operations such as HVAC systems. A lack of proper decision-making approaches and a lack of maintenance planning will cause higher operational costs. This paper proposes data analytics for air conditioner’s performance in laboratory by using Internet of Things (IoT)-based monitoring system to improve efficiency in facility maintenance. It provides a monitoring system, notification system and performance dashboard to enable data analytics. The data analytics methods used here are i) condition-based maintenance which includes thermal analysis and electrical analysis; and ii) Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) approach. The pre-maintenance performance measured for AC-1 is adequate while AC-2 does not meet the requirement. After the reactive maintenance was performed on AC-2; there was a performance increment of 63.15%. Based on sensors data, it seems to correlate between current draw and low refrigerant. It aids facility maintenance for early failure detection, which helps in decision-making. The result from the OEE approach also suggested the same decision-making to schedule maintenance. Performance needs to balance out to leverage power consumption without hefty operational costs for maintenance strategies. In conclusion, the data analytics provide insight for the maintenance management to monitor and schedule preventive maintenance before air conditioner (AC) faults happen. Meanwhile, the modified OEE approach for ACs to measure performance takes into consideration speed to cool down air and cost to run the AC which has not been explored yet elsewhere. © 2023, National University of Malaysia.

"Hydraulic directional valve fault diagnosis using a weighted adaptive fusion of multi-dimensional features of a multi-sensor; [基于多传感器多维特征加权自适应融合的液压换向阀故障诊断] Because the hydraulic directional valve usually works in a bad working environment and is disturbed by multi-factor noise, the traditional single sensor monitoring technology is difficult to use for an accurate diagnosis of it. Therefore, a fault diagnosis method based on multi-sensor information fusion is proposed in this paper to reduce the inaccuracy and uncertainty of traditional single sensor information diagnosis technology and to realize accurate monitoring for the location or diagnosis of early faults in such valves in noisy environments. Firstly, the statistical features of signals collected by the multi-sensor are extracted and the depth features are obtained by a convolutional neural network (CNN) to form a complete and stable multi-dimensional feature set. Secondly, to obtain a weighted multi-dimensional feature set, the multi-dimensional feature sets of similar sensors are combined, and the entropy weight method is used to weight these features to reduce the interference of insensitive features. Finally, the attention mechanism is introduced to improve the dual-channel CNN, which is used to adaptively fuse the weighted multi-dimensional feature sets of heterogeneous sensors, to flexibly select heterogeneous sensor information so as to achieve an accurate diagnosis. Experimental results show that the weighted multi-dimensional feature set obtained by the proposed method has a high fault-representation ability and low information redundancy. It can diagnose simultaneously internal wear faults of the hydraulic directional valve and electromagnetic faults of actuators that are difficult to diagnose by traditional methods. This proposed method can achieve high fault-diagnosis accuracy under severe working conditions. © 2022, Zhejiang University Press.",2-s2.0-85128466986
"Use of Proximity-Based Shaft Displacement Sensors for Rolling Element Bearing Fault Diagnosis Purpose: Traditional bearing health monitoring relies on acceleration signals from accelerometers on bearing housings. Displacement sensors, like proximity probes, are commonly used for rotor vibration monitoring and balance checks. This research aims to investigate the efficacy of employing displacement vibration signals for the detection of faults in rolling element bearings. Methods: This study establishes that through appropriate signal processing of raw shaft displacement data, reliable indications of bearing faults can be obtained. Time-domain vibration signals are decomposed into intrinsic-mode functions (IMFs) using ensemble empirical mode decomposition. The most relevant IMF, containing fault-related information, is selected based on a proposed impulsiveness indicator. Autocorrelation of the energy time series of the sensitive IMF is suggested for fault classification. Results: The proposed methodology is validated using experimental data from damaged bearings and an accelerated bearing life test. A comprehensive comparison between displacement sensors and accelerometers confirms that, with suitable signal processing, displacement sensors effectively capture bearing fault information and assess fault severity. Conclusions: This research establishes that, with proper signal processing, displacement sensors are effective for bearing health monitoring and assessing fault severity.

"Reconfiguration of an Adaptive Structure's Control Loop Based on Diagnosed Sensor and Actuator Faults Adaptive high-rise buildings can achieve significantly reduced resource consumption by incorporating actuators, sensor systems, and a control unit into the structure to compensate for the reduced stiffness. A vital step toward the wide real-world viability of this concept is ensuring the long-term operational reliability of adaptive buildings even in case of components malfunctioning. This article presents a comprehensive mechanical model of a large-scale adaptive high-rise structure incorporating various sensor systems as well as different actuation principles. As a basis for the simulative validation under critical load scenarios, a detailed model for wind disturbances is derived, accounting for time-variant velocity and direction. A parity space-based fault diagnosis scheme is employed for the reliable diagnosis of faulty sensors and actuators. Based upon the fault diagnosis, a reconfiguration strategy for estimation and control in adaptive structures is proposed. Assembling these components yields a fault-tolerant control loop that automatically adapts to the emergence of faults in sensors and actuators.

"Multi-response Optimization of Diagnosis Vibration Parameters of Broken Rotor Bars in Induction Motors Using Grey Relational Analysis in the Taguchi Method Purpose: Broken rotor bars (BRBs) are one of the industry's most common induction motor faults. However, choosing the best indicators to determine the measurement conditions for vibration analysis presents a challenge for the early location of this kind of fault. Methods: This article addresses a monitoring and fault diagnosis approach based on the Taguchi method with grey relational analysis (GRA). This method is a commonly employed optimization technique for enhancing production quality. Nevertheless, we have adapted it to enhance the measurement conditions and determine the best measurement quality of vibration indicators. Three parameters, namely electric motor speeds, loads and type of sensor, are optimized to determine the most sensitive temporal features of vibration. A grey relational grade (GRG) obtained from the GRA is used to solve the early detection of rotor failure with multiple performance characteristics. Results: Based on the GRG, optimum levels of measurement parameters have been identified, and their significant contribution is determined by the analysis of variance (ANOVA). Also, Linear and quadratic regression analyses were applied to predict the temporal features. The predicted values of the second-order mathematical model are very close to the measured ones and present a higher R square value. The performance of the quadratic regression model was validated by the high Pearson correlation coefficient and the low Mean Absolute Error. Conclusion: The proposed approach has proven efficient in BRBs detection and it can be easily replicated for diverse motor defects. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.",2-s2.0-105008908990
"Partial Rub Detection Based on Instantaneous Angular Speed Measurement and Variational Mode Decomposition Purpose: During their lifetime, rotating machines experience various problems. Among others, rotor–stator rubbing is one of the most common problems encountered. Therefore, this paper proposes a two-step procedure for rotor–stator partial rub detection. Methods: The first step applies the instantaneous angular speed (IAS) measurement. In this paper, the IAS signal is measured at low to moderate sampling rates as an analog signal from the zebra tape encoder. The correction of encoder segment non-uniformity is also briefly presented in the paper. As a means of coping with the nonlinear signal of the partial rub, the variational mode decomposition (VMD) is proposed in the paper, as the second step of the detection procedure. The VMD is a relatively new method with promising results for machinery fault detection. Results: The partial rub detection tool was tested on the laboratory test rig under three different rotor operating conditions; firstly, for constant rotor speed without rubbing, secondly for rotor running at near critical constant speed with light rotor–stator rubbing, and finally under the condition which describes capabilities of the proposed rubbing detection procedure during variable rotor speed operation. The measurements were taken with an optical phase sensor pointed at the zebra tape encoder. The results are presented in the shape of rotor orbits, IAS signals, FFT spectra of IAS signals and VMD spectrograms of IAS signals. Conclusions: It can be concluded that VMD spectrogram of IAS signal yields a clear detection criterion for light partial rotor–stator rubbing by the presence of 1/2×, 3/2× and 5/2× fractional harmonics. Depending on the analyzed conditions of partial rubbing, at least one of the mentioned fractional harmonics should appear. © 2019, Krishtel eMaging Solutions Private Limited.",2-s2.0-85074026772
"Machine Learning Models Applied to a GNSS Sensor Network for Automated Bridge Anomaly Detection Structural health monitoring (SHM) based on global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) is an interesting solution to provide absolute positions at different locations of a structure in a global reference frame. In particular, low-cost GNSS stations for large-scale bridge monitoring have gained increasing attention these last years because recent experiments showed the ability to achieve a subcentimeter accuracy for continuous monitoring with adequate combinations of antennas and receivers. Technical solutions now allow displacement monitoring of long bridges with a cost-effective deployment of GNSS sensing networks. In particular, the redundancy of observations within the GNSS network with various levels of correlations between the GNSS time series makes such monitoring solution a good candidate for anomaly detection based on machine learning models, using several predictive models for each sensor (based on environmental conditions, or other sensors as input data). This strategy is investigated in this paper based on GNSS time series, and an anomaly indicator is proposed to detect and locate anomalous structural behavior. The proposed concepts are applied to a cable-stayed bridge for illustration, and the comparison between multiple tools highlights recurrent neural networks (RNN) as an effective regression tool. Coupling this tool with the proposed anomaly detection strategy enables one to identify and localize both real and simulated anomalies in the considered data set. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.",2-s2.0-85137109652
"Online reconstruction and diagnosibility analysis of multiplicative fault models for process-related faults Multiplicative faults generally refer to the change of process parameters or structures which are well-suited to represent the process-related anomalies. Unlike sensor faults and external disturbances that are added into process observations and independent with process states, process-related faults directly influence process states such that it is more challenge to reconstruct and diagnose. To address the process-related fault diagnosis, an online fault reconstruction method based on the multiplicative fault model is proposed with the commonly used multivariate statistical process monitoring framework. The fault reconstruction strategy based on the multiplicative fault representation is given by minimizing reconstruction errors. The diagnosability of the proposed reconstruction method is guaranteed for the change of a single parameter, also known as a unidimensional fault. Moreover, the reconstruction-based contribution is derived for providing heuristic references when diagnosing multidimensional faults. Experiments on a numerical example and a simulated continuous stirred tank heater process benchmark are carried out to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

"Intelligent RUL prediction method of cutting tools based on GRU-LSTM As the executive part of metal processing, tool wear is closely related to the surface quality and machining accuracy of the workpiece. In recent years, many RUL prediction methods based on deep learning have emerged, but these methods still have some shortcomings, such as high model complexity, long running time, or because of the complexity of the processing system, using only a single sensor signal or a single model makes RUL prediction accuracy low. To overcome the above problems, this paper proposes a tool RUL prediction model based on GRU-LSTM (gated cycle unit long and short-term memory neural network). Firstly, the raw signal is sampled and processed, input into GRU for feature extraction, and then, the output of GRU is used as the input of LSTM for RUL prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated by comparing it with traditional GRU and LSTM.

"Vibration-based anomaly pattern mining for remaining useful life (RUL) prediction in bearings Predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of bearings is critical in ensuring rotating machinery’s reliability and maintenance efficiency. Most of the research in this domain focuses on the fault prognosis of bearings without proper investigation of underlying fault feature pattern mining for degradation analysis. This paper investigates the remaining operational lifespan of bearings with an enhanced feature selection strategy and anomaly monitoring of bearing operational data. Specifically, four different models, namely Bi-LSTM, CNN-LSTM, Conv_LSTM, and encoder-decoder LSTM, are utilized to capture complex temporal dependencies and spatial correlations in the bearing sensor data. In the first stage, various feature selection techniques are engaged to select degradation trend monitoring features over time-domain and frequency-domain analysis. Next, anomaly pattern mining techniques are employed to identify abnormal behavior in the data, a crucial input for the subsequent RUL forecasting models. The anomaly patterns are extracted using unsupervised learning methods such as clustering or autoencoders, enabling the detection of early signs of degradation. Subsequently, the RUL forecasting is performed using four deep learning architectures. The performance of the suggested technique is evaluated using a comprehensive dataset of sensor measurements from bearings, which includes the corresponding remaining useful life (RUL) values. The experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed models demonstrate high accuracy in correctly determining the RUL of bearings. This solution offers proactive and cost-effective maintenance procedures by employing advanced deep learning models and anomalous pattern mining techniques, resulting in increased reliability, reduced downtime, and optimized resource allocation. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering 2024.",2-s2.0-85190143774
"A novel spatio-temporal hybrid neural network for remaining useful life prediction Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is a crucial mission for the prognostic and health management (PHM) of machinery equipment in modern industry. Due to ignorance of the spatial relationship among multiple sensors, the current RUL prediction methods do not perform adequately in terms of accuracy and comprehensive performance. In order to improve the performance, this paper proposes a novel spatio-temporal hybrid neural network (STHNN) method to capture spatio-temporal features of the time sequence signals from multi-sensors at different locations on mechanical equipment. In this method, the spatial relationship among sensors is constructed by a sensor graph based on the cosine similarity among them. Spatial features of the sensor graph are then extracted by the improved residual graph attention module, which is the first part of the spatio-temporal hybrid neural network. As the second part of the STHNN, the Transformer encoder module is employed to obtain the temporal features. At the same time, this study proposes a new evaluation metric named as comprehensive evaluation function (CEF) to assess overall performance of the STHNN on the entire dataset. To confirm the accuracy and validity of the method, experiments are conducted on the commercial modular aero-propulsion system simulation (C-MAPSS) dataset.

"Fault detection method based on an automated operating envelope during transient states for the large turbomachinery In the energy generation business steam powered turbo-generators still play an important role in electrical power generation all over the world. Every facility using steam turbines considers them as the critical machinery. Such machines should be well-maintained, properly handled, and precisely diagnosed in order to achieve the best performance and safety. The most valued data about the technical health are collected during machine’s shut-downs and run-ups. These data are more than seldom and hard to assess without expert’s knowledge with strong theoretical background and experience. Main novelty of the paper is the automated method for novelty detection of machine’s vibration. Most proposed methods apply to smaller machines with rolling bearings, whereas we propose the method for large machines with sliding bearings, which have much different behavior. The application of the method is support of the plant maintenance staff to evaluate deviations of turbo-sets from a healthy state based on the concept which we called the Operating Envelope. The envelope is created based on the data from a vibration sensor during the transient state. In this paper we consider a single vibration sensor and only the first harmonic amplitude of this signal. To set the acceptance limits within which turbo-set’s dynamic response will be considered as acceptable, we used the cubic spline interpolation coupled with expert judgement. Beyond these limits the state of the turbo-set is considered as unhealthy, so it is an automated fault detection method. In such a case a machine should be a subject to further and deeper diagnostic analysis. The method was validated on the data from the 13K242 type (a 200 MW class turbine) steam turbine.

"Fault detection and isolation for multi-type sensors in nuclear power plants via a knowledge-guided spatial–temporal model Sensor faults in nuclear power plants (NPPs) have the potential to propagate negative impacts on system stability, leading to false alarms and accident misdiagnosis. Existing methods seldom concurrently consider complex spatial–temporal correlations among multi-type sensors in the primary circuit. This study presents a novel sensor fault detection and isolation scheme named the knowledge-guided spatial–temporal model (KGSTM), using the knowledge-guided recurrent unit (KGRU) and the concurrent detection strategy. To organically express part and whole interdependencies from inherent sensor layout, several graphs are specifically designed with pertinent domain knowledge. KGRU consists of the multi-graph convolutional network (MGCN) for fusing various spatial information and the gate recurrent unit (GRU) for extracting dynamic temporal features, further obtaining precise reconstructed signals and residuals. The concurrent detection strategy can explicitly quantify abnormal behaviors to detect and isolate faulty sensors by characterizing spatial–temporal signal variation.

"MIFDELN: A multi-sensor information fusion deep ensemble learning network for diagnosing bearing faults in noisy scenarios Owing to the harsh operating environment of rolling bearings, acquired vibration signals contain strong noise interference, which makes it challenging for conventional methods to effectively extract fault information directly from the original signal. Additionally, obtaining satisfactory diagnostic results using traditional methods based on a single sensor is often difficult because the complementary information between different sensors is ignored. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-sensor information fusion deep ensemble learning network (MIFDELN) for diagnosing bearing faults. First, the collected multi-sensor signals are organically fused using the weighted fusion strategy based on the composite index, which not only avoids the selection of poor-quality sensor signals but also suppresses part of the strong noise interference in the original signal. Second, the cross-scale attention feature extraction module (CAFEM) is presented to automatically learn discriminative features from the fused signals and reduce the impact of useless feature information through cross-scale learning and attentional weight enhancement. Subsequently, a weighted topology learning module (WTLM) is introduced to further excavate the spatial structure features and strengthen the distinctness of the learned features. Finally, the softmax classifier is employed to finalize the fault identification. Two experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach. The results indicated that the proposed approach performs best in extracting discriminating features with the highest accuracy and greatest robustness compared with several representative multi-sensor fusion technologies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",2-s2.0-85179888586

Whilst HUMS has proven to be effective in detecting gears’ defects, bearing failures are not adequately detected using current monitoring indicators. Detection of bearing faults in helicopter gearboxes is made challenging by the presence of the complicated signal transmission path attenuating the monitored signal to the receiving sensor. Purpose: To ensure safe operation of helicopters, this research proposes a novel condition indicator to detect bearing faults in helicopter gearboxes. Methods: For this purpose, vibration measurements captured from a CS-29 category ‘A’ helicopters test rig were utilized for detecting a bearing defect that has occurred in the epicyclic module of the main gearbox. Signals of rolling element bearings under various fault conditions were collected, and an adaptive filter algorithm was utilized to separate the random component of the signal.

Besides, the impulse energy indicator responds consistently to the fault severity compared to the traditional indicators such as RMS and kurtosis. Conclusion: A technique to extract frequency band corresponding to the bearing fault impulses has been developed and tested.

The key hardware and isolation circuit of the detection system were designed, which can effectively improve the stability and anti-interference ability in the process of vibration data acquisition and transmission with SPI and CAN bus communication scheme. In order to eliminate noise interference in friction vibration signal and improve the accuracy of fault diagnosis with advantage, wavelet threshold denoising method was applied to brake disc vibration signal processing. The denoised signal can be obtained by inverting the selected wavelet coefficients to separate the useful components of the signal from the invalid noise. For the research on the correlation between fault types and vibration signal characteristics, a friction vibration test bench for hydraulic braking system was built to obtain and process the output signal from vibration sensor. The frequency spectrum response laws of vibration signals were compared and analyzed when the brake disc was normal and had surface defects, including microcracks, excessive wear and fatigue peeling. The external parameters such as brake pressure and spindle speed were keeping constant, thus eliminating the influence of working factors on vibration characteristics. In order to study the influence of brake pressure failure on friction vibration, the variation law of vibration signal is compared and analyzed under the condition of hydraulic valve leakage and pressure maintaining failure. The results show that the friction vibration signal can be used as an effective basis for judging the surface defects and brake pressure faults of brake discs. Under the condition of wavelet threshold denoising, accurate and effective vibration parameters can be obtained, which is of great significance to the safety and reliability of the braking system. © 2023 Qiuhuan Ma, et al.",2-s2.0-85168242298
"From fault detection to anomaly explanation: A case study on predictive maintenance Predictive Maintenance applications are increasingly complex, with interactions between many components. Black-box models are popular approaches based on deep-learning techniques due to their predictive accuracy. This paper proposes a neural-symbolic architecture that uses an online rule-learning algorithm to explain when the black-box model predicts failures. The proposed system solves two problems in parallel: (i) anomaly detection and (ii) explanation of the anomaly. For the first problem, we use an unsupervised state-of-the-art autoencoder. For the second problem, we train a rule learning system that learns a mapping from the input features to the autoencoder's reconstruction error. Both systems run online and in parallel. The autoencoder signals an alarm for the examples with a reconstruction error that exceeds a threshold. The causes of the signal alarm are hard for humans to understand because they result from a non-linear combination of sensor data. The rule that triggers that example describes the relationship between the input features and the autoencoder's reconstruction error. The rule explains the failure signal by indicating which sensors contribute to the alarm and allowing the identification of the component involved in the failure. The system can present global explanations for the black box model and local explanations for why the black box model predicts a failure. We evaluate the proposed system in a real-world case study of Metro do Porto and provide explanations that illustrate its benefits. © 2024",2-s2.0-85193543680
"PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE USING RNN AND LSTM MODELS The art of farming is the oldest and challenging factor in human life. In this fast phased environment and with the increase in the destruction of atmosphere and other natural resources, it is very questionable to acquire quality crops.

"Observer-based fault detection and diagnosis strategy for industrial processes This study presents the design of a fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) scheme, composed from a bank of two types of observers, applied to linear parameter varying (LPV) systems.

"Adaptive fusion transfer learning-based digital multitwin-assised intelligent fault diagnosis With the development of digital twin technology, mechanical failures can be more comprehensively described through the interaction between sensors and twin models, which thereby demonstrate significant potential in fault diagnosis. However, due to the limitations of modeling methods, digital twin model construction poses challenges and exhibits poor generalization, making it difficult to apply across domains. To address these issues, this paper proposes a digital multitwin fusion diagnostic algorithm based on transfer learning. The digital multitwin comprise the source domain mechanistic twin, the target domain distributional feature 1D Auxiliary Classifier GAN (1D-ACGAN) twin, and the target domain time-series feature shared weight stacking LSTM (SWSLSTM) twin. First, based on the fault features collected by multiple sensors in the mechanism twin, a multichannel, multiscale mid-fusion diagnostic network is constructed. Second, the network is hierarchically transferred to the target domain network using a frozen transfer technique, automatically finding the optimal network parameters. Furthermore, to enhance the data quality, a data twin composed of the SWSLSTM twin and 1D-ACGAN twin is proposed to capture the dependency relationships of target domain data features. Finally, the migrated network adaptively adjusts the generated samples of the data twin based on the designed indicators, achieving high-precision cross-domain application of the multitwin diagnostic model. The proposed algorithm has been validated utilising data from triple-piston pumps and openly accessible bearing datasets, achieving diagnostic accuracies of 91.6% and 95.28%, respectively. These results substantiate the efficacy of the algorithm, demonstrating its superior generalisation capability and robustness in comparison to extant classical methodologies. © 2024",2-s2.0-85194344607
"Predictive maintenance applied to mission critical supercomputing environments: remaining useful life estimation of a hydraulic cooling system using deep learning Given the growth and availability of computing power, artificial intelligence techniques have been applied to industrial equipment and computing devices in order to identify abnormalities in operation and predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of equipment with superior performance than traditional predictive maintenance. In this sense, this research aims to develop a neural network applied to predictive maintenance in mission critical supercomputing environments (MCSE) using deep learning techniques to predict the RUL of an equipment before the occurrence of failures, by using real historical unlabeled data, which were collected by sensors installed in a supercomputing environment. The method was developed using a hybrid approach based on a combination of Fully Convolutional Neural Network, Long Short-Term Memory and Multilayer Perceptron. The results presented a Pearson R of 0.87, R2 of 0.77, Factor of 2 of 0.89, and Normalized mean square error of 0.79, considering the predicted RUL value and the observed RUL value for the pre-failure behavior moments of the equipment. Thus, we can conclude that the developed approach had good performance to predict the RUL, increasing the ability to anticipate the failure situation of the MCSE, further increasing its availability and operating time. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2-s2.0-85139114975
"A machine learning-based approach for detection of whirl instability and overheating faults in journal bearings using multi-sensor fusion method This study proposes a novel multi-sensor fusion-based monitoring technique for the detection of overheating and oil whirl instability faults. By using this method, multi-faults can be detected as soon as possible with the minimum number of sensors with high accuracy. This technique of monitoring uses two eddy current-type proximity probes in X–Y configuration and an embedded load cell in the housing under the Babbitt layer for measuring the fluctuations of oil pressure load. A test rig consisting of a rotor with a hydrodynamic journal bearing was built. For collected data, the parameters in the time and frequency domain are extracted for four conditions including health, oil whirl fault, overheating fault, and both faults simultaneously. In this study, the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) method is used for feature reduction, and then, obtained data are classified by a multi-class Naive Bayes classification model. Finally, the accuracy and sensitivity of the classifier are investigated and concluded that the proximity probe sensor is useful for the detection of overheating and oil whirl faults with high accuracy, but the load cell sensor just can accurately detect oil whirl fault. Accordingly, the proximity probe sensor can be used for overheating fault detection without a thermocouple sensor. Although load cell cannot detect overheating, it can be used for oil whirl fault detection. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.",2-s2.0-85148697064
"An integrated approach for anomaly detection in sensor and system data using soft sensors and cyclic monitoring Anomaly detection is crucial for maintaining the safety and reliability of industrial systems. However, effectively distinguishing between detected anomalies as signal errors or system faults can be challenging. This categorization presents a significant hurdle in isolating and managing faults. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel anomaly detection approach. The proposed approach leverages soft sensors and cyclic monitoring techniques to achieve improved anomaly detection. Specifically, it involves constructing soft sensors to aid in identifying the fault level, creating a parameter reconstruction space, and implementing cyclic monitoring to identify and evaluate fault parameters. The number of monitoring cycles serves as a basis for classifying faults into different levels.

"Trajectory tracking of an autonomous vehicle using immersion and invariance control An Immersion and Invariance [I & I] controller is designed to control the nonlinear lateral vehicle's motion, using the steering angle as the only input. Similar to most of the lateral vehicle's dynamics control law, the cornering stiffness parameters are involved in our proposed controller. Because of the tight relation between tire/road properties and the cornering stiffness parameters, they are not available from the outputs of the sensors and therefore, should be estimated for utilizing in the control law. An online data-driven identification is employed for estimating the cornering stiffness parameters. In addition, a robust model-based fault detection and approximation method in the presence of uncertainties via neural networks is presented. The performance of the obtained control law is investigated via simulation tests in different situations and in the presence of the disturbance. Moreover, some validation tests are performed using the CarSim software to show the effectiveness of our algorithm. © 2021 The Franklin Institute",2-s2.0-85116883347
"ANOMALY DETECTION IN THE TEMPERATURE OF AN AC MOTOR USING EMBEDDED MACHINE LEARNING The integration of machine learning solutions is becoming more prominent in the industry. In industrial maintenance, new approaches categorized under predictive maintenance primarily use machine learning to identify patterns that could lead to machine failures. However, in most cases, implementing a machine learning approach is very expensive regarding resources and experienced personnel. Therefore, this approach is usually more costly in some machines than replacing these faulty machines instead. This paper proposes a low-cost machine-learning approach to detect anomalies in a rotary machine by monitoring its casing temperature using EdgeImpulse to Train the model and a Raspberry Pico as the microcontroller. The project is divided into two phases. Data is collected to be used to train and test the model. The model is then deployed to the microcontroller and is connected to a sensor attached to the motor.

"Spectral proper orthogonal decomposition and machine learning algorithms for bearing fault diagnosis Vibration analysis has been extensively exploited for bearing fault diagnosis. However, signal acquisition is quite expensive since external hardware is required. Moreover, for inaccessible systems, vibration analysis is considered to be impracticable. Motor current signal analysis (MCSA) provides fault diagnosis feasibly without the use of sensors since motor current signals can be easily collected and gathered using inverters. However, besides the defect frequency signature, the motor current also carries the power supply frequency and other mechanical frequencies which may significantly increase the fault extraction complexity. In addition, the MCSA's overall performance remains behind to the vibration analysis, especially for external bearings installed outside the electric motors. In this paper, an intelligent algorithm for bearing fault diagnosis is suggested to enhance the external ball bearings condition monitoring. The presented approach is based on several methods, mainly maximal overlap discrete wavelet packet transform (MODWPT), spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD), time-domain features for feature extraction and random forest (RF), ensemble tree (ET) K-nearest neighbors (KNN), in addition to multi-class support vector machine (MSVM) as classifiers. For the first contribution, motor current and vibration data under several working conditions with artificial and real inner and outer ring defects are decomposed by MODWPT into several nodes. Thereafter, SPOD is used to calculate the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd energy spectra for each node and plots them in a three-dimensional sample distribution. SPOD extracts the dominating feature at each frequency from the raw signals. The second contribution consists mainly of two steps: feature extraction and classification. For feature extraction, feature matrices for each bearing state are obtained by applying three time-based features to each node obtained by MODWPT. Thereafter, for feature classification, KNN, ET, MSVM, and RF are used to calculate the classification accuracy and display confusion matrices. Compared to the modern signal processing technique “Accugram”, experimental results prove that the proposed approach is more efficient for detecting, identifying, and classifying bearing state under different operation modes. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.",2-s2.0-85173040777
"A gated graph convolutional network with multi-sensor signals for remaining useful life prediction With the advent of industry 4.0, multi-sensors are utilized to monitor the degradation process of machinery. When machinery operating, multi-sensor signals have potential relation with each other. However, existing deep-learning-based prognosis models are often limited by lacks of (1) considering temporal and spatial dependencies in multi-sensor signals collected from the dynamic and complex machinery system; (2) uncertainty quantification of remaining useful life (RUL) which plays an essential role in maintenance schedules and spare parts management. Therefore, how to fuse multi-sensor signals and manage uncertainty are two major concerns in deep-learning-based prognosis approaches with multi-sensor signals. To tackle these challenges, a gated graph convolutional network (GGCN) is developed for multi-sensor signal fusion and RUL prediction. Firstly, spatial–temporal graphs are constructed from multi-sensor signals as input of the prognosis model. Next, gated graph convolutional layers are built to accurately extract degradation features by simultaneously modeling the temporal and spatial dependencies in multi-sensor signals. Finally, the extracted features are fed into a quantile regression layer to estimate the RUL and its confidence interval. Experimental results on a simulated graph dataset, a bearing dataset from real wind farm, a turbofan engine dataset and a tool wear dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed GGCN-based prognosis framework. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2-s2.0-85133925120
"Diagnosis of rotating machinery based on improved convolutional neural networks with gray-level transformation A fault diagnosis method for the rotating machinery based on improved Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Gray-Level Transformation (GLT) is proposed to increase the accuracy of the recognition adopting the multiple sensors.

"A novel framework for motor bearing fault diagnosis based on multi-transformation domain and multi-source data Through the application of deep learning and multi-sensor data, fault features can be automatically extracted and valuable information can be integrated to tackle intricate challenges in motor bearing fault diagnosis. Most existing fusion models focus primarily on the original time series signal with information extraction largely restricted to the time domain (without extensions into multiple transformation domains). Also, in most fusion models, the sensor fusion level is kept relatively simple which could lead to the oversight of correlations and complementarities among the information. To enhance the recognition capability of diagnostic network features, in this paper, we propose a novel framework for motor bearing fault diagnosis from the perspectives of multi-transformation domain and multi-source data fusion. Within this framework, feature extraction and fusion from various source data are achieved in the time domain, frequency domain, and time–frequency domain. Distinct independent networks are set up within these domains: one network is designated for overseeing feature fusion, while the others are dedicated to extracting features from individual sensors. To support the extraction of pivotal features across multiple fusion layers in various transformation domains, several fusion nodes are inserted between the layers of the multiple feature extraction networks and the feature summarization network. Furthermore, a channel attention mechanism is introduced as a fusion strategy that serves to pinpoint the significance of different features, thus enhancing the efficiency of feature extraction. Experimental evaluation reveals the efficacy of the proposed model and highlights its noteworthy performance attributes such as scalability and universality. © 2023",2-s2.0-85177488887
"Fault Detection and Diagnosis for Thrust Drop of Launch Vehicles Against Disturbances Rapid detection and accurate diagnosis for thrust drop fault are still open problems for launch vehicles. Existing studies have achieved fruitful results in fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) methods, leaving the complex disturbances not fully considered. The disturbances degrade FDD performance and are very hard to identify. In this paper, an FDD method based on multiple deep neural networks is proposed, which can deal with the complex disturbances. First, we split the FDD into two parts to reduce complexity. In detail, a fully connected neural network is selected to detect fault and diagnose fault degree, and a long short-term memory neural network is carefully tuned to diagnose fault mode. An analysis of the relationship between flight states and fault conditions is employed to design input of the fully connected neural network and the long short-term memory neural network. Then, a novel prediction and compensation method is proposed to deal with the unobservable and time-varying disturbances. Without extra information, data from the inertial measurement unit and navigation system are just enough to eliminate the disturbances, whereas existing methods may need more sensors. At last, illustrative simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed method. © 2023, AIAA International. All rights reserved.",2-s2.0-85162882785

"Stockwell Transform of Quadrature Stator Current-Based Fault Assessment in Induction Machine at Different Load Condition Introduction: Conventional sensor-based fault detection techniques lead to huge manpower, high cost and requires a greater number of sensors. To overcome these flaws, current signature-based fault estimation is proposed. This method does not require any additional current sensors and is done with existed sensors employed for motor speed control. Further, the stator current is divided into two phase currents using Parks vector approach to get better resolution. The higher order noise due to data acquisition, EMI and other sources is removed using wavelet de-noising and the resolution on current spectrum is improved using advanced spectral analysis namely Stockwell Transform (ST). All the faults faced by induction motor like bearing damage, broken rotor, and stator inter turn faults are tested at different load conditions. The severity of the fault is identified using feature parameters like RMS and Standard Deviation of stator current after proposed signal processing. A 1.5 KW, 440 V and 50 Hz induction motor is used for expermental verification of proposed fault assessment criteria. Purpose: The present work attempts a novel approch to estimate incipient faults in Induction motor using motor current signature analysis (MCSA). Methods: Advanced spectral analysis namely Stockwell Transform (ST) along with Park’s vector approch technique has been adopted to diagnosis the various faults in induction motor (IM) using MCSA. Result and Conclusions: The proposed fault indexing parameters (FIP) with selected features like RMS and SD is successful in estimating the fault severity and its behaviour.

"Intrinsic Fault Resistance for Nonlinear Filters with State-Dependent Probability of Detection The probability of detection can be thought of as the probability that a given measurement scan contains a valid, target-oriented return. In most systems, the detection probability is inherently a function of the state, which can make forming closed-form filtering solutions exceedingly difficult. Oftentimes, closed-form filters will either neglect the probability of detection outright, or in some cases may approximate it as state-independent. Both assumptions simplify calculations, yet bar the filter from extracting any state-information from the probability of detection. This work seeks to reevaluate current estimation practices by testing and comparing several probability of detection models of varying fidelity. This is done by proposing a filter update with intrinsic fault resistance capable of processing multiple sensor returns contained within a single measurement scan. Three different methods of detection probability modeling are described, which are subsequently used to form three distinct Gaussian mixture filters. To test the filters, Monte Carlo results are taken from two different simulations: the first a simple falling body tracking scenario, and the second a more complex orbit determination scenario. The results from both simulations indicate that including detection probabilities, even when modeled incorrectly, can increase filter robustness, and will improve estimate uncertainty if modeled as state-dependent. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to American Astronautical Society.",2-s2.0-85143364698
"Fault diagnosis study of mine drainage pump based on MED–WPD and RBFNN Mine drainage pumps typically operate in the strong background noise environment of underground coal mines, and the vibration sensor is usually mounted outside the pump housing. This makes the large values noise and the high-frequency noise contained in the vibration signals. The energy of the early weak fault vibration signal gradually decays in a complex transmission path and is finally drowned out by strong background noise. Therefore, the extraction of fault features for mine drainage pumps is difficult. To solve this problem, a fault diagnosis method of mine drainage pumps based on minimum entropy deconvolution (MED)–wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is proposed. First, the vibration signal is noise-reduced by the MED to reduce noise interference, and the fault signal characteristics are highlighted. Then, the noise-reduced signal is analyzed and processed by WPD, and each fault feature is extracted. Finally, the above fault characteristics are fused with the temperature and pressure signals. The RBFNN is trained by the above eigenvectors, and the test arrays are input into the trained RBFNN to obtain fault diagnosis results. The research result shows that the method has a high recognition accuracy, with a recognition accuracy of 94.44%, and the types of faults in mine drainage equipment can be effectively identified. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.",2-s2.0-85161295167

"Decision-making for the anomalies in IIoTs based on 1D convolutional neural networks and Dempster–Shafer theory (DS-1DCNN) The main motivation of the Internet of Things (IoT) is to enable everyday physical objects to sense and process data and communicate with other objects. Its applications in industry are called industrial Internet of Things (IIoTs) or Industry 4.0. One of the main goals of the IIoT is to automatically monitor and detect unexpected events, changes, and alterations to the collected data. Anomaly detection includes all techniques that identify data patterns deviating from the expected behavior. Deep learning (DL) can search for a specific relationship in billions of corporate IoT data and reach a meaningful goal by analyzing and classifying collected data, leading to making the right decisions. The realization of the IoT is entirely dependent on making the proper decisions. However, the conventional methods for processing voluminous IIoT data are not qualified. Hence, DL is indispensable for making the intended inferences through big IIoT data. Likewise, due to the advancement of sensor technology, various sensor resources such as sound, vibration, and current can be used to obtain appropriate inferences. Accordingly, the decision fusion theory can be used to make optimal decisions when there are multiple sources of information. Therefore, this paper proposes a method that combines one-dimensional convolution neural networks (1DCNNs) and the Dempster–Shafer (DS) decision-fusion method (DS-1DCNN) for decision-making on IIoT anomalies.

"Leak-Before-Break Main Failure Prevention for Water Distribution Pipes Using Acoustic Smart Water Technologies: Case Study in Adelaide Water main breaks in city areas can cause significant economic loss, interrupt traffic, and result in negative publicity for utilities. The South Australian Water Corporation (SA Water) has taken a proactive approach to reduce water main breaks in the Adelaide, Australia, central business district (CBD) by detecting developing pipe cracks/leaks using distributed acoustic sensors (accelerometers) with customized analytics and internet of things (IoT) technologies. This paper reports the findings and the outcomes of this initiative 24 months after the first commissioning of the continuous leak detection system. The acoustic data analytics team (comprising the authors) has successfully interpreted acoustic data from numerous cracked pipes in the Adelaide CBD, with approximately 55% of all developing leaks associated with cracked pipes being able to be detected before uncontrolled failure (i.e., before unplanned interruption of customers and/or third party economic damage). Furthermore, the localization and repair of specific cracks (sometimes through sections of corroded cast iron pipe walls) can help justify extending the service life of the water main as points of weakness (faults) are specifically rectified.

"CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK BASED RASPBERRY CONTROLLER FOR THE GREENHOUSE MONITORING SYSTEM The greenhouse monitoring system is a smart approach to monitoring and controlling the greenhouse environment with the regular monitoring of indoor carbon dioxide, humidity, soil moisture, temperature, soil ph level, and light, smoke,and air pressure. Internet of Things (IoT) based sensors are the fundamental components of green monitoring systems and can be utilized in horticulture, agriculture, and many other fields. The IoT-based sensors sense small deviations in the values and forward the signals to the controller to manage the respective switch and make corrections at right time and is a complicated task and to tackle this complication we propose a novel Raspberry pi controller based green monitoring system which includes IoT sensors for the monitoring of light, temperature, smoke, soil moisture, LCD module, 12V DC fan, LDR sensor, pump, and bulb. The smoke sensor will sense if any smoke coming from the electric connection and send an alert message by turning on the alarm, the temperature can be sensed with the temperature sensor and if it measures high then the DC fans are automatically switched on and off if it goes low. The water level in the soil can be sensed by the soil moisture sensor and automatically the pumps get on.The light gets turned on when the LDR sensor senses the absence of light and the status of the monitoring system can be forwarded each 30 sec using the GSM module sensing data from different sensors are detected and analyzed with the proposed Dilated Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) based Fire Hawk Optimization (FHO) algorithm.

"Fault diagnosis and identification of rotating machinery based on one-dimensional convolutional neural network The paper focuses on two kinds of rotating machinery, miniature table drilling machine and automobile engine, as the research object. Traditional machine learning has the need for manual feature extraction, and is very dependent on expert diagnostic experience and expertise, but also has the disadvantages of low accuracy, low timeliness, low efficiency, etc. For the traditional rotating machinery fault diagnosis method is more based on the traditional machine learning model, this paper puts forward a one-dimensional convolutional neural network-based fault identification method. According to the characteristics of the miniature table drilling machine and the automobile engine which are not detachable, the corresponding faults are set up respectively, Vibration signals of the attitude sensor are obtained by using the signal collector, and the collected data are preprocessed, then the CNN model is built for fault identification, and the network structure is constantly optimized to obtain the optimal network model with high accuracy (up to 100 %) and robustness.

"Fault diagnosis method of hydraulic system based on multi-source information fusion and fractal dimension Considering nonlinear characteristics of the signals measured by multiple sensors in a hydraulic system, a novel fault diagnosis method of the hydraulic system based on multi-source information fusion and fractal dimension is proposed which mainly includes multi-source information’s feature extraction and sample construction methods. First, the sensor signals dealt with wavelet transform are decomposed into a finite number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by ensemble empirical mode decomposition, and the top five IMFs with more characteristic information are determined. Then, a Grassberger-Procaccia-based algorithm is proposed to calculate the fractal dimension of the IMFs under different embedding dimensions. After that, considering the change laws of fractal dimensions with embedding dimensions, third-order tensor samples of the sensor signals are constructed.

"Structural Damage Identification Based on Convolutional Neural Network Group Considering the Sensor Fault This article proposes a structural damage identification method based on one-dimensional convolutional neural network group considering sensor faults. The method aims to reduce the damage misjudgment caused by sensor faults. In the proposed method, according to the sensor layout, some convolutional neural network sub-models are established to extract the features from raw vibration data for sensor fault diagnosis and structural damage identification; then two convolutional neural networks groups, namely the sensor fault diagnosis group and the damage identification group are designed on the basis of the functions of each sub-model. The sensor fault diagnosis group determines whether the sensor data is abnormal and truncates the abnormal signal. The remaining normal signal are entered into the damage identification group and the final damage identification results are calculated according to the statistical decision module. The effectiveness of the devised method is verified by the IASC-ASCE benchmark structure and laboratory experiments. The results demonstrate that the sensor fault diagnosis and damage identification accuracy of each sub-model ranges from 98.54% to 99.77% and from 87.21% to 91.74% respectively at different noise levels; the damage identification group can reduce the impact of sub-model misjudgment on the structural damage identification.

"Engine Misfire Diagnosis Based on the Torsional Vibration of the Flexible Coupling in a Diesel Generator Set: Simulation and Experiment Purpose: Flexible couplings are widely used for accommodating various imprecisions such as misalignments and torque fluctuations in a diesel generator set. However, excessive vibration due to common engine misfires can cause premature failures in both the couplings and the whole generator set. Moreover, the coupling also affects detection performance and the occurrences of early misfires due to such faults in fuel injections and cylinder seals. In this paper, the torsional vibration along with the dynamic torque of the flexible coupling connecting a 6-cylinder diesel engine to a dynamometer is studied theoretically and experimentally. Methods: This system represents a common diesel generator set which is modeled into a torsional dynamic system with 10-degree of freedom (DOF) by the Lagrange equation method. After a verification of the model by the measurement of vibration responses at the free end and the coupling with a magnetic speed sensor and a wireless torque sensor, it is then used to predict the influences of different misfire conditions on the dynamic torque on the coupling, which helps in determining reliable diagnostic features for misfire detection and diagnosis. Results and Conclusions: Results show that the misfires of the diesel engine have significant influences (more than 5 times higher) on the torsional vibration and load of the flexible coupling than on the dynamic torque. Nevertheless, both the torsional vibration and torque of the flexible coupling can be used to detect the occurrence of the diesel engine misfires and the vibration provides slight better results in terms of localizing the misfired cylinders. © 2019, Krishtel eMaging Solutions Private Limited.",2-s2.0-85070835108

"Multivariate time series generation based on dual-channel Transformer conditional GAN for industrial remaining useful life prediction Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is a key enabler of predictive maintenance. While deep learning based prediction methods have made great progress, the data imbalance issue caused by limited run-to-failure data severely undermines their performance. Some recent works employ generative adversarial network (GAN) to tackle this issue. However, most GAN-based generative methods have difficulties in simultaneously extracting correlations of different time steps and sensors. In this paper, we propose dual-channel Transformer conditional GAN (DCTC-GAN), a novel multivariate time series (MTS) generation framework, to generate high-quality MTS to enhance deep learning based RUL prediction models. We design a novel dual-channel Transformer architecture to construct the generator and discriminator, which consists of a temporal encoder and a spatial encoder that work in parallel to automatically pay different attention to different time steps and sensors. Based on this, DCTC-GAN can directly extract the long-distance temporal relations of different time steps while capturing the spatial correlations of different sensors to synthesize high-quality MTS data. Experimental analysis on widely used turbofan engine dataset and FEMTO bearing dataset demonstrates that our DCTC-GAN significantly enhances the performance of existing deep learning models for RUL prediction, without changing its structure, and exceeds the capabilities of current representative generative methods. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",2-s2.0-85209894525
"Fault detection based on adaptive interval observer and its application in aeroengine This paper is concerned with the problem of sensor fault detection (FD) for discrete-time linear systems. First, considering the influence of disturbance, an adaptive law is designed based on the interval observer theory, which can effectively compress the error interval of output estimation, and improve the sensitivity to sudden faults. Then, based on adaptive interval observer (AIO), a flexible event-triggering fault detection mechanism is designed. Different from the existing methods, the event-triggering condition has greater flexibility. At the same time, the adaptive law can ensure that the zero signal belongs to the upper and lower bound of residual. Based on the robustness theory, the linear matrix inequality conditions (LMIs) satisfying the H∞ performance index are derived.

"Remaining useful life prognostics based on stochastic degradation modeling: turbofan engine as case study Monitoring the system's health status by utilizing multiple sensors concurrently and fusion of their information will be effective for assessing the system's degradation process. Due to the complexity of degradation modeling and high-dimensional run-to-failure data, fusion at different levels will be more helpful. The main goal of this paper is to suggest a prognostics fusion scheme to model the deterioration trend of the system and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction. Moreover, this stochastic degradation modeling is done according to a combination of the Gamma stochastic process and accelerated models, closer to reality. To model the deterioration trend of the system, degradation data from multiple sensors is utilized. Also, the sensor selection is based on the trendability and monotonicity of the sensors. After that, the KPCA method extracts features based on those selected sensors to fit a nonlinear regression model to construct the health indices to feed the model. Consequently, using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation, the model parameters are estimated. Eventually, the statistical profile of the estimated RUL is indicated by Probability Density Function is proposed to fit the probability distribution based on proposed statistical modeling. This methodology consists of fusion at both sensor-level and feature-level to utilize their properties simultaneously.

"Enhancing Interpretability of Data-Driven Fault Detection and Diagnosis Methodology with Maintainability Rules in Smart Building Management Data-driven fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) methods, referring to the newer generation of artificial intelligence (AI) empowered classification methods, such as data science analysis, big data, Internet of things (IoT), industry 4.0, etc., become increasingly important for facility management in the smart building design and smart city construction. While data-driven FDD methods nowadays outperform the majority of traditional FDD approaches, such as the physically based models and mathematically based models, in terms of both efficiency and accuracy, the interpretability of those methods does not grow significantly. Instead, according to the literature survey, the interpretability of the data-driven FDD methods becomes the main concern and creates barriers for those methods to be adopted in real-world industrial applications. In this study, we reviewed the existing data-driven FDD approaches for building mechanical & electrical engineering (M&E) services faults and discussed the interpretability of the modern data-driven FDD methods. Two data-driven FDD strategies integrating the expert reasoning of the faults were proposed.

"Privacy-preserving federated learning for proactive maintenance of IoT-empowered multi-location smart city facilities The widespread adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) and deep learning (DL) have facilitated a social paradigm shift towards smart cities, accelerating the rapid construction of smart facilities. However, newly constructed facilities often lack the necessary data to learn any predictive models, preventing them from being truly smart. Additionally, data collected from different facilities is heterogeneous or may even be privacy-sensitive, making it harder to train proactive maintenance management (PMM) models that are robust to provide services across them. These properties impose challenges that have not been adequately addressed, especially at the city level. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving, federated learning (FL) framework that can assist management personnel to proactively manage the maintenance schedule of IoT-empowered facilities in different organizations through analyzing heterogeneous IoT data. Our framework consists of (1) an FL platform implemented with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) for training DL models with time-series heterogeneous IoT data and (2) an FL-based long short-term memory autoencoder model, namely FedLSTMA, for facility-level PMM. To evaluate our framework, we did extensive simulations with real-world data harvested from IoT-empowered public toilets, demonstrating that the DL-based FedLSTMA outperformed other traditional machine learning (ML) algorithms and had a high level of generalizability and capabilities of transferring knowledge from existing facilities to newly constructed facilities under the situation of huge data heterogeneity.

"Sensor network design based on system-wide reliability criteria. Part I: Objectives Reliability based criteria are quite popular for optimal sensor network design. We present a modified definition of system reliability for sensor network design for two applications: reliable estimation of variables in a steady state linear flow process, and reliable fault detection and diagnosis for any process. Unlike the weakest-link based definition of system reliability in the literature, the proposed definition considers the entire system and is consistent with the reliability concept used in classical reliability literature. For each application, dual approaches for defining system reliability are proposed, and their analogy with the reliability problem in the classical reliability literature is established. Using examples and stochastic simulations, the advantage of using the proposed system reliability in contrast to the existing definition is illustrated.

"Industrial process fault detection based on deep highly-sensitive feature capture With the rapid development of sensor and computer technology, deep learning has received extensive attention in the field of fault detection with powerful nonlinear feature extraction capabilities. However, the feature extracted by deep learning contains different fault information volume. Fault detection performance would be affected by features with less fault information. Motivated by this, the deep high-dimensional features extracted from the deep belief network are analyzed, and an index for measuring fault information volume is proposed to select the deep highly-sensitive feature (DHSF) with a large amount of fault information volume as the feature to be detected. Based on DHSFs, Euclidean distance is used for fault detection, and the moving average window function is used to reduce burst noise interference and improve detection performance.

"Sensor fault self-detection based on the mean shift method; [基于均值漂移方法的传感器故障自检测] To accurately identify sensor faults caused by complex environmental conditions and ensure that structural health monitoring systems correctly perceive the structural state, a self-detection method for sensor nodes based on mean shift and sliding window techniques was proposed. The self-detection method comprises two stages, i. e., fault prescreening and fault self-detection. During the fault prescreening stage, the method rapidly identifies potentially abnormal data using the quartile method combined with the sliding window technique, significantly improving the efficiency of the method. During the fault self-detection stage, the method employs the mean shift algorithm to perform adaptive clustering of the abnormal data, effectively detecting various faults. Data from the Canton Tower were used to test the effectiveness of the method by setting four types of sensor faults, i. e., offset, drift, gain, and stuck. Then, the proposed method was compared with extremely randomized trees, random forests, support vector data description, and one-class support vector machines. Results show that the proposed method can detect the four aforementioned faults with high accuracy and computational efficiency. © 2024 Southeast University. All rights reserved.",2-s2.0-85196869914
"Dissipativity-based distributed fault diagnosis for plantwide chemical processes Most modern chemical processes consist of a number of process units interconnected with mass and energy flows, often with energy integration and materials recycle loops. As such, faults (process faults, actuator faults, or sensor faults) often propagate to multiple process units (subsystems), causing significant difficulties in fault diagnosis for plantwide systems. In this paper, a general distributed fault diagnosis approach is proposed for plantwide chemical processes, which takes into account the interactions among process units. The distributed fault diagnostic observers are designed to be sensitive to the local faults (local sensitivity) and insensitive to faults in other process units (remote faults insensitivity) and disturbances. The above requirements are formulated as plantwide dissipativity conditions and the gains for the distributed estimators and residual generators are obtained offline by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. A case study of heat exchanger network is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85094855037

"RFLS - Resilient Fault-proof Localization System in IoT and Crowd-based Sensing Applications In this paper, we consider the problem of event localization in the presence of anomalous nodes, in Internet of Things (IoT) and Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS) systems. A sensing node could be anomalous due to faultiness in any of its components, or due to maliciousness, where it may forge and inject false readings. In both cases, anomalous nodes can significantly alter the task quality and outcome, which may lead to catastrophic consequences, especially in sensitive applications. The current localization systems are not designed to account for the probability of having anomalous readings, hence subjecting them to high errors. Additionally, current anomaly detection systems are not well suited for localization tasks because they are neither dynamic nor continuous, and they do not account for the radial-spreading patterns of data in localization tasks. To overcome these challenges, a Resilient Fault-proof Localization System (RFLS) is proposed, which a) includes an anomaly detection process designed specifically for localization tasks using means of data-based clustering and centroiding, b) dynamically integrates greedy- and genetic-based active nodes selection, Bayesian-based data fusion, and anomaly detection processes in one full localization system, and c) assesses and updates the nodes’ reputations to ensure better performance in future tasks. The efficacy of the proposed system is validated by running experiments for single and sequential localization tasks, for varying conditions, and by using a real-life dataset of the vehicular mobility traces in the city of Cologne, Germany. The results demonstrate that anomalous nodes are efficiently detected, eliminated, and penalized, which in turn greatly improves the accuracy of the localization tasks. © Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85090117142

"Thermal fault detection and localization framework for large format batteries Safety against thermal failures is crucial in battery systems. Real-time thermal diagnostics can be a key enabler of such safer batteries. Thermal fault diagnostics in large format pouch or prismatic cells pose additional challenges compared to cylindrical cells. These challenges arise from the fact that the temperature distribution in large format cells is at least two-dimensional in nature (along length and breadth) while such distribution can be reasonably approximated in one dimension (along radial direction) in cylindrical cells. This difference makes the placement of temperature sensor(s) non-trivial and the design of detection algorithm challenging.

However, limited by the architecture characteristics, software and hardware characteristics, and complex external environmental factors of wireless sensor networks, there are often serious abnormalities in the monitoring data of wireless sensor networks, which further affect the judgment and response of users. Based on this, this paper optimizes and improves the fault detection algorithm of related abnormal data analysis in wireless sensor networks from two angles and verifies the algorithm at the same time. In the first level, aiming at the problem of insufficient spatial cooperation faced by the network abnormal data detection level, this paper first establishes a stable neighbor screening model based on the wireless network and filters and analyzes the reliability of the network cooperative data nodes and then establishes the detection data stability evaluation model by using the spatiotemporal correlation corresponding to the data nodes.

"Experimental validation of an interval observer-based sensor fault detection strategy applied to a biohydrogen production dark fermenter In this paper, the problem of designing an interval observer applied to a biohydrogen production dark fermenter is addressed, in order to: (i) estimate the glucose and biomass concentrations, and the hydrogen flow rate produced, (ii) reduce the influence of the unknown inlet glucose concentration and the model uncertainties, and (iii) detect the presence of faults in the hydrogen flow rate sensor. Based on literature reports, we propose an interval observer structure, constituted by a Luenberger observer and an interval predictor, for a class of linear systems. The interval observer offers three estimations: the upper and lower estimations provided by the interval predictor, and one estimation given by the Luenberger observer. The upper and lower estimations provide bounds at any instant of time for the state vector of the perturbed/uncertain biohydrogen production bioreactor model from an appropriate initial condition. The design conditions presented in this work are based on control H∞ in combination with pole placement and polytopic parametric uncertainties. The observer design is proposed as a semi-definite optimization problem subject to Linear Matrix Inequalities, which do not depend on the cooperativity property. Based on the proposed observer structure, we also present two fault detection schemes for the same class of uncertain systems to detect the occurrence of sensor faults: one makes use of the logic comparison between the set threshold and the residual produced by the Luenberger observer; the other considers adaptive thresholds for the output signal by using the upper and lower estimates of the interval predictor.

"Determining Smart Phone Sensing and K-Means Clustering for Accurate and Timely Railway Track Joint Fault Diagnosis The railway track joint is an important component that connects two sections of the rail and ensures a smooth and safe operation of trains. However, the joint is also a critical point of failure that can lead to train derailments and accidents. Therefore, accurate and timely detection of joint faults is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of railway transportation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for railway track joint fault diagnosis using smart phone sensing and k-means clustering. Our approach utilizes the accelerometer sensor of a smart phone to measure the vibrations and movements of a specifically developed railway shoe stick that is employed on an actual railway track for the condition monitoring of the railway tracks. More than 60000 data values are collected and are then processed and analysed using k-means clustering, a popular unsupervised machine learning technique that groups similar data points together. The K means clustering in this study forms 3 clusters as a result. The 3 clusters after being validated on the track by virtue of visual inspection are determined to be acceleration values of the healthy track, track with higher joint gap than the standardized value and super-elevated railway track joint fault(s), respectively. In addition to its high accuracy and efficiency, our approach has several advantages over traditional methods, such as low cost, easy deployment, and high scalability. Moreover, the smart phone sensing technology can be easily integrated with existing train monitoring systems, making it a useful tool for real-time joint fault diagnosis and maintenance.

Unusual sensor readings, such as high temperature, excessive vibration, or low current, could trigger rule-based actions (also known as faults) that range from warning alarms to immediate shutdown of the asset to prevent potential damage. In the case study of this article, a wind park experienced a sudden surge in vibration-induced shutdowns. We utilize fault data logs from the park with the goal of detecting common change points across turbines. Another important goal is the localization of fault occurrences to an identifiable set of turbines. The literature on change point detection and localization for multiple assets is highly sparse. Our technical development is based on the generalized linear modeling framework. We combine well-known solutions to change point detection for a single asset with a heuristics-based approach to identify a common change point(s) for multiple assets. The performance of the proposed detection and localization algorithms is evaluated through synthetic (Monte Carlo) fault data streams. Several novel performance metrics are defined to characterize different aspects of a change point detection algorithm for multiple assets. For the case study example, the proposed methodology identified the change point and the subset of affected turbines with a high degree of accuracy. The problem described here warrants further study to accommodate general fault distributions, change point detection algorithms, and very large fleet sizes. © 2021 American Society for Quality.",2-s2.0-85109097858
"Data-based decomposition plant for decentralized monitoring schemes: A comparative study The complexity of the industrial processes, large-scale plants and the massive use of distributed control systems and sensors are challenges which open ways for alternative monitoring systems. The decentralized monitoring methods are one option to deal with these complex challenges. These methods are based on process decomposition, i.e., dividing the plant variables into blocks, and building statistical data models for every block to perform local monitoring. After that, the local monitoring results are integrated through a decision fusion algorithm for a global output concerning the process. However, decentralized process monitoring has to deal with a critical issue: a proper process decomposition, or block division, using only available data. Knowledge of the plant is rarely available, so data-driven approaches can help to manage this issue. Moreover, this is the first and key step to developing decentralized monitoring models and several alternative approaches are available. In this work a comparative study is carried out regarding decentralized fault monitoring methods, comparing several alternative proposals for process decomposition based on data. These methods are based on information theory, regression and clustering, and are compared in terms of their monitoring performance. When the blocks are obtained, CVA (Canonical Variate Analysis) based local dynamic monitors are set up to characterize the local process behavior, while also considering the dynamic nature of the industrial plants. Finally, the Bayesian Inference Index (BII) is implemented, based on these local monitoring, to achieve a global outcome regarding fault detection for the whole process. To further compare their performance from the application viewpoint, the Tennessee Eastman (TE) process, a well-known industrial benchmark, is used to illustrate the efficiencies of all the discussed methods. So, a systematically comparison have been carried out involving different data-driven methods for process decomposition to implement a decentralized monitoring scheme. The results are focused on providing a reference for practitioners as guidelines for successful decentralized monitoring strategies. © 2024 The Author(s)",2-s2.0-85184766297
"Improved data-driven root cause analysis in fog computing environment Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing are used in many real-time smart applications such as smart health-care, smart traffic, smart city, and smart industries. Fog computing has been introduced as an intermediate layer to reduce communication delay between cloud and IoT Devices. To improve performance of these smart applications, a predictive maintenance system needs to adopt anomaly detection and root cause analysis model that helps to resolve anomalies and avoid such anomalies in future. The state-of-art work on data-driven root cause analysis suffers from scalability, accuracy, and interpretability. In this paper, a multi-agent-based improved data-driven root cause analysis technique is introduced to identify anomalies and its root cause. Multiple agents are used to perform various operations like data collection, anomaly detection, and root cause analysis. The deep learning model LSTM autoencoder is used to find the anomalies, and a game theory approach called SHAP algorithm is used to find the root cause of the anomaly.

"Digital Twin Based Virtual Sensor for Online Fatigue Damage Monitoring in Offshore Wind Turbine Drivetrains In this article a virtual sensor for online load monitoring and subsequent remaining useful life (RUL) assessment of wind turbine gearbox bearings is presented. Utilizing a Digital Twin framework the virtual sensor combines data from readily available sensors of the condition monitoring (CMS) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system with a physics-based gearbox model. Different state estimation methods including Kalman filter, Least-square estimator, and a quasi-static approach are employed for load estimation. For RUL assessment the accumulated fatigue damage is calculated with the Palmgren–Miner model. A case study using simulation measurements from a high-fidelity gearbox model is conducted to evaluate the proposed method. Estimated loads at the considered intermediate and high-speed shaft bearings show moderate to high correlation (R = 0.50 - 0.96) to measurements, as lower frequency internal dynamics are not fully captured. The estimated fatigue damage differs by 5–15% from measurements. Copyright © 2022 by ASME.",2-s2.0-85143943312
"Open-Switch Fault Tolerance Strategy for Induction Motor Drive System Voltage source inverters (VSIs) based on insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) may face various faults that can affect the operation and safety of the entire electric drive system. To enhance the reliability of the drive system, it is crucial to develop an accurate fault diagnosis (FD) method and increase fault tolerance control (FTC) capabilities. This paper provides a novel FTC strategy for IGBT open circuit fault (OCF) in induction motor (IM) drives. The proposed FTC strategy includes a fault diagnosis algorithm and inverter reconfiguration. A three-phase current-based diagnosis method (FD) is adopted in this research, where the average absolute value of the normalized currents is used to extract fault detection variables. The developed FD method does not need any extra sensors and provides fast diagnosis time, which is equivalent to almost 25-30% of the phase current’s fundamental cycle. To accomplish satisfactory post-fault operation of the IM drive, a four-leg inverter topology is employed.

"Hybrid method for multi-rate refined oil pumping station system unsteady state estimation with bad data attacks With the recent advancement of products pipelines digitization, a large number of sensors have been installed in pumping stations for real-time flow parameters measurement. In these asynchronous multi-sensor systems, data missing and false data attacks are likely to occur when performing online operation monitoring of the oil pipeline system. In this paper, a hybrid state estimation method is proposed to process both the missing and fault measurement, considering the dynamic operation process of the whole system. Combing frequency-domain analysis method with model-free adaptive control algorithm, the state estimation model with adaptive deviation compensation is established to characterize the nonlinear transient flow process of the pumping station. And the Kalman Filter method is adopted to overcome the interference of sensor noise. In terms of multi-rate observation data processing, this study innovatively proposes an algorithm based on the first principle and generalized predictive control theory to improve the accuracy of traditional missing data processing methods based on statistical analysis. Moreover, non-obvious abnormal observations are identified by introducing long short-term memory network characterized by deviations between sensor measurements and multi-rate state estimation results. To verify the effectiveness of proposed method, it is adopted to the unsteady state estimation of a refined oil pumping station system under the attack of noise, nonuniform asynchronous sampling and insignificant abnormal data. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85180543372
"Equipment for Monitoring Synchronous Generators Condition through External Magnetic Field Waveforms This paper presents an equipment for monitoring synchronous generators condition through characteristics of the time derivative of the external magnetic field.

"Multimodal recognition and prognostics based on features extracted via multisensor degradation modeling Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is an important issue in prognostics and health management (PHM). Numerous studies have been conducted to construct degradation models for RUL prediction. However, their models fail to handle the scenarios where multiple failure modes exist, especially when the failure modes are unknown (unlabeled) beforehand and need to be recognized. This paper develops a multimodal recognition and prognostic method based on features extracted via multisensor degradation modeling. Specifically, we assume the failure mode of a unit follows a multinomial distribution. Given the failure mode distribution, we characterize the degradation status of the unit via degradation models based on each sensor signal and a constructed health index (HI). Our innovative idea is to extract features as the derivatives of the degradation status to comprehensively utilize information from multiple sensors for more effective failure mode recognition and RUL prediction. We develop a fusion coefficient-integrated expectation-maximization (FCIEM) algorithm to estimate model parameters by using data from historical units. Finally, we recognize the failure mode and predict the RUL of in-service units based on their extracted features and degradation status. Numerical experiments and a case study of aircraft engines were conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed method. © 2024 American Society for Quality.",2-s2.0-85195671799
"Imaging of Closed Cracks by Water-Coupled Sensor Array Based on Nonlinear Lamb Waves Nonlinear waves have shown higher sensitivity to closed cracks in fatigue, corrosion, and thermal damage than linear waves. Using the frequency information, the existence of a closed crack can be detected along a 1D wave path. However, the extraction of nonlinear waves in the time domain is rarely reported. In this study, nonlinear Lamb waves at a closed crack formed by a thermal pulse are extracted in the time domain. Combining with the sensor array technique, an image is reconstructed to show the location of the closed crack on a 2D plate. The recognized crack is 1 mm wide, 2 cm long, and 1 mm deep. The distance between the transmitter and the crack is set to 100, 150, and 200 mm to demonstrate the reliability of the proposed method.

"An adaptive sensor selection framework for multisensor prognostics Recent advances in sensor technology have made it possible to monitor the degradation of a system using multiple sensors simultaneously. Accordingly, many neural network-based prognostic models have been proposed to use observed multiple sensor signals as inputs and estimate the degradation status or failure time of the system. Although these models have achieved promising prognostic performance, it is still difficult to interpret the extracted features, and the models are often used in a black-box manner providing only the final results. In this study, a novel sensor selection framework is proposed to address this challenge by adaptively deciding which sensors to use at the moment to enhance remaining useful life prediction. The contributions of this work are summarized as follows: (1) being generic and can be attached to a variety of existing neural network-based prognostic models; (2) being trained in a unified manner to optimize both the sensor selection and prognostic accuracies simultaneously; (3) improving the interpretability of the model by explaining how different sensors contribute to the final remaining useful life prediction of individual systems over time; and (4) introducing several regularization techniques to ensure the stability of the training process.

"Physics-guided fault diagnosis method for proton exchange membrane fuel cells based on LSTM neural network In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid method for fault diagnosis of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs) based on the combination of a physics-based model and a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network. By incorporating the physics-based model in the fault diagnosis algorithm, we can access to several process variables not directly measured through sensors but related to the state of the PEMFC stack. The model estimates are subsequently combined with signals measured on the PEMFC stack and inputted to a LSTM neural network. The performance of the physics-guided LSTM is evaluated on an extensive dataset comprising a thousand hours of operation of a PEMFC stack under dynamic load profiles, proving the enhanced capability of the proposed fault diagnosis method in capturing complex fault patterns. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed method in dealing with PEMFC aging is tested by using data from the initial phase of stack operation for algorithm training and reserving the data from the aged stack operation for the testing phase.

"A Comparison of Machine Learning Methods for the Diagnosis of Motor Faults Using Automated Spectral Feature Extraction Technique Centrifugal pumps (CPs) are mainly composed of impeller and bearings. The operation of the CPs is disturbed if any of its components is faulty. Bearings faults are reported to be the major reason for pump failures. Condition monitoring of the CPs helps in early diagnosis and assists to keep machines in working condition with minimum maintenance costs. Famous non-intrusive techniques known as motor current analysis (MCA) have been reported in the literature for the detection of bearing anomalies. However, limited literature is available to diagnose the minor scratches in the bearing surface. Recent research on the diagnosis of bearing scratches identification through MCA has shown some promising results. The comparison of machine learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) was performed in the classification of healthy bearings and faulty bearings (holes and scratches). The fault classification accuracy of 89.26% was reported which is very low. The low amplitudes of the bearing scratch in the MCA spectrum, environment noise and utilization of conventional feature extraction techniques were the key reasons for the low accuracy. This problem has been tackled in this paper by developing an automated frequency features extraction algorithm (ASFEA) to extract useful feature from the integrated current and voltage sensors data. ASFEA operates based on the feature location identification in the spectrum, feature extraction, measuring the amplitude of the fault component and comparing it with the statistical threshold. The experimental data has been collected and the performance of the ASFEA has been tested on several machine learning techniques and the better classification accuracy of ASFEA (SVM 96.87%, k-NN 100%, NBC 96%, Gbdt 96.87%, CNN 100%) has been achieved as compared to previously reported methods. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2-s2.0-85127300078
"A modular adaptive residual generator for a diagnostic system that detects sensor faults on engine test beds It is a great challenge to apply a diagnostic system for sensor fault detection to engine test beds. The main problem is that such test beds involve frequent configuration changes or a change in the entire test engine. Therefore, the diagnostic system must be highly adaptable to different types of test engines. This paper presents a diagnostic method consisting of the following steps: residual generation, fault detection and fault isolation. As adaptability can be achieved with residual generation, the focus is on this step. The modular toolbox-based approach combines physics-based and data-driven modeling concepts and, thus, enables highly flexible application to various types of engine test beds.

"Bearing inner race fault detection and size estimation using the variable reluctance sensor The variable reluctance sensor (VRS) has been widely used in the speed measurement system in the fields of automobile, helicopter, and ship, because of its high robustness. In recent years, most studies have verified the effectiveness of the application in rotor torsional vibration measurement and blade monitoring by the VRS. However, there is less research devoted to the VRS in bearing fault diagnosis, and its influencing mechanism between bearing faults and signal characteristics is not clear. In this paper, the raw signal of the VRS is used for bearing diagnosis. The mechanism of bearing partial fault signal response is analyzed by establishing the bearing inner ring fault model and the sensor signal response model. The characteristics of the VRS signal are given and verified by experiments. The results show that the gearwheel tooth-pass frequency is modulated by the bearing fault characteristic frequency, and there is an obvious double peak phenomenon in the high-frequency part. Moreover, the fault data with widths of 1 mm and 2 mm are analyzed by using the interval time of double peak. It is found that the fault sizes estimated are close to the actual defect size, and have small standard deviations.

"A fault-injection-based approach to leak localization in water distribution networks using an ensemble model of Bayesian classifiers Leak localization in water distribution networks (WDNs) is essential to water management systems. Developing a reliable and robust leak localization technique is crucial for reducing water losses in large-scale WDNs. The challenge of leak localization in WDNs can be addressed using a model-based data-driven approach. Each node of a WDN is used as a category label by the classifier model for identifying leakages. As a result of the small number of sensors in a network and the uncertainties associated with the model parameters, the characteristics of some classes may be similar. Consequently, the algorithm's accuracy decreases. The method proposed in this paper uses the concept of fault injection and propagation in digital systems to separate the leak characteristics of the classes. This separation is done by creating a second leak with a known amount and location to propagate the effect of the first leak on the sensors. Various data sets are generated for each time sample by considering different values for the second leak. Finally, an ensemble of Bayesian classifiers simultaneously processes this data set to determine the leak's location. The accuracy of the proposed method has been evaluated using Hanoi and Modena network benchmarks. Experimental results show that the proposed method has 94.6% and 93.76 accuracy without using a time horizon technique, in the presence of all uncertainties for the Hanoi and Modena networks respectively which show more accurate results than existing methods‎. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85174801459

"H i /H ∞ -optimised fault detection for a surface vessel integrated navigation system Strapdown inertial navigation systems are widely used in surface ships and warships. Although high-precision optical fibre inertial navigation systems are available, they have high cost and limited practicality. Therefore, they cannot replace the traditional platform inertial navigation systems in all ships. Hence, microelectromechanical system (MEMS)-based inertial sensors are widely used for robust navigation. Accurate and timely identification of sensor faults while ensuring stable navigation is a challenging task. This paper proposes a robust fault detection (FD) approach for a low-cost system that loosely integrates a strapdown inertial navigation system and the global navigation satellite system, where the integrated navigation state estimation provides high-accuracy output.

"Application of Acoustic Signal Hybrid Filtering with 1D-CNN for Fault Diagnosis of Natural Gas Pipeline Leakage In acoustic signal-based natural gas pipeline leak detection, it is a technical difficulty to effectively remove the strong background noise hidden in the acoustic signal. Unfortunately, existing techniques usually study denoising in isolation from the model, and do not consider the synergistic effect of integrating denoising with the model to update filtering parameters adaptively, which limits the performance development of the diagnostic model. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a fault diagnosis method that incorporates acoustic signal hybrid filtering and a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) to jointly update the denoising parameters. Firstly, the acoustic signal is sampled at a fixed frequency by the sensor unit. Secondly, a hybrid filtering method with low-frequency characteristics is designed, which integrates low-pass filtering and median filtering to eliminate background noise. Finally, an adaptive fault diagnosis network that fuses acoustic signal denoising with 1D-CNN feature extraction is developed. The network updates the filtering parameters during training based on the model recognition accuracy, so that the denoising parameters and model weights change dynamically. The experimental results show that the method is capable of performing adaptive parameter search with 97.07% identification accuracy of fault type. © 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers.",2-s2.0-85195926615
"Interval estimation of sensor fault in rotary steerable drilling tools based on set-membership approach The rotary steerable drilling tools (RSDTs) are invented for high-precision wellpath control. Fault diagnosis is essential for the RSDT as it can improve the reliability of the drilling processes. To estimate the sensor fault of the RSDT, this paper investigates the interval estimation problem for Lipschitz nonlinear systems with sensor fault via the set-membership approach. Firstly, the RSDT is modeled by a discrete-time Lipschitz nonlinear system with unknown inputs, noises, and parameter uncertainties. Next, based on the ellipsoid bundles, a set-membership fault estimator is presented, where the unknown inputs are decoupled. Additionally, a sufficient condition, which is derived based on the P-radius of the ellipsoid bundles, is put forward to design the parameters of the estimator with Lipschitz nonlinear terms. Then, the interval estimations of the states and fault are obtained via ellipsoid bundles.

"Serial correlated–uncorrelated concurrent space method for process monitoring Due to the closed-loop feedback control system, the data collected in the industry process is always temporal serial correlated. Moreover, different types of sensor data (such as temperature, pressure, liquid level, flow and so on) would show different temporal serial correlations. Meanwhile, the current process monitoring method considers all types of sensor data equally, ignoring the difference in temporal serial correlations caused by various sensor types. In response to this, serial correlated–uncorrelated concurrent space method is proposed in this work, where process variable original space is divided into serial correlated space and serial uncorrelated space via the degree of temporal serial correlations. In addition, the proposed method not only considers the local monitoring within space via principal component analysis and slow feature analysis respectively, but also monitors the information between-space based on the moving window and the mutual information. Finally, on the basis of the monitoring statistic within space and between-space, the comprehensive monitoring indicator is constructed via the local outlier factor method.

"Mixed logical dynamical (MLD)-based Kalman filter for hybrid systems fault diagnosis The Mixed Logical Dynamical (MLD) model framework is used in this paper to develop a novel algorithm for state estimation and fault diagnosis in hybrid systems. These systems, with both continuous and discrete dynamics, present challenges for accurate state estimation and timely fault detection. The proposed method integrates the constrained Kalman filter, MLD modeling, and mixed integer programming for robust state monitoring and fault diagnosis. It leverages the MLD model to represent system dynamics while handling discrete and continuous states, offering a flexible framework for hybrid system analysis. The constrained Kalman filter estimates the system state in real time, ensuring the estimation stays within constraints that reflect physical or operational limits. This enhances robustness, especially in noisy environments. Mixed integer programming efficiently manages discrete events and logical decisions, capturing the hybrid system's nature. The technique, called the Hybrid Kalman Filter (HKF), combines Kalman filtering with MLD models to detect and isolate sensor faults. A bank of HKFs monitors specific sensors or subsystems for precise fault isolation. When a fault occurs, the corresponding HKF detects it, providing critical information about its location and nature.

"Sensor Data Recovery of Faulty LOX∕LH2 Rocket Engine Based on Multistage Graph Convolutional Network Engine, the indispensable core of a rocket, has a significant impact on space exploration, especially the high-thrust liquid-propellant rocket engine. Most new-generation manned rockets for space stations or lunar exploration prefer the LOX∕LH2 engine for its high performance and environmental friendliness. However, the LOX∕LH2 engine is susceptible to failure under extreme conditions, which could cause catastrophic consequences without timely warning. Real-time state detection and fault location can prevent some catastrophic outcomes, but they require reliable sensor data. Nevertheless, some sensor data could be lost due to signal interruptions or equipment shutdown caused by system faults. Therefore, recovering the lost data based on the remaining measurements is a critical challenge that involves dealing with the distribution gap between normal and faulty data. To tackle the data drift and achieve real-time and high-precision sensor data recovery of the faulty engine, a multistage model based on graph convolutional networks is proposed in this paper. Trained by a multiloss function, the model primarily recognizes the status of the engine and passes the status to the next stage. Then the second stage recovers the lost data by two graph convolutional networks specific to the normal or faulty state. Evaluated on the practical experimental data from Xi’an Aerospace Propulsion Institute, our method successfully identifies the state of the system with accuracy above 99.99% and recovers the incomplete sensor data with a mean absolute error under 0.0065.

"Experimental validation of passive and active fault-tolerant controls against sensor faults in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell system A fuel-cell system is interconnected with subsystems such as the stack, thermal/water management systems, air/fuel supply systems, and inverter; if an abnormality occurs, operational efficiency and availability of the entire system can decrease. However, when faults occur in the system, terminating system operations or replacing faulty parts every time can be expensive and inefficient. Instead, appropriate decision-making is required, with fault-tolerant control considered an appropriate solution. This study presents methods and criteria for fault-tolerant control when a fault occurs in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) system. By configuring a 1 kW residential PEMFC system, a fault occurring in either the thermocouple or mass flow meters – targets for the system control – is diagnosed, and real-time control change is performed instead of immediately repairing the sensor. This approach enables stable and continuous operation of the PEMFC system. The fault-tolerant control method consists of either the feed-back control method, using the real-time predicted value of each control sensor, or the feed-forward method, using the constant control-signal value learned in the normal state; the advantages and limitations of each method are compared. Futhermore, considering the system efficiency, stack durability, and operating control deterioration, a guideline is suggested for applying fault-tolerant control and improving its corresponding effectiveness. For example, fault-tolerant control can resolve a 4.6% decrease in system efficiency caused by a thermocouple fault. This study contributes to improving the system operation rate and reliability by applying fault-tolerant control, thus facilitating efficient decision-making following fault diagnosis. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85168837584
"Fault detection and tolerant control for flying-capacitor modular multilevel converters feeding induction motor drives In this paper, an IGBT open-circuit fault detection and fault-tolerant control strategy are proposed for a flying-capacitor modular multilevel converter (FC-MMC) feeding induction motor drives. Fault occurrence is detected by monitoring the sum of measured AC-circulating currents. In the fault case, the phase with the faulty device is identified through the errors between the measured and estimated output currents of the converter. In this phase, then, a localization of a faulty submodule (SM) is performed by investigating the SM capacitor voltages. Thereafter, the fault-tolerant control method is applied to reconfigure the converter structure, where the faulty SM is isolated and the converter can operate as normal. In addition, an SM capacitor voltage-balancing control scheme is proposed, where the number of current sensors is reduced to six from nine. Therefore, the system cost is lowered, and the communication burden is lightened. The viability of the proposed control scheme is confirmed by experimental results for an FC-MMC-fed induction motor drive system. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to The Korean Institute of Power Electronics.",2-s2.0-85128390737
"LSTM based artificial intelligence predictive maintenance technique for availability rate and OEE improvement in a TPM implementing plant through Industry 4.0 transformation Purpose: The artificial intelligence (AI) based total productive maintenance (TPM) condition based maintenance (CBM) approach through Industry 4.0 transformation can well predict the breakdown in advance to eliminate breakdown. Design/methodology/approach: Meeting the customer requirement as per the delivery schedule with the existing resources are always a big challenge in industries. Any catastrophic breakdown in the equipment leads to increase in production loss, damage to machines, repair cost, time and affects delivery. If these breakdowns are predicted in advance, the breakdown can be addressed before its occurrence and the demand supply chain can be met. TPM is one of the essential operational excellence tool used in industries to utilize the existing resources of a plant in a optimal way. The conventional time based maintenance (TBM) and CBM approach of TPM in Industry 3.0 is time consuming and not accurate enough to achieve zero down time. Findings: The proposed AI and IIoT based TPM is achieved in a digitalized data oriented platform to monitor and control the health status of the machine which may reduce the catastrophic breakdown by 95% and also improves the quality rate and machine performance rate. Based on the identified key signature parameters related to major breakdown are measured using the sensors, digitalised by programmable logic controller (PLC) and monitored by supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and predicted in server or cloud. Originality/value: Long short term memory based deep learning network was developed as a regression forecasting model to predict the remaining useful life RUL of the part or assembly and based on the predictions, corrective action has been implemented before the occurrence of breakdown. The reliability and consistency of the proposed approach are validated and horizontally deployed in similar machines to achieve zero downtime. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2-s2.0-85150606794
"Natural Gas Transfer Pump Fault Diagnosis on Multi-Sensor Fusion and Machine Learning Machine learning (ML) techniques have great engineering value in the field of natural gas transfer pump fault diagnosis. However, the traditional spectral analysis method is difficult to extract the characteristic components of the fault in transmission pump fault diagnosis. In addition, the existing fault diagnosis methods cannot accurately distinguish what fault mode the fault component belongs to. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes a natural gas transfer pump fault diagnosis method based on multi-sensor fusion and machine learning. Firstly, the vibration signals of the natural gas transfer pump are collected by multiple acceleration sensors, and the original data are processed by Complementary Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (CEEMD) to obtain multiple vibration fault characteristic IMF components. Then, the IMF components are denoised by Tunable Q-factor Wavelet Transform (TQWT). As an improved method of wavelet transform, TQWT can obtain data that can express all the features of the original data with less noise by adjusting the Q-factor. Finally, the local and global kernel functions are linearly summed using weights to form a multi-core support vector machine to identify vibration fault features. The experimental results show that the combination of CEEMD and TQWT can effectively eliminate modal aliasing and obtain IMF components that clearly characterise fault features. Meanwhile, the fault diagnosis accuracy of the multicore support vector machine is improved from 77.5% to 87.6% compared with the existing methods. © 2024, J. Network Intell.

"A multi-rate sampling data fusion method for fault diagnosis and its industrial applications The multi-sensor data fusion based data-driven fault diagnosis method is a promising approach to detect faults of complex systems. However, in the actual industrial environment, the sampling rate of different sensors is often inconsistent. In order to apply this kind of data to fault diagnosis, the traditional methods are to preprocess it and convert it into single sampling rate data. However, these methods are all machine learning methods, which rely on manual feature extraction. To the best of our knowledge, few works have used deep learning (DL) methods to solve this problem. To fill this gap, a novel multi-rate sampling data fusion method for fault diagnosis is proposed in this paper. In the proposed method, signals with different sampling rates are fused. First, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is adopted to learn features from raw data automatically. Then, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network is utilized to mine the time correlation in extracted features and encode the temporal information. The methodology is validated on a public experimental dataset and data from a real industrial scenario. The proposed method is compared with some state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) and DL methods, the results show that the proposed method can distinguish different conditions satisfactorily and has the best diagnostic accuracy among all comparison methods. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85108286106
"Human-Centric IoT-Driven Digital Twins in Predictive Maintenance for Optimizing Industry 5.0 Predictive maintenance now heavily relies on digital twins and the Internet of Things (IoT), allowing industrial assets to be monitored and make real-time decisions. However, adding human components to conventional optimization processes creates new difficulties as Industry 5.0 moves toward human-centric systems. Existing frameworks frequently disregard human preferences, intuition, and safety considerations, which makes human operators distrustful and unwilling to accept them. This paper presents a novel multi-objective optimization framework to enable predictive maintenance that incorporates human feedback into IoT-driven digital twins. The framework uses an enhanced particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to reconcile competing goals, including maintaining operator safety, optimizing asset reliability, and minimizing maintenance costs. Furthermore, maintenance tasks are adaptively scheduled using built-in reinforcement learning (RL), and optimized model parameters are fine-tuned to improve predictive accuracy using Bayesian optimization. The latter is based on real-time operational data. In addition to promoting a safer working environment, the suggested approach significantly reduces unplanned downtime and maintenance costs. This research contributes to developing more resilient, adaptive, and collaborative industrial systems by aligning with the human-centric principles of Industry 5.0. The proposed model was tested using the maintenance duration and improved 10 to 100 hours. The model was compared with the PSO algorithm, demonstrating its superiority with a 7.5% reduction in total maintenance cost and a 6.3% decrease in total downtime. These improvements enhance operational efficiency and better human-machine collaboration by minimizing unnecessary interventions and optimizing resource allocation. © 2025, Izmir Academy Association.

"CNN-based fault classification considered fault location of vibration signals Recently, with the development of the 4th industrial technology such as big data, cloud computing, and IoT, technologies that automatically perform specific tasks without human intervention are being applied in many industrial sites. In the case of rotating equipment diagnosis, features are extracted based on the shape and statistical information of the time and frequency signals of the vibration data for each location, and the acquired data is classified as normal or defective by learning it. However, since this method used the shape and statistical information of the vibration signals, the physical meaning is blurred and the information is not meaningful for actual diagnosis, resulting in inconsistent learning models even in the same facility. In this study, the possibility of classifying normal and fault condition were confirmed by generating images considering the fault component and sensor location of the vibration signal and applying to CNN-based deep learning technology. As a method of performing image processing, STFT is performed on the acquired vibration signal data for each position to generate an image. In addition, converting each sensor position attached to red, green, and blue to express location information, resynthesis was performed to configure learning data and create a classification model. In order to verify this method, verification was performed based on the data acquired for the gearbox system to confirm the possibility of classifying the fault condition. © 2023, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2-s2.0-85173742673
"Data-driven multi-fault detection in pipelines utilizing frequency response function and artificial neural networks This research presents a data-driven structural health monitoring (SHM) approach for pipeline systems that leverages frequency response function (FRF) signals and artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms to accurately identify and classify diverse pipeline fault conditions. The study focuses on three specific faults: bolt looseness, scale deposits, and crack occurrence at pipeline supports, which were replicated on a pipeline segment located at the Sound and Vibration Research Group (SVRG) at University Putra Malaysia (UPM). The FRF signals were captured using accelerometers to monitor the structural health of the pipeline. The data acquisition stage involved collecting FRF signals from the accelerometers to capture vibrations and responses related to the identified faults using a Siemens LMS SCADAS data acquisition unit. The data underwent preprocessing, including the application of principal component analysis (PCA) for feature selection. The subsequent data processing stage involved the application of an ANN algorithm for pattern recognition to analyze and classify the acquired data, identifying patterns associated with the replicated fault conditions. The proposed methodology demonstrated exceptional performance, with the ANN model achieving consistently high overall accuracy (above 99.7%) and remarkably low mean squared error (in the range of 0.0088 × 10−3 to 0.3062 × 10−3) across multiple iterations and sensor datasets. The detailed class-specific metrics, including accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and F1-score, further substantiated the model's effectiveness in identifying the individual fault types with near-perfect or perfect results for the majority of the fault scenarios. The location-invariant performance of the ANN model across different sensor placements demonstrates the robustness of the proposed data-driven SHM methodology. This research highlights the transformative potential of integrating state-of-the-art data-driven techniques to revolutionize the monitoring and assessment of critical pipeline infrastructure, ultimately enhancing the safety, reliability, and longevity of these vital systems. © 2024",2-s2.0-85214935667
"Structural Health Monitoring of Electromechanical Actuators in Aviation—Challenges Ahead and Case Study Electrical actuation concept fits perfectly with the worldwide strategy of more electric aircraft to reduce carbon footprint. However, the integration of linear electro-mechanical actuators is promising yet challenging in safety critical systems due to the jamming of the driven load. That fault is a critical mechanical transmission failure giving rise to concern in many applications such as primary flight controls or landing gears extension and steering. This article critically reviews electric actuation solutions currently available for aerospace application, the limits for their upcoming deployment and the different solutions to achieve an on-condition maintenance to reduce any safety risk during lifetime. A particular attention is given to the jamming and possible strategies to avoid any hazard induced by this failure. The most promising approach relies on the establishment of a predictive maintenance by monitoring continuously the actuator to timely warn any structural alteration, which is prone to induce jamming. Finally, a case study is presented, showing the ability of engine current monitoring to warn any alteration in the load maneuvering. The current spectrum analysis is found to be sensitive to both mechanical fault and control failure or malfunctioning. On top of that, no addition sensors are needed, making this technique affordable and cost-effective. Copyright © 2022 by ASME.",2-s2.0-85139990439
"Prognostics and Predictive Maintenance Optimization Based on Combination BP-RBF-GRNN Neural Network Model and Proportional Hazard Model Owning to the advantage of keeping the operating environment safe, high reliability, and low production cost, predictive maintenance has been widely used in industry and academia. Predictive maintenance based on degeneration state mainly studies the degeneration prediction. However, on account of the error of the sensor and human, condition monitoring data may not directly reflect the true degeneration. The degeneration model with dynamic explanatory covariates which is named as proportional hazard model is proposed to deal with the semi-observed monitoring condition. And the degeneration prediction mainly adopts a single prediction model, which leads to low prediction accuracy. A combination forecasting model can effectively solve the above problem. Compared to the traditional prediction method, the neural network model can use the ""black box""characteristic to indirectly construct the degeneration model without complex mathematical derivation. Therefore, we propose a combination BP-RBF-GRNN neural network model which is applied to improve the degeneration prediction with dynamic covariate. Based on the above two aspects, a predictive maintenance optimization framework based on the proportional hazard model and BP-RBF-GRNN neural network model is proposed to improve maintenance efficiency and reduce maintenance costs. The simulation results of thrust ball bearing show that the proposed method can effectively improve the degeneration prediction accuracy and reduce the maintenance cost rate to a certain extent.  © 2022 Guoqiang Tong et al.",2-s2.0-85129992976
"Air leaks fault detection in maintenance using machine learning Purpose: The objective of this paper is to develop a condition-based maintenance (CBM) scheme for pneumatic cylinders. The CBM scheme will detect two common types of air leaking failure modes and identify the leaky/faulty cylinder. The successful implementation of the proposed scheme will reduce energy consumption, scrap and rework, and time to repair. Design/methodology/approach: Effective implementation of maintenance is important to reduce operation cost, improve productivity and enhance quality performance at the same time. Condition-based monitoring is an effective maintenance scheme where maintenance is triggered based on the condition of the equipment monitored either real time or at certain intervals. Pneumatic air systems are commonly used in many industries for packaging, sorting and powering air tools among others. A common failure mode of pneumatic cylinders is air leaks which is difficult to detect for complex systems with many connections. The proposed method consists of monitoring the stroke speed profile of the piston inside the pneumatic cylinder using hall effect sensors. Statistical features are extracted from the speed profiles and used to develop a fault detection machine learning model. The proposed method is demonstrated using a real-life case of tea packaging machines. Findings: Based on the limited data collected, the ensemble machine learning algorithm resulted in 88.4% accuracy. The algorithm can detect failures as soon as they occur based on majority vote rule of three machine learning models. Practical implications: Early air leak detection will improve quality of packaged tea bags and provide annual savings due to time to repair and energy waste reduction. The average annual estimated savings due to the implementation of the new CBM method is $229,200 with a payback period of less than two years. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is the first in terms of proposing a CBM for pneumatic systems air leaks using piston speed. Majority, if not all, current detection methods rely on expensive equipment such as infrared or ultrasonic sensors. This paper also contributes to the research gap of economic justification of using CBM. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2-s2.0-85191826376
"Directional fault classification for correlated High-Dimensional data streams using hidden Markov models Modern manufacturing systems are often installed with sensor networks which generate high-dimensional data at high velocity. These data streams offer valuable information about the industrial system’s real-time performance. If a shift occurs in the manufacturing process, fault diagnosis based on the data streams becomes a fundamental task as it identifies the affected data streams and provides insights into the root cause. Existing fault diagnostic methods either ignore the correlation between different streams or fail to determine the shift directions. In this paper, we propose a directional fault classification procedure that incorporates the between-stream correlations. We suggest a three-state hidden Markov model that captures the correlation structure and enables inference about the shift direction. We show that our procedure is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the expected number of false discoveries while controlling the proportion of missed signals at a desired level. We also propose a deconvolution-expectation-maximization (DEM) algorithm for estimating the model parameters and establish the asymptotic optimality for the data-driven version of our procedure. Numerical comparisons with an existing approach and an application to a semiconductor production study show that the proposed procedure works well in practice. © 2023 American Society for Quality.",2-s2.0-85162665937

"Fault detection based on parity equations in multiple lane road car-following models using bayesian lane change estimation One of the current topics of interest in transportation science is the use of intelligent computation and IoT (Internet of Things) technologies. Researchers have proposed many approaches using these concepts, but the most widely used concept in road traffic modeling at the microscopic level is the car-following model. Knowing that the standard car-following model is single lane-oriented, the purpose of this paper is to present a fault detection analysis of the extension to a multiple lane car-following model that uses the Bayesian reasoning concept to estimate lane change behavior. After the application of the latter model on real traffic data retrieved from inductive loops placed on a road network, fault detection using parity equations was used. The standard car-following model applied separately for each lane showed the ability to perform a lane change action and to incorporate a new vehicle into the current lane. The results will highlight the advantages and the critical points of influence in the use of a multiple lane car-following model based on probabilistic estimated lane changes. Additionally, this research applied fault detection based on parity equations for the proposed model. The purpose was to deliver an overview of the faults introduced by the behavior of vehicles in adjacent lanes on the behavior of the target vehicle. © 2020 by the authors.

"Anomaly detection in Li-ion cells using physics-based reduced-order thermal models Urban Air Mobility and electric aviation present significant battery performance and safety challenges, particularly due to the weight penalties resulting from thermal runaway containment strategies. NASA's SPARRCI project seeks to tackle these challenges through a catastrophic failure avoidance approach using enhanced battery monitoring and maintenance to detect performance anomalies that can help provide early warnings of potential faults and failures. This study explores a combination of thermal reduce order models (TROM), presented in Khasin et al. (2024), and anomaly detection (AD) algorithms to identify deviation in performance that can serve as a tool for predictive battery maintenance. TROM and AD algorithms were applied to various electric aviation flight profiles (UAS, eVTOL, and NASA's X-57). The results show that TROM parameters are identifiable for the thermal dataset generated by cycling nine commercial cells from three chemistries (Gr-LCO, SiGr-NMC811, and Gr-NCA) to their end-of-life. The summary statistics of cell temperature were neither sensitive nor accurate in detecting cooling faults or sensor errors. However, TROM was able to identify cooling system faults and current sensor errors from anomalies in the thermal model parameters. Further investigation is needed to assess the severity of each anomaly and its potential to become catastrophic faults. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",2-s2.0-85215839158
"Hybrid Niche Immune Genetic Algorithm for Fault Detection Coverage in Industry Wireless Sensor Network The industry wireless sensor network (IWSN) technology, which is used to monitor industrial equipment, has attracted more and more attention in recent years. Sensor nodes in IWSN can spontaneously complete distributed networking and carry out monitoring tasks under random deployment conditions. Therefore, a self-organized IWSN is particularly suitable for the fault detection and diagnosis of industrial equipment in complex environments. However, due to the detection, ability of a single sensor node is limited, and the monitoring distribution problem is a typical multidimensional discrete NP-hard combinatorial stochastic optimization problem, which is challenging to solve for the traditional mathematical methods. With the purpose of improving the target monitoring capability and prolonging lifetime of IWSN, a novel hybrid niche immune genetic algorithm (HNIGA) for optimizing the target coverage model of fault detection is proposed. It uses the genetic operation to evolve antibody groups and applies niche technology to maintain the diversity of antibody groups. As a result, HNIGA can effectively reduce the failure rate of detection targets. To verify the performance of HNIGA, a series of simulations under different simulation conditions are carried out. Specifically, HNIGA is compared with genetic algorithm (GA) and simulated annealing (SA). Simulation results show that HNIGA has a faster convergence speed and more robust global search capability than the other two algorithms. © 2021 Jie Zhou et al.",2-s2.0-85108962679
"Visual analytics for process monitoring: Leveraging time-series imaging for enhanced interpretability In the era of big data driven by the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), process industries face the challenge of analyzing massive and complex data to extract relevant information for effective process monitoring. Despite exploring various approaches, scalability and interpretability continue to present practical limitations. To address these limitations, we propose a new framework called visual analytics. Visual analytics offers a new perspective on solving process monitoring problems. It involves transforming historical process data into visual clues, thereby converting traditional fault detection problems into image classification problems. This approach allows process experts to visually analyze patterns and textures within the data, making interpretation much easier compared to traditional time domain analysis. Moreover, by treating process data as images, visual analytics can leverage a wide range of computer vision techniques, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to accurately classify and detect faults. By integrating human visual perception with advanced computer vision techniques, visual analytics enables the effective analysis of massive and complex process data. To empirically validate the proposed visual analytics approach, we conduct experiments on both the simulated continuous stirred tank heater (CSTH) benchmark and the industrial arc loss benchmark. The experimental results from both benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed visual analytics approach yields competitive performance in predicting process faults while enhancing interpretability by providing meaningful and informative visual representations. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85179726017
"Prediction of remaining useful life of metro traction motor bearings based on DCCNN-GRU and multi-information fusion A single type of sensor is susceptible to interference and limited degradation information can be extracted. Therefore, a multi-information fusion-based bearing remaining useful life prediction method using the dual-channel convolutional neural network (DCCNN) and the gated recurrent unit (GRU) is proposed. Firstly, vibration sensors are utilized as a basis for signal collection, while acoustic emission sensors are introduced as a complement to obtain more comprehensive degradation information. Secondly, the time domain, frequency domain and time-frequency domain features of the vibration signal and acoustic emission signal were extracted respectively to construct a comprehensive bearing degradation feature set. Third, multiple evaluation indicators are used to comprehensively evaluate the degradation features, and effective degradation features that are highly related to bearing degradation are selected for feature fusion. Subsequently, the DCCNN-GRU model was established, which captures and comprehensively utilizes different degradation feature information in each channel through the DCCNN network structure, and employs GRU to process the time relationships and dependencies in sequence data to solves the vanishing gradient problem.

"Fault diagnosis method of belt conveyor idler based on sound signal Damage to a belt conveyor idler will increase the downtime and maintenance cost, so it is very important to diagnose its fault. At present, the fault diagnosis of the idler of a belt conveyor is mostly based on vibration and temperature signal. However, contact fault diagnosis approaches are severely limited when sensors are inconvenient to install or when vibration and temperature signals cannot be returned. In this special case, the non-contact fault diagnosis method, represented by measuring acoustic signals, becomes a necessary means. To effectively extract mechanical state information from sound signals of belt conveyors and identify typical mechanical faults, we propose a fault detection method based on sample center distance weighted (support vector data description (SVDD)) and multi-frame fusion (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC)) features. Aiming at the disadvantage that single frame MFCC features and traditional SVDD are susceptible to noise, multi-frame fusion MFCC optimization features are used as samples, and the weighted SVDD model based on sample center distance is used for fault detection. Finally, the overall recognition accuracy of the experiment is greatly improved. It is proved that MFCC features of multi-frame fusion sound signal and weighted SVDD fault detection based on sample center distance can effectively determine whether there is a fault in the of belt conveyor idler. © 2023, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2-s2.0-85145208278
"A carrier wave extraction method for cavitation characterization based on time synchronous average and time-frequency analysis Cavitation detection is important in ensuring the reliability of fluid machinery, such as pumps. Vibration signal analysis is widely accepted as an effective tool in condition monitoring and fault diagnosis due to its ability to obtain substantial information and convenience of sensor arrangement. However, cavitation characterization based on vibration measurement is challenging because of the complicated underlying mechanism and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of actual data. This study proposes a carrier wave extraction method for cavitation characterization by combining time synchronous average and time-frequency analysis (TATF) based on amplitude-modulated (AM) signal theory. The proposed method can reasonably measure cavitation severity by distinguishing time-frequency characteristics between different cavitation states. Compared with traditional vibration/acoustic signal monitoring or intelligent diagnostic techniques, cavitation detection based on TATF has the advantages of accurate classification and outstanding physical significance. First, cavitation state division criterion based on energy indicator is proposed. Its superiority is verified via comparison with the traditional criterion of hydraulic head. Second, the vibration signal model of pumps is established as an AM signal model, and the modulation mechanism is elaborated. Extraction of carrier wave components caused by cavitation is regarded as the critical issue in cavitation characterization. Then, TATF is described detailedly and its effectiveness is validated by simulation signals and actual data. Finally, the intelligent classification results of cavitation state by deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) demonstrate the superiority of TATF over short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and wavelet transform (WT). © 2020",2-s2.0-85090570087
"Vibration based modelling of acoustic emission of rolling element bearings Vibration response has been extensively used for fault diagnosis, condition monitoring and root cause analysis of issues in the smooth operation of mechanical systems. In recent years, acoustic emission (AE) measurement and analysis have found significant applications in the field of in-situ as well as off-site fault diagnosis and condition monitoring of machines. To monitor vibration or AE of system, sensors are placed close to rolling element bearing (REB), but in fact, REBs themselves are sometimes the source of the problem in the machinery. As such, in all the dynamic mechanical systems, REBs are one of the most critical components, in regards to their usefulness as well as failure. This has led to extensive analytical and experimental research on REBs. To study the dynamic features and inherent characteristics of REBs, many researchers have formulated multi-body dynamic models of REBs. The results of these models have been well supported by experimental evidence. Contrary to this, very few attempts can be located in literature, which aim at modelling of acoustic emission of REBs and hence this paper is tasked with the same. A novel approach for AE modelling is used in this paper, and the proposed model is a blend of multi-body dynamic model and asperity based acoustic emission model of REB. The dynamic model of REB is solved to compute the contact deformations and thus contact forces. From these contact forces and lubricant film thickness; asperity forces and their deformations are computed and then fused into the AE model to compute the root mean square (rms) value of resultant AE signal. The developed model is deployed for analyzing the effect of load, speed, and radial clearance on AE. The results show that AE increases as load increases, it increases as speed increases up to a certain value and then decreases, and finally, as clearance increases, the AE decreases. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85082811234
"Modal coupling analysis of the acoustic wave scattering from blockage in a pipe Acoustic sensing system deployed on an autonomous platform (also referred to as robot) for accurate condition monitoring and fault detection in pipes requires the knowledge of wave scattering from various in-pipe faults or the robot itself. Existing solutions to estimate wave scattering tend to either be constrained to the plane wave regime or be computationally expensive outside this range. There has been a lack of work to apply analytical modal coupling methods to study wave scattering from a non-symmetric cross-sectional change in a pipe beyond the plane wave regime. This paper proposes an efficient three-dimensional (3D) modal coupling method to predict wave scattering from a cross-sectional change in a pipe in the frequency range beyond the plane wave regime. The trapped modes induced by a 3D axisymmetric or non-axisymmetric cross-sectional change in an air-filled pipe are estimated using modal coupling analysis. The derived analytical model is validated against numerical simulations and measurements. It agrees with a finite element simulation with Comsol Multiphysics in the 0.01<kR<4 frequency range (k being the wavenumber and R being the pipe radius) within 15 %, but it is approximately 600 times faster than the Comsol simulation making it attractive for the deployment on sensors with limited computer power that can be used for autonomous inspection of buried pipes. © 2024 The Author(s)",2-s2.0-85194077110
"Intelligent state estimation for fault tolerant integrated frequent RTO and adaptive nonlinear MPC Combinations of real-time optimization (RTO) and model predictive control (MPC) have been widely employed in the process industry for tracking the economic optimum in the face of drifting disturbances and parameters. Online update of model parameters is a critical step in the implementation of RTO. In this work, an intelligent state and parameter estimation approach is developed by combining a fault diagnosis approach with a simultaneous state and parameter estimator. Since faults are more likely to develop as slow drifts, a nonlinear generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) approach available in the literature is modified by considering ramp models for the progression of faults with time. When a fault is isolated by the fault diagnosis and identification (FDI) component, the magnitude of the isolated fault is refined using a moving window state and parameter estimator until the fault magnitude continues to change. The estimation of fault magnitudes is carried out only when required and triggered by the fault identification scheme. Thus, the subset of parameters/faults that are being estimated online can change with time. The intelligent state and parameter estimator is further combined with an online optimizing control scheme consisting of integrated frequent RTO and adaptive MPC. The integrated optimizing control scheme has embedded intelligence to auto-correct models used for estimation, control, and optimization and decide whether the detected changes require the invocation of RTO. The proposed approach employs a single model to carry out four different tasks: process monitoring, state and parameter estimation, nonlinear predictive control, and real-time optimization. This eliminates difficulties that can arise due to model mismatch between different components of the online optimizing control scheme. The efficacy of the proposed scheme is investigated using the benchmark Williams Otto reactor and a continuously operated fermenter. The economic optimum operating point of these systems is sensitive to mean shifts in unmeasured disturbances or system parameters. The proposed ramp model based approach successfully isolates the parameter/ unmeasured disturbance/ sensor bias/ actuator bias that has undergone slow drift and tracks the shifting economic optimum without significant delays. Thus, the proposed integrated approach has the ability to handle normal and abnormal operating envelopes of the system. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85173613632
"Data Anomaly Detection for Bridge SHM Based on CNN Combined with Statistic Features Structural health monitoring of long-span bridge has received increasing attention in recent years. In order to achieve accurate monitoring, the integrity of data collection should be guaranteed. Unfortunately, these data inevitably contain a variety of types of anomalies due to sensor faults, harsh environments, and other issues. Identifying anomalies from the data is essential to ensure credible monitoring results. Machine learning methods have the potential to detect data anomaly automatically. However, a well-performed convolutional neural network (CNN) model requires a large number of balanced training samples and frequent tuning. When similar anomalous patterns exist in complex systems, the tuning process might be time-consuming. In this paper, a data anomaly detection method is proposed based on CNN combined with statistic features. Firstly, acceleration data are downsampled, stacked, and input into CNN as the training set. A CNN model is designed and trained. Intermediate results are obtained through the model. Subsequently, the statistic features are applied to analyze and classify the confusable patterns. The novelty of this framework is that it combines the advantages of CNN and statistical features, which can realize data anomaly detection faster and more accurately than using CNN alone. The results of the acceleration data from a bridge demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach to identify the anomalous data. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2-s2.0-85126386019
"Comparative Assessment and Experimental Validation of a Prototype Phase-Optical Time-Domain Reflectometer for Distributed Structural Health Monitoring Dynamic characterization and Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) are crucial tools, of increasing demand, for reliable operation and predictive maintenance of large infrastructures, as the percentage of critically ageing infrastructures is growing steadily. We present a minimally invasive and synchronous fiber optic monitoring system for SHM, based on Phase-Optical Time-Domain Reflectometry (Phase-OTDR), and we assess its applicability and performance on a modular Bailey-type bridge of 1: 2.5 scale. Phase-OTDR systems, along with other fiberoptic-distributed techniques have proven their capabilities in long-range SHM applications, although their complexity and high cost limits drastically their applicability and SHM market penetration. Here, we propose the use of a prototype Phase-OTDR system, featuring customized interrogation instrumentation with a balanced trade-off between performance and cost.

"Vibration Response-Based Intelligent Non-Contact Fault Diagnosis of Bearings Accelerometers, used as vibration pickups in machine health monitoring systems, need physical connection to the machine tool through cables, complicating physical systems. A non-contact laser based vibration sensor has been developed and used for bearing health monitoring in this article. The vibration data have been acquired under speed and load variation. Hilbert transform (HT) has been applied for denoising the vibration signal. An extraction of condition monitoring indicators from both raw and envelope signals has been made, and the dimensionality of these extracted indicators was deducted with principal component analysis (PCA). Sequential floating forward selection (SFFS) method has been implemented for ranking the selected indicators in order of significance for reduction in the input vector size and for finalizing the most optimal indicator set. Finally, the selected indicators are passed to k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and weighted kNN (WkNN) for diagnosing the bearing defects. The comparative analysis of the effectiveness of kNN and WkNN has been executed. It is evident from the experimental results that the vibration signals obtained from developed non-contact sensor compare adequately with the accelerometer data obtained under similar conditions. The performance of WkNN has been found to be slower compared to kNN. The proposed fault detection methodology compares very well with the other reported methods in the literature. The non-contact fault detection methodology has an enormous potential for automatic recognition of defects in the machine, which can provide early signals to avoid catastrophic failure and unplanned equipment shutdowns. © 2021 by ASME.",2-s2.0-85100024553
"On the design of an unknown input observer to fault detection, isolation, and estimation for uncertain multi-delay nonlinear systems In this article, an unknown input observer (UIO) is proposed for fault detection and isolation (FDI) for uncertain nonlinear time-delay systems with multiple discrete delays. The presented UIO can be able to isolate both actuator and sensor faults and estimate them to identify the shape, time of occurrence, amplitude, and other features of the faults. Furthermore, the proposed FDI method is robust to both input/state and output disturbances. At first, the system dynamics and faults are augmented and then UIO is driven. A delay-independent Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional is utilized to guarantee the stability of the proposed UIO-based FDI method. The terms of stability and UIO gains are obtained by solving some feasible linear matrix inequalities (LMI). The proposed method is simulated on two interconnected well-mixed non-isothermal continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) with recycling where there are three parallel, irreversible elemental exothermic reactions. Two point-wise time delays in the output temperature and concentration in both CSTRs are considered. Furthermore, parametric uncertainties in the modeling are investigated. The simulation and numerical results show the superiority of the proposed UIO for fault detection, isolation, and estimation in the presence of multiple discrete time delays, model uncertainty, and input/state and output disturbances. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85163169769
"Design of functional observers for fault detection and isolation in nonlinear systems in the presence of noises This work deals with the problem of designing functional observers for fault diagnosis in nonlinear systems in the presence of noises. It follows up previous work of the authors on design of functional observers (residual generators) for deterministic systems from the point of view of observer error linearization. Here, we consider the effect of noises on residual generation. The effect of sensor noises on the residuals is studied analytically and the associated probability distributions are derived. Following this, a well-known statistical hypothesis testing approach, Generalized Likelihood Ratio, is used to track changes in the mean of the residual to enable robust fault detection. The approach is also extended to process noises (plant-model mismatch) numerically. Throughout the study the methods presented are tested on a non-isothermal CSTR case study. The results show that the fault diagnosis scheme is able to quickly and accurately detect faults in the presence of both sensor and process noises. © 2021",2-s2.0-85119594959
"Optimal test and sensor selection for active fault diagnosis using integer programming A model-based method is presented for the simultaneous selection of tests and sensors in fault detection and isolation (FDI) of systems subject to uncertainty. Tests and sensors are selected out of a continuous or discrete set of options based on their contribution to information gain with respect to fault identifiability. The objective of the optimization of the tests designed is to maximize the sensitivity of sensed outputs with respect to faults and minimize the joint confidence between faults and sources of uncertainty. The methodology is intended for active FDI in systems that can be limited to a finite number of input design scenarios, with a set of sensors that may or may not be valuable for the purpose of fault detection. The optimization of discrete sensors and input designs is formulated as a constrained mixed integer non-linear program that maximizes a measure of Fisher information, which calculates output sensitivities with respect to faults and uncertainty, by treating those as parameters in the system model. Kullback–Leibler divergence is used to determine the isolation capacity of a FDI test when there is uncertainty in inputs and parameters. FDI tests are executed using k-nearest neighbor classification, which is used as a verification method for test designs and sensor networks that result in high correct classification rates. The proposed design framework is tested on a virtual benchmark three-tank system, subject to multiple faults and sources of uncertainty. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85087217437
"A multi-domain diagnostic framework for CRD fuel injection systems under water-in-diesel emulsion fuel conditions From a global perspective, combustion emission from diesel engines has negatively impacted our environment as observed from the increasing global warming and other environmental pollution. In the quest for mitigating these consequences, diesel emulsification offers a cost-efficient and eco-friendly alternative but the corrosion, wear, and power loss effects on the engine pose a strong concern for global adoption. In the right proportions and mixing conditions, water-in-diesel (WiD) emulsion fuels can offer long-term solutions to reducing the number of combustion residuals-nitrogen oxides (Nox), particulate matter (PM), carbon oxides (COx) and with appropriate condition monitoring techniques in place, engine efficiency can be maintained. Interestingly, the rail pressure sensor (RPS) of a common rail (CR) diesel engine reflects the underlying transient and spectral dynamics in the CR system at varying engine speeds and WiD emulsion compositions and when properly harnessed can be used for condition monitoring/diagnosis. This paper proposes a machine learning (ML)-based diagnostic framework for CR diesel engines that functions on the use of continuous wavelet coefficients (CWCs) and short-time Fourier transform (STFT) outputs from the first-order derivatives of the RPS signals. Following an investigative experiment on a KIA Sorento 2004 four-cylinder line engine at various WiD emulsion compositions at various engine RPMs, diagnostic results show that exploring a multi-domain approach of feature extraction offers more discriminative diagnostic parameters thereby providing a wider perspective to condition monitoring and with the robustness of ML classifiers, accurate diagnostics can be achieved. A comparative assessment using global and local evaluation tools reveal the diagnostic performances of the ML algorithms and the trustworthiness of the most accurate model- random forest (RF) with a test accuracy of 96.65 % following a grid search against the other widely-used ML-based diagnostic tools. © 2022, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2-s2.0-85124102078
"SF6 decomposed gas sensing performance of van der Waals layered cobalt oxyhydroxide: insights from a computational study The detection of SF6 decomposition products plays a significant part in identifying and assessing the electric discharge faults in SF6 insulation equipment. We performed dispersion corrected density functional theory calculations to study the adsorption performance of CoOOH upon SO2, SF4, SOF2, CF4, and SO2F2 toxic gases, to investigate their potential application as a gas sensor. The results clearly show a weak force between the CoOOH sheet, and the molecular gas with moderate adsorption strength enhances the desorption processes. According to Löwdin charge population analysis, electrons transfer from the molecular gas to the CoOOH surface, where the molecular gas behaves like an electron donor. The lower bandgap energy of the adsorption systems compared with pristine CoOOH significantly increases its electrical conductivity and gas sensing performance. The higher charge transfer and adsorption energy of the SOF2 adsorption system compared with the other four molecular gas is due to orbital hybridization around the Fermi energy. The theoretical computed adsorption energy with ultrahigh sensitivity and fast recovery time suggests that SF6 decomposed gases reusability is achieved with CoOOH as a resistance-type gas sensor.

"Data-driven monitoring of powder build-up for condition-based maintenance in semiconductor manufacturing facility Purpose: Semiconductor fabrication facilities often suffer from undesired particle introduction into process chambers in vacuum systems. Ideally, it is unusual to observe particles formed in the exhaust pumping line inside the chamber, but non-volatile compound products at relatively low temperatures jeopardize the vacuum pumping system, gas scrubber and the wafer-in-process. This study proposes a monitoring system for constructing a complete condition-based maintenance system for diagnosing the powder build-up within exhaust pipes used in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. This system includes ultrasonic sensors and machine learning. Design/methodology/approach: Employing ultrasonic sensors, physical and data-driven models are established. The time- or frequency-domain data acquired by the monitoring system are converted into cepstrums for modeling the powder layer thickness using machine learning. Findings: The algorithms used in the proposed system successfully classified the thicknesses with an average accuracy of above 97%, and feature importance analysis identified the quefrency that varied with the thickness of the powder layer. Practical implications: The limitation of this research lies within the lab environment. It is unfortunate that the suggested method has not been evaluated in actual semiconductor manufacturing facilities, as powder build-up may take more than a few months to be called the facility maintenance. However, the submitted paper is still valid in academic and engineering aspects to be utilized in industry. Originality/value: We modeled the system using data acquired by an ultrasonic sensor, and we constructed a data-driven model that was trained using cepstral data to replace the physical models that monitor thickness.

"Robust recursive transformed component statistical analysis for incipient industrial fault detection with missing data In practical industrial processes, data integrity is often compromised by sensor malfunctions or issues in data management. Furthermore, incipient faults, which can escalate into severe accidents, are typically challenging to detect due to their subtle nature. This paper introduces a robust recursive transformed component statistical analysis method for detecting incipient faults in industrial processes with missing data. Within a sliding window, missing data are restored by minimizing the detection index in a recursive way, and the converged statistical model is then used for fault detection. The detectability of the proposed method is analyzed theoretically in scenarios with incomplete data. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments are conducted on both a numerical case study and the Tennessee Eastman process. The results demonstrate robust performance under incomplete training and testing data, enabling accurate detection of incipient faults in industrial settings. Furthermore, compared to existing methods, the proposed approach achieves significant improvements in fault detection under missing-data conditions, attaining a detection rate close to 100% for most fault scenarios while maintaining a near-zero false alarm rate. © 2025",2-s2.0-105008930432
"Single-phase fault diagnosis for five-phase permanent magnet synchronous motors based on neutral voltage observation Neutral voltage (NV) reflects the unbalanced condition of a five-phase permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM). Thus, it can be used to screen out the open-switch, open-phase, and inter-turn faults of a single phase, with a low rate of misdiagnosis. However, because there is no neutral point lead for most electric drives, the measurement of NV is difficult. To this end, an NV observation method is proposed in this paper by exploiting phase currents and reference pole voltages. This method can be regarded as a kind of multi-sensor information fusion technology. On this basis, a lock-in amplifier technique is further presented to calculate the frequency spectrum from the re-constructed NV, which achieves accurate classification of the stated single-phase faults. Finally, experimental results confirm the validity of the presented method in terms of fast and accurate location determination of open-switch, open-phase, and inter-turn short-circuit faults. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to The Korean Institute of Power Electronics.",2-s2.0-85156164229
"Predictive Maintenance in IoT-Monitored Systems for Fault Prevention This paper focuses on predictive maintenance for simple machinery systems monitored by the Internet of Things (IoT). As these systems can be challenging to model due to their complexity, diverse typologies, and limited operational lifespans, traditional predictive maintenance approaches face obstacles due to the lack of extensive historical data. To address this issue, we propose a novel clustering-based process that identifies potential machinery faults. The proposed approach lies in empowering decision-makers to define predictive maintenance policies based on the reliability of the proposed fault classification. Through a case study involving real sensor data from the doors of a transportation vehicle, specifically a bus, we demonstrate the practical applicability and effectiveness of our method in preemptively preventing faults and enhancing maintenance practices. By leveraging IoT sensor data and employing clustering techniques, our approach offers a promising avenue for cost-effective predictive maintenance strategies in simple machinery systems.

"A Multirate Sensor Information Fusion Strategy for Multitask Fault Diagnosis Based on Convolutional Neural Network In complicated mechanical systems, fault diagnosis, especially regarding feature extraction from multiple sensors, remains a challenge. Most existing methods for feature extraction tend to assume that all sensors have uniform sampling rates. However, complex mechanical systems use multirate sensors. These methods use upsampling for data preprocessing to ensure that all signals at the same scale can cause certain time-frequency features to vanish. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Multirate Sensor Information Fusion Strategy (MRSIFS) for multitask fault diagnosis. The proposed method is based on multidimensional convolution blocks incorporating multisource information fusion into the convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. Features with different sampling rates from the raw signals are run through a multichannel parallel fault feature extraction framework for fault diagnosis. Additionally, time-frequency analysis technology is used to reveal fault information in the association between time and frequency domains. The simulation platform's experimental results show that the proposed multitask model achieves higher diagnosis accuracy than the existing methods. Furthermore, manual feature selection for each task becomes unnecessary in MRSIFS, which has the potential toward a general-purpose framework.  © 2021 Xiangkai Ma et al.",2-s2.0-85108026893

"A novel interactive prognosis framework with nonlinear Wiener process and multi-sensor fusion for remaining useful life prediction Accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prediction plays a vital role in increasing the system operation safety and reducing maintenance costs. In industrial applications, there is usually a large amount of multi-sensor data generated. Therefore, how to construct an appropriate health index (HI) based on multi-sensor signals is very important for the RUL prediction. However, existing works treat sensor selection, HI construction, and degradation modeling independently as unrelated parts, which may result in the combination of sensors selected not constituting an optimal HI or the constructed HI not matching the degradation model. In addition, most existing works treat prior units as a whole to obtain a unique set of sensor combinations and fusion coefficients, which cannot reflect unit-to-unit heterogeneity, thus affecting the accuracy of RUL prediction. Therefore, a novel interactive feedback framework is established to construct HI, where the sensor selection, fusion coefficient calculation, and nonlinear Wiener process degradation modeling are incorporated into the feedback. Furthermore, an adaptive weight selection method based on particle swarm optimization and leave-one-out cross-validation (PSO-LV) is proposed to adjust the fusion coefficients in real-time. Then, the RUL is estimated by updating model parameters online, detecting degradation trends, and deriving the probability density function (PDF) of the RUL.

To address this issue, we introduce a probabilistic graphical model to examine the probabilistic relationships among sensor signals, remaining useful life (RUL), and health indices. Based on the graphical model, three types of conditional probabilistic autoencoders are combined to develop the health indices of a complex aero-propulsion system.

"Analysis of thermal environment and energy performance by biased economizer outdoor air temperature sensor fault In order to develop a fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) algorithm for air handling unit (AHU) based on machine learning, the economizer outdodor air temperature (OAT) sensor fault was modeled. Through EnergyPlus program, the economizer OAT sensor modeled a fault that measures the OAT that’s higher or lower than the actual temperature. The distribution of abnormal node point air temperature produced by the fault at the control point of the economizer was reviewed. In addition, the relationship between OAT & mixed air temperature (MAT), OAT & outdoor air fraction (OAF), AHU cooling coil energy, and chiller energy were comparatively analyzed for each fault model. In the case of the fault models, although outdoor air suitable for cooling could be utilized during the operation, outdoor air was not introduced for cooling, and in the opposite case, outdoor air was introduced even when OAT was higher than the indoor set-point temperature, reducing the energy saving effect for cooling. In the future, we aim to analyze energy performance and indoor air quality according to the fault in the return air temperature (RAT) sensor and error in the opening position of the damper.

"Multisource Data Fusion Diagnosis Method of Rolling Bearings Based on Improved Multiscale CNN Intelligent diagnosis applies deep learning algorithms to mechanical fault diagnosis, which can classify the fault forms of machines or parts efficiently. At present, the intelligent diagnosis of rolling bearings mostly adopts a single-sensor signal, and multisensor information can provide more comprehensive fault features for the deep learning model to improve the generalization ability. In order to apply multisensor information more effectively, this paper proposes a multiscale convolutional neural network model based on global average pooling. The diagnostic model introduces a multiscale convolution kernel in the feature extraction process, which improves the robustness of the model. Meanwhile, its parallel structure also makes up for the shortcomings of the multichannel input fusion method. In the multiscale fusion process, the global average pooling method is used to replace the way to reshape the feature maps into a one-dimensional feature vector in the traditional convolutional neural network, which effectively retains the spatial structure of the feature maps. The model proposed in this paper has been verified by the bearing fault data collected by the experimental platform.

At the same time, operation and maintenance (O&M) of offshore wind farms are progressively focusing on the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) for enhancing the efficiency and performance of the wind energy facilities. Decision support strategies based on failure predictions are an important element in this trend. As a result, AI is more frequently used to create time-to-failure predictions based on large amount of data collected from sensors deployed to wind turbines. Nevertheless, unsupervised components or subsystems may occasionally lead to failures. This paper demonstrates a practical application of AI for predicting failures in unsupervised components. Specifically, we focus on a single component: the yaw brakes of a 3 MW wind turbine. The study analyses how the brake pads of these yaw brakes wear out over time, using the data collected from turbine controllers. To predict when these failures are likely to occur, we employ Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) which is empowered by a pre-processed dataset using Support Vector Machine (SVM) for clustering of the relevant data.

"Root cause diagnosis for process faults based on multisensor time-series causality discovery Root cause diagnosis (RCD) focuses on locating the critical root causes and identifying the propagation paths of the industrial process faults, which is superior to conventional fault diagnosis methods and has attracted extensive attention. However, RCD is challenging in terms of dense sensor layout and diversified interconnected subsystems in complex industrial processes, since a fault originating in one unit can propagate throughout the entire plant along with the flow of information and material, obscuring its root causes. Moreover, the previous RCD methods ignore the more crucial temporal information between multisensor time-series, suffering from the disadvantages of requiring expert knowledge and responding untimely. Therefore, a novel data-driven RCD methodology named multisensor time-series causality discovery (MTCD) is proposed for industrial processes fault diagnosis. Firstly, a temporal registration network (TRN) based on the dilated convolutional neural network (DCNN) is proposed to extract the temporal correlation between time-series and implement the time-series prediction. Ulteriorly, a permutation importance causality validation (PICV) is designed to verify the causality between time-series based on the TRN prediction results without prior knowledge or expert experience. Besides, a causal time delay discovery approach based on layerwise relevance propagation (LRP) is presented by interpreting the weights of the trained TRN. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with a stochastic synthesis process and the Tennessee Eastman process. The experimental results show that the proposed method has better performance in both root cause localization and propagation path identification. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85144386052
"Analytical vibration signal model and signature analysis in resonance region for planetary gearbox fault diagnosis Complex components and multi-modulations characterize planetary gearbox vibration signals. As the vibration signals become time-varying under nonstationary conditions, it is difficult to extract fault features around meshing frequency harmonics, since they are all dependent on speed, and change under time-varying speed conditions. To address this issue, we turn to the resonance region and exploit the time-invariability of resonance frequency and the sideband symmetry around resonance frequency for planetary gearbox fault diagnosis under both constant and time-varying speed conditions. Gear fault generates impulses and thereby excites resonance of the planetary gearbox and even the measurement system. As such, gear fault information can be explored in the resonance region. To thoroughly understand gear fault vibration features in resonance region, the vibration signal is modeled as an amplitude modulation and frequency modulation (AM-FM) process, considering the multi-modulations due to gear fault, time-varying vibration transmission path, and time-varying angle between mesh line of action and measurement axis of vibration sensor. Furthermore, explicit time-varying Fourier spectra under nonstationary conditions are derived. Sideband symmetry features around resonance frequency can be utilized to detect gear fault. This is a major progress and contribution in contrast to reported researches that focus on meshing frequency or its harmonics only. Resonance frequency identification is the key to gear fault feature extraction in resonance region. An on-line resonance frequency identification method under time-varying speeds is proposed by exploiting the nature of resonance independence of running conditions. To effectively pinpoint the time-varying sidebands in the time-frequency domain, the iterative generalized demodulation (IGD) method is used to achieve high time-frequency resolution and to avoid both outer and inner interferences at the same time. The theoretical derivations and proposed method are validated through numerical simulation and lab experiments. Gear fault features are extracted in the resonance region of the planetary gearbox and the accelerometer under time-varying speed conditions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85099829631
"IoT Based Predictive Maintenance Management of Medical Equipment Technological advancements are the main drivers of the healthcare industry as it has a high impact on delivering the best patient care. Recent years witnessed unprecedented growth in the number of medical equipment manufactured to aid high-quality patient care at a fast pace. With this growth of medical equipment, hospitals need to adopt optimal maintenance strategies that enhance the performance of their equipment and attempt to reduce their maintenance costs and effort. In this work, a Predictive Maintenance (PdM) approach is presented to help in failure diagnosis for critical equipment with various and frequent failure mode(s). The proposed approach relies on the understanding of the physics of failure, real-time collection of the right parameters using the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, and utilization of machine learning tools to predict and classify healthy and faulty equipment status. Moreover, transforming traditional maintenance into PdM has to be supported by an economic analysis to prove the feasibility and efficiency of transformation. The applicability of the approach was demonstrated using a case study from a local hospital in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) where the Vitros-Immunoassay analyzer was selected based on maintenance events and criticality assessment as a good candidate for transforming maintenance from corrective to predictive. The dominant failure mode is metering arm belt slippage due to wear out of belt and movement of pulleys which can be predicted using vibration signals. Vibration real data is collected using wireless accelerometers and transferred to a signal analyzer located on a cloud or local computer. Features extracted and selected are analyzed using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to detect the faulty condition. In terms of economics, the proposed approach proved to provide significant diagnostic and repair cost savings that can reach up to 25% and an investment payback period of one year. The proposed approach is scalable and can be used across medical equipment in large medical centers. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2-s2.0-85079737756
"Data-driven prognostics method for turbofan engine degradation using hybrid deep neural network Powerful sequence modeling capability for massive multi-sensor data enables deep-learning-based methods to obtain accurate remaining useful life (RUL) estimations. Hybrid neural networks, with learned representations based on various networks, have enhanced the prognostics accuracies than single networks. However, assembly strategies that are limited to either parallel or serial, and insufficient utilization of single networks restrict the development of hybrid networks for more complex problems. This paper proposes a data-driven method using hybrid multi-scale convolutional neural network (MSCNN) and bi-directional long short-term memory (BLSTM) network (namely HMCB network) for RUL estimation. The framework of the network includes two parallel paths. One is composed of MSCNN and BLSTM in serial and the other is a BLSTM path. The HMCB network integrates the merits of multi-scale spatial feature extraction of MSCNN and sequence learning capacity of BLSTM. Validated by C-MAPSS dataset, the HMCB network demonstrates noticeably higher prognostic accuracy than other state-of-the-art methods. © 2021, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2-s2.0-85120793518
"Effectual Energy Optimization, Fault-Tolerant Attack Detection, and Data Aggregation in Healthcare IoT Using Enhanced Waterwheel Archimedes and Deep Siamese Maxout Forward Harmonic Networks The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has emerged as a transformative technology for improving healthcare delivery and patient outcomes. However, IoMT systems face significant challenges, including high latency, energy inefficiency, and vulnerability to cyberattacks, which compromise data security and patient privacy. Existing methods for attack detection and secure routing in IoMT often suffer from high latency, limited fault tolerance, and insufficient accuracy in identifying sophisticated attacks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes two novel approaches: the Improved Waterwheel Archimedes Optimization Algorithm (WWAOA) for secure routing and the Deep Siamese Maxout Forward Harmonic Network (DSMFHN) for attack detection in healthcare IoT. The Improved WWAOA integrates the Waterwheel Plant Algorithm (WWPA) with the Archimedes Optimization Algorithm (AOA) to optimize cluster head (CH) selection and secure routing. It considers key fitness parameters such as energy consumption, link lifetime (LLT), trust, delay, distance, and fault tolerance to enhance network efficiency and resilience. The DSMFHN combines Siamese Neural Networks (SNN) and Deep Maxout Networks (DMN) with forward harmonic analysis to detect attacks with high accuracy and low false positive rates. Additionally, data aggregation is performed using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) with adaptive weightage based on fault and malicious node detection. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform existing techniques. The Improved WWAOA achieves a minimal delay of 0.557 ms, maximal energy efficiency of 0.182 J, a packet delivery ratio (PDR) of 93.894%, and a trust value of 87.152. Meanwhile, the DSMFHN achieves a high accuracy of 92.598%, a true positive rate (TPR) of 91.643%, and a low false positive rate (FPR) of 0.156.

"A reliable fault-tolerant ANFIS model based data aggregation scheme for Wireless Sensor Networks Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are widely used in many applications like forest fire monitoring, environmental monitoring, search and rescue operations and weather monitoring etc. The WSNs are organized into clusters in order to conserve energy. A high level of reliability is necessary for using WSNs particularly in mission-critical applications like battlefield surveillance, disaster management etc. The node deployment is an essential feature of WSN. It is of two types- random and deterministic. An efficient node deployment scheme not only reduces the energy cost but also enhances the network lifetime. The paper proposes four deterministic WSN cluster deployment topology models – the square, the pentagonal, the hexagonal and the 3 × 3 grid model for fixed sensor deployment. The performance of the four proposed models are first analyzed using a Reliability Block Diagram (RBD) where the reliability value for each of the proposed models is calculated using the Sum of Disjoint Products (SDP) method. Then, the proposed models are compared through simulation for different performance metrics. The paper also proposes a Reliable Neuro-Fuzzy Optimization Model (RNFOM) data aggregation technique which combines the power of an ANFIS estimator for intra-cluster and inter-cluster fault detection in WSNs for different fault types with Gorti's Enhanced Homomorphic Cryptosystem (EHC) for imparting security to the network. Both the analytical and the simulation results confirm that the 3 × 3 WSN grid cluster deployment model powered with the proposed RNFOM data aggregation technique gives comparatively better performance and a longer network lifetime than the other proposed models for any clustered WSN. © 2017 The Authors",2-s2.0-85034416394

"A Semi-Supervised Federated Learning Fault Diagnosis Method Based on Adaptive Class Prototype Points for Data Suffered by High Missing Rate With the development of Autonomous Marine Vehicles, research on real-time health monitoring based on data from remote monitoring and shore-based control center has attracted more and more attention. However, the feature extraction capability of each local client model is limited by the size and quality of data collected by remote monitoring. For clients with zero-shot, it is necessary to design an efficient federated learning framework which allows shore-based federation center with few-shot help to strengthen the feature extraction capability of clients. In this paper, a semi-supervised federated learning strategy based on adaptive learning mechanism of prototype points is proposed to solve the problem that clients with zero-shot have difficulty in establishing reliable fault diagnosis models when the quality of client data is inhomogeneous. By designing an adaptive prototypical network learning mechanism driven by sample quality and a dynamic in-and-out mechanism for local pseudo-labeled dataset, the few-shot learning capability of federation center as well as the reliability of local client’s prototype points are enhanced to alleviate the impact of unreliable pseudo-label on semi-supervised learning. The experiment validation on the rolling bearing dataset provided by Case Western Reserve University can come to an accuracy increasement of 13.12%, which indicates that the proposed Adpro-SSFL outperforms existed semi-supervised federated learning method when data suffered by high missing rate due to the interference of external factors on the signal acquisition sensor. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",2-s2.0-85179654645
"Preparation of highly conductive and flexible Ag-coated single fiberglass via dopamine functionalization and electroless depositing Flexible conductive glass fibers had widespread acquired attention in the field of electromagnetic interference shielding, sensor, and intelligent wearable devices. However, commercial fiberglass (FG) were insulators that greatly limit their application fields. Herein, flexible single FG with diameter of nearly 25 µm was manufactured by a home-made equipment. Then the surface of FG was further functionalized by dopamine self-polymerization and formed a polydopamine linker layer to chelate Ag(I) ion. Finally, the consecutive silver nanoparticles were coated on PDM/FG (polydopamine/fiberglass) via electroless plating method (Ag-PDM/FG). The SEM, XPS, and XRD results demonstrated that the silver layer on the FG surface was compact, uniform, continuous, and in a metallic crystal state. The Ag-PDM/FG exhibited excellent electrical conductivity as high as 2.49 × 106 S m−1 and could easily operate as a conductive wire for a LED device. Furthermore, the Ag-PDM/FG maintained its original conductivity even under various bending angles due to the stable Ag-coated layer.

"Physics-informed symbolic regression for tool wear and remaining useful life predictions in manufacturing Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) plays a crucial role in enhancing the reliability and safety of engineering systems. Recently, physics-informed machine learning (PIML) methods have gained significant attention for their ability to incorporate domain-specific knowledge into data-driven models. This paper proposes a novel approach that integrates symbolic regression with recursive modeling to develop a robust framework for PHM of dynamic processes. Our framework was applied to a manufacturing process to build a generic model for tool wear prognostics across various machining scenarios. The proposed method integrates domain knowledge of milling processes under different conditions with recursive models using symbolic regression to achieve accurate and robust tool wear predictions. A recursive feature model and a recursive tool wear model were developedto accurately predict future tool wear, taking into consideration the strong correlation between features extracted from sensor signals and tool wear. The Genetic Programming-based Toolbox for Identification of Physical Systems (GPTIPS) was employed for symbolic regression. The results illustrate that the proposed framework can capture the dynamics of tool wear by recursively updating predictions with new data and can derive simple, interpretable mathematical expressions that represent the physical characteristics of the tool wear process.

"Towards data-driven quality monitoring for advanced metal inert gas welding processes in body-in-white In recent years, numerous monitoring approaches have been developed in the field of intelligent welding manufacturing to predict quality-related characteristics using process data and artificial intelligence-based techniques. While most investigations have focused on welding steel with conventional gas metal arc welding processes, the welding of aluminum and its alloys using advanced process variants has been less explored. This work addresses this gap by investigating data-driven methods for fault diagnosis and detection in an advanced metal inert gas welding process commonly used in body-in-white manufacturing. To this end, electrical, acoustic, and spectroscopic signals were recorded from numerous welding tests simulating typical fault causes. Various predictive models, ranging from traditional machine learning algorithms to state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, were trained and evaluated for classifying faulty seams and identifying their root causes. The results demonstrate that combining sensor data enhances the performance of predictive models compared to using individual sensors alone. However, a deep learning approach based solely on electrical signals emerged as the best solution for both use cases, considering both the results and practical aspects. Overall, the experiments highlight the significant potential of data-driven techniques to enhance quality monitoring in advanced MIG welding processes, promoting their more widespread adoption in body-in-white manufacturing. © 2024",2-s2.0-85208116930
"Physics-based modeling and information-theoretic sensor and settings selection for tool wear detection in precision machining Precision machining of metals is an energy intensive process with applications and impacts across the manufacturing industry. The energy efficiency, product yield, and maintenance of the precision machine require a digital twin that can assist with prognostics and health management. Here, a physics-based model is developed and validated against face milling data, and then used for the timely and precise inference of machining faults that cannot be measured directly. Computer numerical control (CNC) measurements of power and force are used through this physics-based machining model to predict deviations of the outputs of power consumption and cutting forces during normal operation. A model-based fault detection and isolation methodology is applied to determine the optimal (traditional and available) sensor suite and the test settings (admissible input values) that improve the inference of tool wear in face milling. The optimal sensor suite and input test settings are obtained by solving a mixed integer non-linear program that optimizes information-theoretic metrics relevant to the detection and isolation of tool wear from steady-state or transient machining measurements. Dynamic time warping and k—NN classification are then used to validate the robustness of the optimal design for fault detection test design, including the optimal sensor suite. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",2-s2.0-85133753690

"Baseline-free sensor fault detection for piezoelectric array In this study, a new methodology is presented to detect the sensor fault for piezoelectric array based on the filtered frequency response function (FRF) shapes. The proposed method does not require prior knowledge about healthy piezoelectric array. First, the imaginary parts of FRFs from the piezoelectric array during vibration are measured and normalized to obtain the FRF shapes in different frequencies. Then the irregularities in these FRF shapes are extracted by using high-pass filter with properly chosen cut-off frequency. These abnormal irregularities on the filtered FRF shape curves indicate the location of the faulty sensor, due to the irregularity of FRF shapes introduced by the faulty piezoelectric element. The proposed sensor fault method is experimentally demonstrated on a clamped-clamped steel beam mounted with piezoelectric buzzer array.

"A multisensory time-frequency features fusion method for rotating machinery fault diagnosis under nonstationary case Mechanical system fault diagnosis is essential to save costs and ensure safety. Generally, rotating machinery operates in nonstationary cases, which makes fault features complex and difficult to identify. However, existing fault diagnosis methods have the following limitations. (1) Consider only time or frequency domain features fusion. (2) Extract the fusion features representation only in the Euclidean domain. Based on that, a novel method based on multisensory time-frequency features fusion and graph attention network is proposed for rotating machinery fault diagnosis under the nonstationary case. First, the multi-sensor time series are converted into multi-sensor time-frequency maps by image-to-matrix, matrix concatenation, and matrix-to-image operations. Then, simple linear iterative clustering is applied to make the superpixels in the multi-sensor time-frequency maps into nodes and form graphs based on color and texture features. Finally, the graph attention network with residual connection is applied to distinguish the rotating machinery’s health status.

"A Physics-Based Model-Data-Driven Method for Spindle Health Diagnosis—Part III: Model Training and Fault Detection The primary goal of the paper is to monitor the health of the spindle in machine tools to ensure optimal performance and reduce costly downtimes. Spindle health monitoring is essential to detect wear and cracks in spindle bearings, which can be challenging due to their gradual development and hidden locations. The proposed approach combines physics-based modeling and data-driven techniques to monitor spindle health effectively. In Part I and Part II of the paper, mathematical models of bearing faults and spindle imbalance are integrated into the digital model of the spindle. This allows for simulating the operation of the spindle both with and without faults. The integration of fault models enables the generation of vibrations at sensor locations along the spindle shaft. The generated vibration data from the physics-based model are used to train a recurrent neural network-based (RNN) fault detection algorithm. The RNN learns from the labeled vibration spectra to identify different fault conditions. Bayesian optimization is used to automatically tune the hyperparameters governing the accuracy and efficiency of the learning models during the training process. The RNN classifiers are further fine-tuned using a small set of experimentally collected data for the generalization of the model on real-world data. Once the RNN classifier is trained, it can distinguish between different types of damage and identify their specific locations on the spindle assembly.

The gear in the gear train was subjected to vibration analysis which was captured via a sensor. Signal processing was carried out using MATLAB Toolbox. To automatically identify the flaws in the helical gearbox, an artificial neural network (ANN) and several machines learning methods, including KNN, decision tree, random forest, and SMV, were trained by creating a database from the experiment conducted. The outcomes showed potential in accurately classifying the faults. The results show that ANN has the highest accuracy of 99.6% with a 6.5662 seconds computational time while SVM has the lowest accuracy of 96% among them along with the highest computational time of 21.324 seconds.  © 2024-IOS Press.

"An adaptive transfer fault detection method for rotary machine with multi-sensor information fusion Multi-sensor information fusion method has good performance in fault detection of rotary machine, in which each sensor information has made different contributions. The contribution of each sensor changes based on the working conditions of the machine, which can lead to a degradation in the performance of the transfer method when used in cross-domain mechanical fault detection. To solve this problem, an adaptive transfer fault detection method for rotary machine with multi-sensor information fusion is proposed. Firstly, multi-sensor data under different working conditions is collected, and features of different sensors are extracted by the corresponding deep learning model. Secondly, the multi-information interaction fusion network is designed to exchange sensor information and obtain fusion features. Then the fusion feature transfer model is proposed for cross-domain fault detection. Finally, the model is trained with the bearing dataset of the University of Paderborn. The results show that the transfer fault detection method with multi-sensor information fusion achieves state-of-the-art performances in cross-domain fault detection. It can adjust adaptively the contribution of each sensor information in the cross-domain fault detection. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",2-s2.0-85200155799
"Machine Learning Application Using Cost-Effective Components for Predictive Maintenance in Industry: A Tube Filling Machine Case Study Maintenance is an activity that cannot be separated from the context of product manufacturing. It is carried out to maintain the components’ or machines’ function so that no failure can reduce the machine’s productivity. One type of maintenance that can mitigate total machine failure is predictive maintenance. Predictive maintenance, along with the times, no longer relies on visuals or other senses but can be combined into automated observations using machine learning methods. It can be applied to a toothpaste factory with a tube filling machine by combining the results of sensor observations with machine learning methods. This research aims to increase the Overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) to 10% by predicting the components that will be damaged. The machine learning methods tested in this study are random forest regression and linear regression. This study indicates that the prediction accuracy of machine learning with the random forest regression method for PHM predictive is 88%of the actual data, and linear regression has an accuracy of 59% of the actual data. After implementing the system on the machine for three months, the OEE value increased by 13.10%, and unplanned machine failure decreased by 62.38% in the observed part.

"Active fault-tolerant control of rotation angle sensor in steer-by-wire system based on multi-objective constraint fault estimator Purpose – Steer-by-wire (SBW) system mainly relies on sensors, controllers and motors to replace the traditionally mechanical transmission mechanism to realize steering functions. However, the sensors in the SBW system are particularly vulnerable to external influences, which can cause systemic faults, leading to poor steering performance and even system instability. Therefore, this paper aims to adopt a fault-tolerant control method to solve the safety problem of the SBW system caused by sensors failure. Design/methodology/approach – This paper proposes an active fault-tolerant control framework to deal with sensors failure in the SBW system by hierarchically introducing fault observer, fault estimator, fault reconstructor. Firstly, the fault observer is used to obtain the observation output of the SBW system and then obtain the residual between the observation output and the SBW system output. And then judge whether the SBW system fails according to the residual. Secondly, dependent on the residual obtained by the fault observer, a fault estimator is designed using bounded real lemma and regional pole configuration to estimate the amplitude and time-varying characteristics of the faulty sensor. Eventually, a fault reconstructor is designed based on the estimation value of sensors fault obtained by the fault estimator and SBW system output to tolerate the faulty sensor. Findings – The numerical analysis shows that the fault observer can be rapidly activated to detect the fault while the sensors fault occurs. Moreover, the estimation accuracy of the fault estimator can reach to 98%, and the fault reconstructor can make the faulty SBW system to retain the steering characteristics, comparing to those of the fault-free SBW system. In addition, it was verified for the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control framework. Research limitations/implications – As the SBW fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control in this paper only carry out numerical simulation research on sensors faults in matrix and laboratory/Simulink, the subsequent hardware in the loop test is needed for further verification. Originality/value – Aiming at the SBW system with parameter perturbation and sensors failure, this paper proposes an active fault-tolerant control framework, which integrates fault observer, fault estimator and fault reconstructor so that the steering performance of SBW system with sensors faults is basically consistent with that of the fault-free SBW system. © Qinjie Yang, Guozhe Shen, Chao Liu, Zheng Wang, Kai Zheng and Rencheng Zheng.",2-s2.0-85134469386
"Dynamic spatial–temporal graph-driven machine remaining useful life prediction method using graph data augmentation It is beneficial to maintain the normal operation of machines by conducting remaining useful life (RUL) prediction. Recently, graph data-driven machine RUL prediction methods have made a great success, since graph can model spatial and temporal dependencies of signals. However, the constructed graphs still have some limitations: (1) In the practical industrial production, the installation of multi-sensor networks is expensive and hard to achieve, so the single sensor is commonly used for data monitoring. However, most of these methods constructed graphs by establishing relationships between the different sensors, which are completely unsuitable for prediction tasks in single-sensor scenarios. (2) The quality of constructed graph is low, where the graph structure is fixed, failing in representing the machine degradation process. To overcome these limitations, a dynamic spatial–temporal (ST) graph-driven machine RUL prediction method using graph data augmentation (GDA) is proposed. The ST graph is constructed using short-time Fourier transform, capturing the frequency-domain and time-domain information hidden in the signals. Then, a GDA framework is designed to generate dynamic ST graphs, enlarging the structural differences of subgraphs. Subsequently, a GDA-based graph deep learning prediction model is constructed for dynamic ST graph-based RUL prediction, where an autoencoder-based graph embedding module is designed to replace simple Readout. Verification experiments are conducted on two case studies, and the results show that the proposed prediction method achieves a competitive performance. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2-s2.0-85142417062
"Real-time prediction of propulsion motor overheating using machine learning Thermal protection in marine electrical propulsion motors is commonly implemented by installing temperature sensors on the windings of the motor. An alarm is issued once the temperature reaches the alarm limit, while the motor shuts down once the trip limit is reached. Field experience shows that this protection scheme in some cases is insufficient, as the motor may already be damaged before reaching the trip limit. In this paper, we develop a machine learning algorithm to predict overheating, based on past data collected from a class of identical vessels. All methods were implemented to comply with real-time requirements of the on-board protective systems with minimal need for memory and computational power. Our two-stage overheating detection algorithm first predicts the temperature in a normal state using linear regression fitted to regular operation motor performance measurements, with exponentially smoothed predictors accounting for time dynamics. Then it identifies and monitors temperature deviations between the observed and predicted temperatures using an adaptive cumulative sum (CUSUM) procedure. Using data from a real fault case, the monitor alerts between 60 to 90 min before failure occurs, and it is able to detect the emerging fault at temperatures below the current alarm limits. © 2021 Institute of Marine Engineering, Science & Technology.",2-s2.0-85114877333
"Online tool condition monitoring for ultrasonic metal welding via sensor fusion and machine learning In ultrasonic metal welding (UMW), tool wear significantly affects the weld quality and tool maintenance constitutes a substantial part of production cost. Thus, tool condition monitoring (TCM) is crucial for UMW. Despite extensive literature focusing on TCM for other manufacturing processes, limited studies are available on TCM for UMW. Existing TCM methods for UMW require offline high-resolution measurement of tool surface profiles, which leads to undesirable production downtime and delayed decision-making. This paper proposes a completely online TCM system for UMW using sensor fusion and machine learning (ML) techniques. A data acquisition (DAQ) system is designed and implemented to obtain in-situ sensing signals during welding processes. A large feature pool is then extracted from the sensing signals. A subset of features are selected and subsequently used by ML-based classification models. A variety of classification models are trained, validated, and tested using experimental data. The best-performing classification models can achieve close to 100% classification accuracy for both training and test datasets. The proposed TCM system not only provides real-time TCM for UMW but also can support optimal decision-making in tool maintenance. The TCM system can be extended to predict remaining useful life (RUL) of tools and integrated with a controller to adjust welding parameters accordingly. © 2020 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",2-s2.0-85099501543
"A case study on remote instrumentation of vibration and temperature in bearing housings Data collection is one of the most relevant topics of modern automation and industry. It is usually a costly and time-consuming task, especially in continuous processes. Our case study takes place in a sugar cane mill. The required continuous operation of a belt conveyor for bagasse transportation makes it a critical system in the overall production process. Therefore, a predictive maintenance tool is highly applicable here. We identified bearing housings as critical points for data collection intended for prognostics of the conveyor. However, given the number of points, the cost of a commercial solution becomes unfeasible by our company. This paper reports the development of low-cost devices for measurements and wireless transmission of vibration and temperature data from bearing housings. We assessed several sensor options and made decisions based on a cost-suitability commitment, which led to the design of the electronic devices. The devices were tested for correct operation, reliability (99%), and relative measurement errors under 1.2%. From the tests, we conclude that our proposal is appropriate for our case study’s industrial needs and budget restrictions. © 2021 by the authors.

"Global fast terminal sliding mode based radial basis function neural network for accurate fault estimation in nonlinear systems The problem of quick and accurate fault estimation in nonlinear systems is addressed in this article by combining the technique of radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) and global fast terminal sliding mode control (GFTSMC) concept. A new strategy to update the neural network weights, by using the global fast terminal sliding surface instead of conventional error back propagation method, is introduced to achieve real time, quick and accurate fault estimation which is critical for fault tolerant control system design. The combination of online learning ability of RBFNN, to approximate any nonlinear function, and finite time convergence property of GFTSMC ensures quick detection and accurate estimation of faults in real time. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is demonstrated through simulations using a nonlinear model of a commercial aircraft and considering a wide range of sensors and actuators faults. The simulation results show that the proposed method is capable of quick and accurate online fault estimation in nonlinear systems and shows improved performance as compared to conventional RBFNN and other techniques existing in literature. © 2022-IOS Press.

"Analysis of models for IoT-driven predictive maintenance under constraints in the case of the biopharmaceutical industry Following the advent of the Industry 4.0 concept twelve years ago, the widespread use of digitalisation, connected objects and massive databases is revolutionising industrial processes. The data generated by production equipment is becoming more diversified and can be used in areas such as maintenance, leading to an evolution in practices that were previously exclusively based on corrective maintenance towards condition-based or even predictive maintenance. Such evolution entails enhancing maintenance plans centred on schedules established in accordance with manufacturers’ recommendations in favour of active listening and monitoring of equipment, enabling maintenance to be carried out with maximum precision, i.e. using the maximum amount of information available from the monitored equipment, while minimising the risk of failure. These evolutions in maintenance practices, otherwise known as IoT (Internet of Things) based maintenance or “IOT-driven maintenance” are described in the scientific literature for most manufacturing industries. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the lag in scientific research in the biopharmaceutical sector compared to the manufacturing industry in general, as well as the use of IoT-based methods in the biopharmaceutical sector. This literature review has enabled us to identify a significant gap in IoT-based maintenance research, particularly in the biopharmaceutical sector.

"Development of data-driven, physics-based, and hybrid prognosis frameworks: a case study for gear remaining useful life prediction Data-driven, physics-based, and hybrid prognosis frameworks can be developed to estimate remaining useful life, depending on the availability of condition monitoring sensor data and physics-governing equations. No systematic study is available that shows the comparative performance of these frameworks. The present study, for the first time, attempts to show how these three frameworks can be developed under different scenarios and assumptions. The data-driven prognosis framework is developed using an accelerometer signal and an Artificial Intelligence-based random forest regression (RFR) model. A pit growth model inspired by the Paris crack growth law has been used for physics-based prognosis framework development. In this framework, sensor data is needed to know the gear’s current health status, as the prognosis framework can't be developed purely on physics. A hybrid prognosis framework is developed using two alternate approaches: one in which current health status is obtained directly from a visual inspection camera and the other in which this status is indirectly inferred from the accelerometer sensor data. In each case, the RUL prediction is made using a physics-based pit growth model coupled with the current health status obtained from either of the two approaches mentioned. To enhance the prediction accuracy, Bayesian inference is used to update the physics-based pit growth model parameters in both hybrid frameworks. Data obtained from five run-to-failure experiments performed on a specially designed gearbox test setup are used to show the comparative performance of these frameworks. The strengths and weaknesses of each of the frameworks are discussed based on the type of data requirement, model definition, parameter estimation, and prediction error. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",2-s2.0-85201387803
"Sensorless adaptive sliding mode position control for piezoelectric actuators with charge leakage Position control of piezoelectric actuators is greatly affected by nonlinearities such as hysteresis and creep. Therefore, precise position sensors must be utilized which have high cost and complicated structures in micro scales. Charge-based position estimation is an alternative method which resorts to piezoelectric linear charge-position property to estimate the actuator position, but in low-impedance actuators, there is a charge leakage caused by actuator internal resistance which deteriorates the position estimation and closed-loop control performance. In this article, the leakage is considered as a sensor fault. Therefore, a combination of charge measurement method and an appropriate observer is designed to detect and isolate the mentioned fault and estimate the actuator position properly. In addition, an adaptive sliding mode control procedure is proposed for trajectory tracking in the presence of estimated states. The required analysis is carried out to guarantee the closed-loop stability. Finally, experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. © The Author(s) 2019.",2-s2.0-85074111219
"A cyber-physical production system for autonomous part quality control in polymer additive manufacturing material extrusion process This paper introduces a successful implementation of a Cyber-Physical Production System (CPPS) for large-format 3D printing, employing the 5C framework and Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The CPPS focuses on achieving autonomous part quality control by monitoring three critical categories: the thermal behavior of the material during printing deposition, faulty detection of contour's parts being produced, and machine integrity based on component performance. This study reveals that current temperature data on 3D printers does not accurately reflect the physical part deposition temperature by an average offset of 30%. Real-time thermal readings demonstrate potential for accurate monitoring and control of the printing process. Tests validate the CPPS’s efficacy in detecting faults in real-time, significantly enhancing overall part quality production by an accuracy detection of 99.7%. Integration of different cameras, image processing, and machine learning algorithms facilitates fault detection and self-awareness of printed parts, providing insights into the mechanical condition of the printer. The combination of machine learning and image processing reduces the need for continuous operator intervention, optimizing production processes and minimizing losses. In conclusion, the implemented CPPS offers a robust solution for achieving autonomous part quality control in large-format 3D printing, showcasing advancements in real-time monitoring, fault detection, and overall improvement in the additive manufacturing process for large scale production implementation.

"Conceptual Design of a Vibration Test System Based on a Wave Generator Channel for Lab-Scale Offshore Wind Turbine Jacket Foundations Structural health monitoring (SHM) systems are designed to continually monitor the health of structures (e.g., civil, aeronautic) by using the information collected through a distributed sensor network. However, performing tests on real structures, such as wind turbines, implies high logistic and operational costs. Therefore, there is a need for a vibration test system to evaluate designs at smaller scales in a laboratory setting in order to collect data and devise predictive maintenance strategies. In this work, the proposed vibration test system is based on a lab-scale wind turbine jacket foundation related primarily to an offshore environment. The test system comprises a scaled wave generator channel, a desktop application (WTtest) to control the channel simulations, and a data acquisition system (DAQ) to collect the information from the sensors connected to the structure. Various equipment such as accelerometers, electrodynamic shaker, and DAQ device are selected as per the design methodology. Regarding the mechanical part, each component of the channel is designed to be like the wave absorber, the mechanical multiplier, the piston-type wavemaker, and the wave generator channel. For this purpose, the finite element method is used in static and fatigue analysis to evaluate the stresses and deformations; this helps determine whether the system will work safely. Moreover, the vibration test system applies to other jacket structures as well, giving it greater utility and applicability in different research fields.

Intelligent Diagnostic System for Mechanical Fault Detection Using Deep Learning Advanced diagnostic tools are essential for aerospace transportation systems and automotive industries and industrial manufacturing facilities since operational efficiency requirements and safety needs demand failure prediction tools. Systems that use traditional diagnostic methods depend on centralized architectures that show limitations regarding scalability while being unable to overcome subsystem failure events effectively. The research presents Gossip Neural Network (GNN) as a decentralized deep learning (DL) system which determines Remaining Useful Life (RUL) duration in distributed mechanical engine systems. The GNN combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long short-term Memory (LSTM) network layers to identify short-term sensor anomalies in addition to capturing long-term sensor degeneration patterns in sensor data. A gossip-based protocol allows the GNN to facilitate distributed engine subsystems which train a shared model together through peer-to-peer collaborations without needing central control.

"A Digital Twin-based condition monitoring system to detect and resolve web slip at traction rollers in a web processing machine Slippage of web material over rollers is an undesirable phenomenon in web processing applications, causing damage to the web material. This leads to compromised quality and increased waste. While web slippage is commonly observed at high web speeds due to air entrapment on freely rotating rollers, it also occurs at lower web speeds at the traction rollers, which are designed to drive the web through the machine. Installing web speed sensors to detect such web slippage on multiple traction rollers in large-scale web processing machines is expensive. This work presents a novel Digital Twin methodology for online condition monitoring and fault detection to identify web slip at the traction rollers. The Digital Twin uses the contact forces between the web and the traction roller to detect web slippage, greatly reducing the need for web speed sensors and thereby cutting costs and time. Additionally, in response to detected web slip, the newly proposed Digital Twin further acts to resolve the slip. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Digital Twin in detecting and resolving web slippage on three different web materials. © 2025",2-s2.0-105007091118

"Technical language processing for Prognostics and Health Management: applying text similarity and topic modeling to maintenance work orders Modern manufacturing paradigms have incorporated Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) to implement data-driven methods for fault detection, failure prediction, and assessment of system health. The maintenance operation has similarly benefitted from these advancements, and predictive maintenance is now being used across the industry. Despite these developments, most of the approaches in maintenance rely on numerical data from sensors and field devices for any sort of analysis. Text data from Maintenance Work Orders (MWOs) contain some of the most crucial information pertaining to the functioning of systems and components, but are still regarded as ‘black holes’, i.e., they store valuable data without being used in decision-making. The analysis of this data can help save time and costs in maintenance. While Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods have been very successful in understanding and examining text data from non-technical sources, progress in the analysis of technical text data has been limited. Non-technical text data are usually structured and consist of standardized vocabularies allowing the use of out-of-the-box language processing methods in their analysis. On the other hand, records from MWOs are often semi-structured or unstructured; and consist of complicated terminologies, technical jargon, and industry-specific abbreviations. Deploying traditional NLP to such data can result in an imprecise and flawed analysis which can be very costly. Owing to these challenges, we propose a Technical Language Processing (TLP) framework for PHM. To illustrate its capabilities, we use text data from MWOs of aircraft to address two scenarios. First, we predict corrective actions for new maintenance problems by comparing them with existing problems using syntactic and semantic textual similarity matching and evaluate the results with cosine similarity scores. In the second scenario, we identify and extract the most dominant topics and salient terms from the data using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Using the results, we are able to successfully link maintenance problems to standardized maintenance codes used in the aviation industry. © The Author(s) 2024.",2-s2.0-85187283526

"Multi-scale deep coupling convolutional neural network with heterogeneous sensor data for intelligent fault diagnosis With the innovation and development of detection technology, various types of sensors are installed to monitor the operating status of equipment in modern industry. Compared with the same type of sensors for monitoring, heterogeneous sensors can collect more comprehensive complementary fault information. Due to the large distribution differences and serious noise pollution of heterogeneous sensor data collected in industrial sites, this brings certain challenges to the development of heterogeneous data fusion strategies. In view of the large distribution difference in the feature spatial of heterogeneous data and the difficulty of effective fusion of fault information, this paper presents a multi-scale deep coupling convolutional neural network (MDCN), which is used to map the heterogeneous fault information from different feature spaces to the common spaces for full fusion. Specifically, a multi-scale convolution module (MSC) with multiple filters of different sizes is adopted to extract multi-scale fault features of heterogeneous sensor data. Then, the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) is applied to measure the distance between different spatial features in the coupling layer, and the common failure information in the heterogeneous data is mined by minimizing MMD to fuse effectively in order to identify the failure state of the device. The validity of this method is verified by the data collected on a first-level parallel gearbox mixed fault experiment platform. © 2021 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.",2-s2.0-85113211167
"Digital-Triplet: a new three entities digital-twin paradigm for equipment fault diagnosis Current equipment fault diagnosis faces challenges due to the difficulties in arranging sensors to collect effective data and obtaining diverse fault data for studying fault mechanisms. The lack of data results in disconnection between data from different spaces, posing a challenge to forming a closed loop of data and hindering the development of digital twin (DT) driven fault diagnosis (FD). To address these issues, a new DT paradigm Digital-Triplet is proposed. This paradigm comprises three entities: a physical entity, a semi-physical entity, and a virtual entity. A semi-physical entity is created by implementing the ""six-D"" process on the physical entity. A new six dimensional structure is formed through the addition of the semi-physical entity. The new structure streamlines the construction of fault datasets, enhances sensor data acquisition, and tightly links different data spaces, thereby promoting the application of DT in equipment FD.

"Navigation Algorithm-Agnostic Integrity Monitoring based on Solution Separation with Constrained Computation Time and Sensor Noise Overbounding Integrity monitoring (IM) in autonomous navigation has been extensively researched, but currently available solutions are mainly applicable to specific algorithms and sensors, or limited by linearity or 'Gaussianity' assumptions. This study investigates a Solution Separation (SS) based framework for universal IM, scalable to multi-sensor fusion as each hypothesis assumes a whole sensor measurement set as faulty. Architecturally we consider that: 1) multi sensor systems must account for various sensor noise models which lead to inconsistent estimates of uncertainties, 2) a module must be able to detect sensor failure or sensor noise mismodeling and suggest better bounds for the error, without being constantly conservative, 3) some algorithms are computationally heavy to monitor in the SS setting or the provided covariances cannot be interpreted in IM. A hybrid SS architecture can be practical, where some solutions are evaluated with a navigation algorithm with known characteristics, although the all-sensor-in solution is evaluated with the monitored algorithm. Experiments are run on filter and smoothing-based navigation algorithms. In addition, we experiment with hybrid SS monitoring and time-correlated noise to evaluate the appropriability of our framework in the context of the above-mentioned requirements. This is a novel framework in the IM domain, directly integrable in existing navigation solutions and, in our opinion, it will facilitate the quantification of the effect of different sensors in navigation safety. © 2022, The Author(s).",2-s2.0-85136861506

Residuals are generated by computing the Kullback-Leibler Divergence between the probability distribution of the predicted estimation with updated estimation obtained from sensors measurements. In order to isolate encoder and actuator faults, a secondary information filter with a prediction model based on a closed-loop controller is added. An additional bank of filters is developed, and extra residuals based on the Kullback-Leibler Divergence are generated. In the proposed method, the two designed filters supervise each other, which improves fault diagnosis, by taking into account all available information of the system, from control objective to multi-sensor data fusion. Actuator and sensor faults are treated within the same frame during the fusion process, and multiple faults occurrence is considered. A real-time experimentation on a real differential mobile robot is performed and demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed method. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",2-s2.0-85074370875
"Deep learning for bearing fault diagnosis under different working loads and non-fault location point Intelligent fault diagnosis using deep learning has achieved much success in recent years. Using deep learning method to diagnose bearing fault requires designing an appropriate neural network model and then train with a massive data. On the one hand, up to now, a variety of neural network structures have been proposed for different diagnostic tasks, but there is a lack of research of unified structure. On the other hand, the fault data of the training neural network are collected from the fault location point, which is quite different from the actual data, because the sensor cannot be located at the fault location point accurately. This paper attempts to design a unified neural network structure based on Resnet and improve the generalization performance by using transfer learning techniques. The effectiveness of the proposed method in this paper is verified using experiment under different working loads and non-fault location point. © The Author(s) 2019.",2-s2.0-85077441836
"Research on a small sample feature transfer method for fault diagnosis of reciprocating compressors The assumption of a data-driven fault diagnosis model is that both the training data and the test data come from the same probability distribution. In the diagnosis of reciprocating compressors, problems such as sensor failures and changes in installation locations often occur, making it difficult to obtain effective, stable and sufficient data. The sample data is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the fault diagnosis model. We propose a fault diagnosis method for reciprocating compressors based on feature transfer at small sample sizes. First, the sample data is projected to the Regenerated Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) using Transfer Component Analysis (TCA). Second, the minimization of distributional differences across domains is measured by the maximum mean difference (MMD). Then, combined with the adaptive feature extraction capability of Deep Belief Network (DBN), the already labeled source domain and unlabeled target domain data are aggregated during the training phase to diagnose faults. This approach uses a novel optimized learning approach, free energy in persistent contrastive divergence, in DBN learning and training. It solves the problem of DBN classification ability degradation in long-term training. Finally, a low-power single-acting reciprocating compressor experimental platform is built to carry out fault diagnosis experiments. The research results show that better diagnostic accuracy can be obtained by reducing the distribution difference of source and target domain data in projected high-dimensional RKHS through the common transfer components learned by TCA. Compared with traditional small-sample machine learning algorithms and DBN models, this approach has strong generalization ability, and the accuracy rate is as high as 92%. This study proves the superiority of both transfer learning (TL) and deep learning fault diagnosis models in solving the problem of less fault data and provides a theoretical reference for accurate fault diagnosis of complex dynamic equipment in the case of small samples. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85172866455
"Designing a shape-performance integrated digital twin based on multiple models and dynamic data: A boom crane example The digital twin, a concept that aims to establish a real-time mapping between physical space and virtual space, can be used for real-time analysis, reliability assessment, predictive maintenance, and design optimization of products. This article presents an enabling technology named shape-performance integrated digital twin (SPI-DT) and takes a boom crane as an example to illustrate how to design the SPI-DT step by step for the structural analysis of complex heavy equipment. The SPI-DT contains different types of models, such as an analytical model, a numerical model, and an artificial intelligence (AI) model. In addition, it leverages multisource dynamic data obtained by placing different sensors at multiple measurement positions. In the SPI-DT, the AI model plays a central role, invoking the numerical model and sensor data as the input to predict the structural performance of key components of heavy equipment, while the analytical model analyzes the structure of noncritical components with sensor data as input. This significantly improves the computational efficiency of the digital twin used for the structural analysis of complex heavy equipment, making the digital twin computationally affordable, and thus can be used for the safety assessment and damage protection of the equipment in the operation, as well as the design optimization of next-generation products. Moreover, to visually demonstrate the models and data in the SPI-DT, a three-dimensional application used to display and record the shape and performance information in real time during the operation of the boom crane is developed.

"Characterization of Abrasive Grain Signal of Oil Detection Sensor Based on LC Resonance Wireless Transmission Friction in marine engineering machinery produces abrasive particles containing valuable information. By employing oil detection technology, we can analyze these particles to monitor and diagnose mechanical system faults. This paper introduces an inductive oil detection sensor and wireless signal transmission circuit.

"Profile extraction and defect detection for stereolithography curing process based on multi-regularized tensor decomposition Optical lenses cured from the stereolithography process are still at their primitive stage, where the detection of process faults and product defects is of great importance. Such needed capability is enabled by an in situ process monitoring system with advanced camera sensors that collect high-dimensional images of the outer geometric profile and/or inner defects of the cured lenses. The state-of-the-art methods fall short in distinguishing the profile of the cured lens and the sparsely distributed spots from the curable resin shown in noisy images, leaving profile assessment and defect detection ineffective and unreliable. In this paper, a Multi-Regularized Tensor Decomposition (MRTD) Method is proposed to improve the performance of profile extraction and defect detection. It decomposes an in situ image of the curing process into four components: the smooth background, the smooth cured lens profile, the sparse spots, and the white noises. A modified ADMM algorithm is developed to solve this decomposition as a large-scale optimization problem. A real-world case study is conducted to demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods with respect to profile extraction accuracy and defect detection sensitivity. © 2024",2-s2.0-85187196543
"ROSI: A Robotic System for Harsh Outdoor Industrial Inspection - System Design and Applications Belt Conveyors are essential for transporting dry bulk material in different industries. Such structures require permanent inspections, traditionally executed by human operators based on cognition. To improve working conditions and process standardization, we propose a novel procedure to inspect conveyor structures with a ground robot composed by a mobile platform, a robotic arm, and a sensor-set. Based on field experience, we introduce ROSI, a new robotic device designed for long-term operations in harsh outdoor environments. The mobile robot has a hybrid locomotion system, using wheels to reduce energy consumption while covering long distances, and also flippers with tracks to improve mobility during obstacle negotiation. A mechanical passive switch allows decoupling tracks’ traction, reducing components wear and energy consumption without raising mechanical complexity. Aiming the robot-assisted operation, control strategies help to (i) command both the mobile platform and a robotic manipulator considering the system whole-body model, (ii) adjust the contact force for touching the conveyor structure during vibration inspection, and (iii) climb stairs while automatically adjusting the flippers. Machine Learning algorithms detect conveyors’ dirt build-ups, roller failures, and bearing faults by processing visual, thermal and sound data as inspection functionalities. The algorithms training and validation use a dataset collected from running conveyors at Vale, presenting detection accuracy superior to 90%. Field test results in a mining site demonstrate the robot capabilities to stand for the harsh operating conditions while executing all the required inspection tasks, stating ROSI as a disruptive solution for Belt Conveyor inspections and other general industrial operations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",2-s2.0-85114744584

"Fault Tolerant Control in Underwater Vehicles The article discusses the problem of adaptive system synthesis to provide the detection, estimation, and elimination of the negative consequences of faults in the thrusters of underwater robots and deviations of their parameters. For this purpose, an approach consisting of three stages is proposed. At the first stage, based on a bank of diagnostic observers, deviations of the thruster parameters from their nominal values or the occurrence of errors in the readings of its sensors are detected. At the second stage, the magnitudes of the detected deviations and errors are estimated using sliding mode observers. To estimate not only single but also multiple faults, the additional sliding mode observers are used. At the third stage, a control signal is generated to retain the basic dynamic properties of the thruster based on the estimated magnitudes of deviations and errors. Thus, the main contribution of this paper is designing the systems compensating for the consequences of faults occurring in the thrusters of the UR and errors in the readings of the angular velocity sensors. This avoids reducing the accuracy of movement along specified trajectories, as well as preventing accidents that could lead to the loss of the vehicle.

"Anomaly monitoring improves remaining useful life estimation of industrial machinery Estimating remaining useful life (RUL) of industrial machinery based on their degradation data is very critical for various industries. Machine learning models are powerful and very popular tools for predicting time to failure of such industrial machinery. However, RUL is ill-defined during healthy operation. This paper proposes to use anomaly monitoring during both RUL estimator training and deployment to tackle with this problem. In this approach, raw sensor data is monitored and when a statistically significant change is detected, it is taken as the degradation onset point and a data-driven RUL estimation model is triggered. Initial results with a simple anomaly detector, suited for non-varying operating conditions, and multiple RUL estimation models showed that the anomaly triggered RUL estimation scheme enhances the estimation accuracy, on in-house simulation and benchmark C-MAPSS turbofan engine degradation data.

"Intelligent monitoring of multi-axis robots for online diagnostics of unknown arm deviations In the age of Industry 4.0, multi-axis robots are widely used in smart manufacturing thanks to their capacity of milling high complex forms and interacting with several systems in production lines. However, during manufacturing, the occurrence of small drifts in the robot arms may lead to critical failures and significant product quality damages and, therefore, high financial losses. Hence, this paper aims to develop an effective and practical methodology for online diagnostics of robot drifts based on information fusion of direct and indirect monitoring. The direct monitoring exploits the already installed encoders on each servomotor of the robot while the indirect monitoring uses heterogeneous sensors (current, vibration, force and torque) placed at the robot tool level. The sensor measurements of the robot tool are processed, in an offline phase, to build health indicators and fused to learn a classifier for drifts detection and diagnostics. Then, during the online phase and in the case of presence of new drift patterns, the encoder measurements are used to label these patterns and update the classifier learned previously to diagnose their origin. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed methodology are verified through a real industrial machining multi-axis robot that investigates different drift severities of its arms. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2-s2.0-85122871025
"Temporal convolutional network with soft thresholding and attention mechanism for machinery prognostics Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is a challenging task for prognostics and health management (PHM). Due to the complexity physics involved for precisely modeling the machine degradation process, learning-based data-driven methods, which learn the degradation pattern solely from the historical data without referring to physical models, have become promising alternatives to model-based prognostic methods. In this paper, a new temporal convolutional neural network (TCN) with soft threshold and attention mechanism is proposed for machinery prognostics. Multi-channel sensor data are directly used as inputs to the prognostic network without feature extraction as a pre-processing step. A soft thresholding mechanism is embedded in the network, serving as a flexible activation function for certain layers to preserve useful features. The threshold value is adaptively learned by a subnetwork trained with the attention mechanism instead of assigning a deterministic value to the threshold. As a result, each feature map is assigned a customized threshold value such that the network training process can focus on features that are more critical to RUL prediction. To verify the generalization ability of the proposed method, three benchmark datasets related to rolling bearings and cutting tools are tested, and the performance of the developed method is compared with several state-of-the-art prognostic approaches. The results show that for all the three case studies, the developed method has produced accurate RUL prediction with good robustness and generalization ability. © 2021 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",2-s2.0-85110412090

"A dual-stream spatio-temporal fusion network with multi-sensor signals for remaining useful life prediction Extracting useful information from multi-sensor signals and accurately predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) remains a significant challenge. Traditional deep learning-based methods for predicting RUL focus on temporal correlations within signals from multiple sensors, often ignoring potential spatial correlations among the sensors. Recently, some methods integrating graph neural networks and time series models have been presented to extract both spatial and temporal correlations from multi-sensor signals. However, most of these integrated methods adopt sequential network structures, which may lead to degraded information loss during the information propagation process, thereby limiting prediction performance. To address these challenges, a dual-stream spatio-temporal fusion network (DS-STFN) for predicting RUL is proposed. Firstly, sensor monitoring data are transformed into grid-structured and graph-structured formats. Then, a temporal convolutional network, enhanced with an improved self-attention mechanism, is utilized to obtain temporal features from grid-structured data. In parallel, a graph transformer module is devised to capture spatial features from graph-structured data. Finally, temporal and spatial features are aggregated for feature fusion to predict RUL. The efficacy of DS-STFN for predicting RUL is verified using both the CMAPSS and tool wear datasets. The results indicate that the prediction performance of DS-STFN exceeds that of current state-of-the-art methods. © 2024 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",2-s2.0-85199347960
"Attitude data-based deep hybrid learning architecture for intelligent fault diagnosis of multi-joint industrial robots Monitoring the transmission status of multi-joint industrial robots is very important for the accuracy of the robot motion.

"A new model for maintenance prediction using altruistic dragonfly algorithm and support vector machine Predictive maintenance (PdM) is a proactive approach aimed at anticipating the future point of failure for a machine or a component, with the goal of reducing both the frequency and the expenses associated with unplanned downtime. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) techniques have enabled PdM to be more efficient with diverse and successful applications in various manufacturing industries. The support vector machine (SVM), a fundamental ML algorithm, is renowned for its effectiveness in addressing classification and regression tasks. Nevertheless, the successful application of SVM hinges on the careful tuning of its parameters, a process that significantly influences its predictive performance. This research seeks to optimize the selection of the regularization parameter C and the kernel parameter σ using metaheuristic methods. It suggests combining the altruistic dragonfly algorithm (ADA) with SVM to enhance the prediction of maintenance failures. The primary motive for integrating altruism into this research is the unprecedented utilization of altruistic principles within this specific area. In addition, ADA-SVM provides a balance between exploration and exploitation. This balance is achieved through the altruistic behavior of dragonflies, where they help each other find better solutions. Therefore, this model is not trapped in the local optimum. The effectiveness of the model ADA-SVM is assessed on aircraft engine sensor data in comparison with other metaheuristic optimization algorithms, namely, genetic algorithms (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), grey wolf optimization (GWO) and dragonfly algorithm (DA). The performance of the SVM has been improved significantly by using parameter optimization. Besides, while GA-SVM, PSO-SVM, and DA-SVM models were able to predict engine failures with 95% accuracy, and the GWO-SVM, which demonstrated a good performance in terms of accuracy compared to other metaheuristics algorithms, achieves an accuracy of 97%, the ADA-SVM reached the best accuracy value which is 98%. The findings, thus, reveal that the proposed model outperforms the other models in optimizing SVM parameters, and, therefore, improves the performance of the engines failures prediction.  © 2025 the author(s), published by De Gruyter.",2-s2.0-105001641116

"Multivariate Time-Series Classification of Critical Events from Industrial Drying Hopper Operations: A Deep Learning Approach In recent years, the advancement of Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing has made a large amount of industrial process data attainable with the use of sensors installed on machines. This paper proposes an experimental predictive maintenance framework for an industrial drying hopper so that it can detect any unusual event in the hopper, which reduces the risk of erroneous fault diagnosis in the manufacturing shop floor. The experimental framework uses Deep Learning (DL) algorithms to classify Multivariate Time-Series (MTS) data into two categories—failure or unusual events and regular events—thus formulating the problem as a binary classification. The raw data extracted from the sensors contained missing values, suffered from imbalancedness, and were not labeled. Therefore, necessary preprocessing is performed to make them usable for DL algorithms and the dataset is self-labeled after defining the two categories precisely. To tackle the imbalanced data issue, data balancing techniques like ensemble learning with undersampling and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) are used. Moreover, along with DL algorithms like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Machine Learning (ML) algorithms like Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) have also been used to perform a comparative analysis on the results obtained from these algorithms.

"High-Level Feature Fusion Deep Learning Model for Fault Detection in Handling Equipment in Dry Bulk Ports The flexibility of handling equipment in dry bulk ports is poor, and frequent equipment fault induced by the high-load and high-power working conditions greatly impacts the overall port handling operations, making accurate fault detection play an important role in improving the efficiency and stability of dry bulk port operations. However, as we know, most fault detection methods for port handling equipment depend heavily on monitoring sensor data, which is not applicable in the dry bulk port due to high configuration and maintenance cost, as well as the high false alarm rate of monitoring sensors caused by strong background noise. To solve the problem, this study proposes a High-Level Feature Fusion Deep Learning Model, which uses different deep learning sub-models to extract features of structured and unstructured data.

"Building a Trustworthy Product-Level Shape-Performance Integrated Digital Twin With Multifidelity Surrogate Model Digital twin has the potential for increasing production, achieving real-time monitor, and realizing predictive maintenance by establishing a real-time high-fidelity mapping between the physical entity and its digital model. However, the high accuracy and instantaneousness requirements of digital twins have hindered their applications in practical engineering. This article presents a universal framework to fulfill the requirements and to build an accurate and trustworthy digital twin by integrating numerical simulations, sensor data, multifidelity surrogate (MFS) models, and visualization techniques. In practical engineering, the number of sensors available to measure quantities of interest is often limited, and complementary simulations are necessary to compute these quantities. The simulation results are generally more comprehensive but not as accurate as the sensor data. Therefore, the proposed framework combines the benefits of both simulation results and sensor data by using an MFS model based on moving least squares (MLS), named MLS-based multifidelity surrogate (MFS-MLS). The MFS-MLS was developed as an essential part to calibrate the continuous field of the simulation by limited sensor data to obtain accurate results for the digital twin. Then, single-fidelity surrogate models are built on the whole domain using the calibrated results of the MFS-MLS as training samples and sensor data as inputs to predict and visualize the quantities of interest in real time. In addition, the framework was validated by a truss test case, and the results demonstrate that the proposed framework has the potential to be an effective tool to build accurate and trustworthy digital twins. © 2022 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

"Weak fault detection method of rolling bearing based on testing signal far away from fault source In some cases, because of the complex internal structure of the machines, the positions of the vibration sensors are far away from the rolling bearings, such as in an aeroengine, causing the fault features to become extremely weak, which brings great challenge to the detection of rolling bearings. To address this problem, an integrated detection method is proposed. First, a method named MEDL is proposed to determine the optimal filter length in minimum entropy deconvolution (MED) to enhance the periodic fault impulse component in the weak signal, which accuracy is 1. After that, the MEDL is combined with variational mode decomposition (VMD) and autocorrelation to extract fault features from strong background noise. A series of fault simulation experiments for rolling bearings were conducted by using an aeroengine rotor experimental rig with casing. The results verify that the accuracy of the integrated detection method is 100 % in different measuring points, speeds and fault types. At the same time, it compared with spectral kurtosis (SK) and empirical wavelet transform (EWT). It proves that the integrated detection method is more robust in extracting the weak fault characteristic of rolling bearings from the casing signals effectively. © 2020, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2-s2.0-85081004743

"First-principles calculations of adsorption sensitivity of Au-doped MoS2 gas sensor to main characteristic gases in oil Detecting oil-dissolved gases in transformer is crucial for internal discharge fault diagnosis. Methane (CH4), acetylene (C2H2), ethylene (C2H4), ethane (C2H6) are some of the important fault characteristic gases in oil-immersed transformer discharge faults. The concentration and production rate can effectively reflect the insulation performance of oil-paper power transformer. In order to realize the effective detection of gases in the oil, the Au atom-doped MoS2 (Au-MoS2) monolayer was proposed. To study adsorption properties of different gases, the density functional theory (DFT) was used to study applicability of Au-MoS2 two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials for gas sensor. Meanwhile, the adsorption properties, sensitivity and electronic behavior were calculated. The results show that the doped systems have a better sensing performance for C2H2, C2H4 and C2H6. And Au-MoS2 monolayer has a unique response to C2H2 with appropriate adsorption energy (− 1.056 eV) and charge transfer (0.252 e), which are far more than CH4 (− 0.065 eV, 0.037 e).

"Wireless body area network mutual trust analysis technique for fault detection using software defined network (SDN) Wireless Sensor Node (WSN) helps to track inpatient and remote patient (home/working) health information. Mishandling of the electronic system, patient behaviour and environmental changes which are all lead to incorrect data generation while using WSN for medical purposes. It leads to a false alarm being raised, network resource wastage, a false node priority level and low reliability.

"Sensor-aware CapsNet: Towards trustworthy multisensory fusion for remaining useful life prediction Multisensory data-driven remaining useful life (RUL) prediction based on deep learning techniques is gaining increasing popularity as it captures the degradation process of mechanical equipment more comprehensively, the prediction performance of which is generally higher. However, less emphasis has been placed on enhancing the trustworthiness of the model, especially in terms of reasonability and interpretability in uncertainty-aware prediction. Aiming to solve such a problem, a novel framework called a sensor-aware capsule neural network (SACN) is proposed for multisensory fusion in RUL prediction. Then a novel Monte Carlo-based dropout method based on the activation level of capsules was developed for uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, the proposed method allows for multisensory fusion interpretation to attribute prediction results and uncertainties to the relevant features across sensors. A case study on C-MAPSS dataset shows that the proposed method outperforms the popular deep learning-based methods. In particular, the SACN based on capsule dropout achieves both greater accuracy and better reasonability than Gaussian dropout, as evaluated by conventional accuracy metrics and the proposed uncertainty coverage score, and the relationship between input features and final results can be revealed through multisensory fusion interpretation, which evaluates the contributions of each sensor for the given input. © 2023 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",2-s2.0-85178358073
"A novel unsupervised graph wavelet autoencoder for mechanical system fault detection Reliable fault detection is an essential requirement for safe and efficient operation of mechanical systems in various industrial applications. As machine complexity increases, the number of sensors required to measure over time to infer abnormal and normal behavior increases dramatically, while despite the abundance of existing approaches and the maturity of fault detection research field, the interdependencies between the multivariate data have often been overlooked. However, current graph autoencoders for multivariate data mining have fixed receptive fields and ignores the distribution of latent space, limiting their ability to extract multiscale features and model performance. To overcome these limitations, a novel graph autoencoder, namely adversarially regularized graph wavelet autoencoder (ARGWAE), is proposed in this work. ARGWAE consists mainly of the spectral graph wavelet convolutional encoder for multivariate data multiscale feature extraction, a feature decoder for data reconstruction, and an adversarial regularizer to force the latent space match the Gaussian prior. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, two case studies are carried out and the experimental results show that the proposed method can obtain performance improvements by around 4–9% compared to the comparison methods.

"Fuzzy Fault Detection Observer Design for Unmanned Marine Vehicles Based on Membership-Function-Dependent H∞/H_ Performance This paper studies the design problem of fault detection (FD) observer for unmanned marine vehicles (UMVs) based on the T-S fuzzy model. Firstly, T-S fuzzy systems are used to approximate the nonlinear dynamics in UMVs. Secondly, to improve the FD performance of UMVs, a new (Formula presented.) performance index, which depends on the membership functions, is defined. Then, based on the membership-function-dependent (Formula presented.) performance index, a new fuzzy FD observer strategy, where the fuzzy submodels are not all required to be with the same (Formula presented.) performance index, is developed to detect the sensor fault in UMVs; the corresponding synthesis conditions of the FD observer are derived based on the Lyapunov theory. Different from the conventional FD strategies, in the proposed membership-function-dependent FD method, the fuzzy submodels—which the system always works on—can have a larger (Formula presented.) performance index, such that the performance of the FD can be improved.

"Time-Series Explanatory Fault Prediction Framework for Marine Main Engine Using Explainable Artificial Intelligence As engine monitoring data has become more complex with an increasing number of sensors, fault prediction based on artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged. Existing fault prediction models using AI significantly improve the accuracy of predictions by effectively handling such complex data, but at the same time, the problem arises that the AI-based models cannot explain the rationale of their predictions to users.

Therefore, it indicates which part of the data was significant for the fault prediction not only in terms of sensor type but also in terms of time.

This puts forward higher requirements for the accuracy of its fault-tolerant performance. The control system plays an increasingly important role in the rapid development of industrial production. When the sensor in the system fails, the system will become unstable. Therefore, it is necessary to accurately and quickly diagnose the faults of the system sensors and maintain the system in time.

To address this problem, this paper constructs an Anomaly Detection Method with Combined Data Imputation and Feature Collaboration (AD-CIFC), which firstly employs a comprehensive imputation strategy to impute the missing data in order to better adapt to the natural flow of time series and complex patterns; then two graph attention mechanisms are proposed to be used in parallel to capture the relationship between nodes more comprehensively by introducing synergies, thus effectively utilizing the correlation between features to make the model more sensitive; finally, two collaborative learning models are proposed to be used in parallel to more comprehensively take into account the strong correlation between features in the data, and a collaborative loss function computation method is proposed, thus improving the overall detection accuracy and discrimination ability. Through anomaly detection experiments on industrial robots with different levels of missing joint data, it is demonstrated that the AD-CIFC model demonstrates a performance that matches or even outperforms other mainstream anomaly detection models in complete fault data tests, while the model performance using the comprehensive imputation strategy to impute in the joints is about 25 % higher on average compared to the model performance of traditional linear interpolation methods, and meanwhile, in the case of missing data at the minor to severe levels, the model still demonstrates robustness beyond traditional methods, which is very suitable for industrial robot production lines. © 2024 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",2-s2.0-85196668766

"An integrated multiresolution framework for quality prediction and process monitoring in batch processes This article presents a new integrated multiresolution framework for quality prediction and process monitoring in complex batch operations: MR-QP&PM. For quality prediction, the proposed framework uses a multiresolution soft sensor that identifies the Critical to Quality (CTQ) variables and optimizes their resolution. This later tuning dimension has been overlooked in previous works and has a significant impact on the predictive accuracy of soft sensors, especially for batch processes. To complement the soft sensor and effectively assess the validity of its predictions and whether the process is operating under normal operating conditions (NOC), a monitoring scheme with multiresolution adaptability is applied. In case a fault is detected, MR-QP&PM is capable to discern whether the fault is CTQ and possibly estimate its impact.

"Development of Extractor-Classifier-Regulator integrated anomaly detection model for turning process Anomaly detection is important for safety and productivity in manufacturing systems. Together with the development in IoT, data-driven approach turns out as the most promising alternative for up-to-date anomaly detection. While applying modern A.I solutions into manufacturing for anomaly detection, however, it is often encountered that insufficient anomalous data is available for training deep-learning models. The most manufacturing systems are optimized to run at the best conditions so that anomalies rarely occur in the actual production lines. In this study, we proposed and developed an Extractor-Classifier-Regulator integrated anomaly detection model (ECR model) which combines the feature extractor, classifier and regulator in a block stacked way. This model requires the “normal” data only for training, and is capable of identifying the anomality based on the density of distribution in the extracted feature space. The framework described in the Section 2 yields that the ECR model is an end-to-end learning architecture, requires no pre-process for feature extraction and selection. The performance of the proposed model was first verified in the Section 3, by use of the phase-shifted sinusoidal waveforms generated artificially. The results suggested that our ECR model well yielded the degree of abnormality corresponding to the deviation of each variable from the “normal” datasets. The proposed model was then implemented into a turning process of Inconel 718 to detect cutting failure caused by tool wear. The experimental setup including machine tool, workpiece, tool holder, data acquisition system, time sequential signals related to the cutting process were detailed in the Section 4. After being trained by AE (Acoustic Emission) or sound signals captured in the “normal” cutting stage, the proposed model was able to derive anomaly scores which well matched with the cutting stages of “normal”, “transitional” and “anomalous” corresponding to the tool wear. © 2023 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",2-s2.0-85160814185
"A Data-Based Tool Failure Prevention Approach in Progressive Die Stamping The research on methods for monitoring sheet metal stamping is benefiting from the increased availability of enabling technologies such as sensors, data mining software, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. The predictive maintenance policies of tools (punches and dies) can be targeted at monitoring progressive wear or at the detection of sudden failures or anomalies. Early detection of tool failure is the method preferred by the recent literature on data management in sheet metal stamping. However, the stamping of small parts poses challenges due to multiple tools and signals and limited visibility of die wear, requiring management of multiple sensors and data sources.

"Data-model linkage prediction of tool remaining useful life based on deep feature fusion and Wiener process Accurately predicting the tool remaining useful life (RUL) is critical for maximizing tool utilization and saving machining costs. Various physical model-based or data-driven prediction methods have been developed and successfully applied in different machining operations. However, many uncertain factors affect tool RUL during the cutting process, making it challenging to create a precise physical model to characterize the degradation of tool performance. The success of the purely data-driven technique depends on the amount and quality of the training samples, it does not consider the physical law of tool wear, and the interpretability of the prediction results is poor. This paper presents a data-model linkage approach for tool RUL prediction based on deep feature fusion and Wiener process to address the above limitations. A convolutional stacked bidirectional long short-term memory network with time-space attention mechanism (CSBLSTM-TSAM) is developed in the data-driven module to fuse the multi-sensor signals collected during the cutting process and then obtain the mapping relationship between signal features and tool wear values. In the physical modeling module, a three-stage tool RUL prediction model based on the nonlinear Wiener process is established by considering the evolution law of different wear stages and multi-layer uncertainty, and the corresponding probability density function is derived. The real-time estimated tool wear of the data-driven module is used as the observed value of the physical model, and the model parameters are dynamically updated by the weight-optimized particle filter (WOPF) algorithm under a Bayesian framework, thereby realizing the data-model linkage tool RUL prediction.

"Synergistic effect of artificial intelligence and new real-time disassembly sensors: Overcoming limitations and expanding application scope With the acceleration of industrialization and the increase in the complexity of equipment, it is particularly important to accurately predict and effectively maintain equipment failures. In response to the problem of difficulty in accurately achieving predictive maintenance and the severely limited application range of new real-time disassembly sensors, this article conducts research on the synergistic effect of the new real-time disassembly sensors and artificial intelligence technology. First, relevant parameter data of a certain enterprise's generator can be collected on-site, and the Pearson correlation coefficient method can be used to calculate the correlation between the generator data parameters and the target fault type, ensuring the degree of correlation in extracting data features. Then, based on the gated recurrent unit (GRU) model, the article applied the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to optimize the parameters of the GRU network and used the support vector machine (SVM) model to optimize the classification function of the network output. Finally, the optimized GRU model can be applied to predict the fault types of generators, and based on this, it can be applied to the energy industry, agriculture, medical and health, and transportation industries to verify the application scalability of artificial intelligence and new real-time disassembly sensors. The experimental results show that the optimized GRU model combined with the new real-time disassembly sensor achieved an average accuracy of 0.94 in generator fault prediction, with a cost loss rate of only 3.03%, a decrease of 5.91% compared to the single new real-time disassembly sensor.

At the standpoint of workshop management, the current TCM has two drawbacks. (i) Continuously acquiring data without distinguishing the working states of the machine tool and the machining tasks will inevitably bring a large volume of unwanted signals, making difficulty for tool RUL prediction. (ii) The tool condition is independent of machining task, thus cannot provide further decision-making support for workshop scheduling and machining parameters optimization. Therefore, it is an important issue to consider various random events under the right machining tasks to trigger “monitoring” and RUL prediction just in time. This paper proposes an event-driven tool condition monitoring (EDTCM) methodology. The structure of EDTCM is designed based on the architecture of the Industrial Internet. Multi-source events are collected under the architecture, including MES events, machine tool events based on the OPC-UA (OPC Unified Architecture) standard, smart mobile terminal events, etc. The event-driven mode is designed to process these events such that the “monitoring” is triggered just in time. Then the Tool RUL is predicted online with the monitored sensor data based on the Bayesian method. A prototype system of EDTCM is developed and a case study is implemented to verify the feasibility of the proposed methodology. Our work promotes that the theories of TCM and tool RUL prediction deeply integrate with the real industrial practical applications. © 2020 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",2-s2.0-85097712348
"A case study of fault diagnosis based on deep autoencoder Unexpected failure of production equipment may lead to fatal accidents and economic losses of the enterprise. It is important to find out the cause and reason as soon as possible and take appropriate maintenance measures. Condition monitoring is often applied to predict equipment failures based on certain parameters. Moreover, when the parts of the rotating machinery fail, the vibration signals collected by the sensors are often mixed with a large amount of noise, which will cause difficulties for the accuracy and generalization of traditional fault diagnosis models. How to extract more effective feature information from complex vibration signals is of indescribable importance for optimizing fault diagnosis models. In order to improve the accuracy of fault diagnosis in manufacturing system, a deep neural network model was proposed, which was validated on a blower. First, the vibration signal was collected using the sensors mounted on the blower. Then, wavelet packet decomposition and fast fourier transform were applied for feature extraction. Deep learning model was built using keras to diagnose the blower. The stacked Autoencoder is adopted in the DNN for dimension reduction. The extracted features are fed into the Multilayer Perceptron for fault diagnosis. Experimental results show that the proposed deep neural network model is able to predict the degradation of the mechanical equipment with high accuracy. © 2023 - IOS Press.

"Remaining useful life prediction of milling cutters based on long-term data sequence and parallel fully convolutional feature learning Multi-sensor time-series signals demonstrate long-term dependence along the temporal dimension, and exhibit significant data distribution discrepancies between sensor channels. However, existing remaining useful life (RUL) prediction methods do not fully utilize this information. To solve this problem, a new deep feature learning network named parallel fully convolutional feature learning network (PFCFLN) is proposed in this paper for RUL prediction of milling cutters. In the proposed PFCFLN, multiple parallel fully convolutional subnets with different scales and layers are first employed to learn local features from long-term multi-sensor data sequences. Secondly, long-term dependence between local features is captured through the long-term attention mechanism, and local feature expression is enhanced through short-term attention and channel attention. Finally, the RUL of the milling cutter is predicted in the regression layer using attention-weighted features. In addition, a training method and an architecture search method are also presented to improve the practicality and prediction accuracy of the PFCFLN. To evaluate the proposed PFCFLN and related methods, multi-sensor data was collected from full-life testing of the milling cutter. Evaluation experiments were conducted on these data, and also compared with five advanced prediction methods. Experimental results proved the superiority of the proposed PFCFLN in improving milling cutter RUL prediction accuracy. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",2-s2.0-85198619360
"Unsupervised anomaly detection based on clustering methods and sensor data on a marine diesel engine Sensor data from marine engine systems can be used to detect changes in performance in near real time which may be indicative of an impending failure. Thus sensor-based condition monitoring can be important for the reliability of ship machinery systems and improve maritime safety. However, there is a need for efficient and robust algorithms to detect such changes in the data streams. In this paper, sensor data from a marine diesel engine on an ocean-going ship are used for anomaly detection. The focus is on unsupervised methods based on clustering and the idea is to identify clusters in sensor data in normal operating conditions and to assess whether new observations belong to any of these clusters. The anomaly detection methods presented in this paper are applied to sensor data with no known faults. Being fully unsupervised, however, they do not rely on the assumption that all measurements are fault free as long as the amount of faulty data is small. The methods explored in this study include K-means clustering, Mixture of Gaussian models, density-based clustering, self-organising maps and support vector machines. These could be used separately or in combination to provide an efficient initial screening of the data and decide whether more detailed analysis is required. The performance of the various methods is generally found to be good, also in comparison with other methods. Overall, cluster-based methods are found to be promising candidates for online anomaly detection and condition monitoring of ship machinery systems based on sensor data. © 2019 Institute of Marine Engineering, Science & Technology.",2-s2.0-85068174615

"Development of a speed invariant deep learning model with application to condition monitoring of rotating machinery The application of cutting-edge technologies such as AI, smart sensors, and IoT in factories is revolutionizing the manufacturing industry. This emerging trend, so called smart manufacturing, is a collection of various technologies that support decision-making in real-time in the presence of changing conditions in manufacturing activities; this may advance manufacturing competitiveness and sustainability. As a factory becomes highly automated, physical asset management comes to be a critical part of an operational life-cycle. Maintenance is one area where the collection of technologies may be applied to enhance operational reliability using a machine condition monitoring system. Data-driven models have been extensively applied to machine condition data to build a fault detection system. Most existing studies on fault detection were developed under a fixed set of operating conditions and tested with data obtained from that set of conditions. Therefore, variability in a model’s performance from data obtained from different operating settings is not well reported. There have been limited studies considering changing operational conditions in a data-driven model. For practical applications, a model must identify a targeted fault under variable operational conditions. With this in mind, the goal of this paper is to study invariance of model to changing speed via a deep learning method, which can detect a mechanical imbalance, i.e., targeted fault, under varying speed settings. To study the speed invariance, experimental data obtained from a motor test-bed are processed, and time-series data and time–frequency data are applied to long short-term memory and convolutional neural network, respectively, to evaluate their performance. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2-s2.0-85084462696
"A hybrid dynamic graph neural network framework for real-time anomaly detection The timely and robust detection of anomalies is essential for resilient and secure operations of critical water infrastructures against operational faults or malicious actions. However, real-world systems exhibit diverse and evolving spatiotemporal relationships among their components, posing an intricate challenge in anomaly detection. This study proposes a Hybrid Dynamic graph neural network that jointly maps long- and short-term spatiotemporal relationships in multivariate data streams. Those relationships are encoded via a hybrid graph, comprising an optimally learned static subgraph for persistent relationships and a complementary dynamic subgraph for dynamically shifting relationships. Additionally, an attention mechanism captures time-varying relational importances and shifts the model’s focus towards significant relationships, while minimising contributions of less importance to the final outputs. The proposed architecture is showcased through a synthetic case study of a water distribution system with multivariate data streams from both on-site and soft sensors, and shows strong detection and localisation accuracy against all scenarios of operational faults and malicious actions explored. A comparative analysis with an equivalent static graph model indicates that the addition of the hybrid dynamic component enhances detection accuracy and reduces false alarm rates through more robust characterisation of behaviours, thus allowing actionable insights for more resilient and secure operations. © 2024 The Authors.",2-s2.0-85215698277

"Data Fusion and Pattern Classification in Dynamical Systems Via Symbolic Time Series Analysis Symbolic time series analysis (STSA) plays an important role in the investigation of continuously evolving dynamical systems, where the capability to interpret the joint effects of multiple sensor signals is essential for adequate representation of the embedded knowledge. This technical brief develops and validates, by simulation, an STSA-based algorithm to make timely decisions on dynamical systems for information fusion and pattern classification from ensembles of multisensor time series data. In this context, one of the most commonly used methods has been neural networks (NN) in their various configurations; however, these NN-based methods may require large-volume data and prolonged computational time for training. An alternative feasible method is the STSA-based probabilistic finite state automata (PFSA), which has been shown in recent literature to require significantly less training data and to be much faster than NN for training and, to some extent, for testing. This technical brief reports a modification of the current PFSA methods to accommodate (possibly heterogeneous and not necessarily tightly synchronized) multisensor data fusion and (supervised learning-based) pattern classification in real-time. Efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated by fusion of time series of position and velocity sensor data, generated from a simulation model of the forced Duffing equation.

"Device Anomaly Detection Algorithm Based on Enhanced Long Short-Term Memory Network The problems in equipment fault detection include data dimension explosion, computational complexity, low detection accuracy, etc. To solve these problems, a device anomaly detection algorithm based on enhanced long short-term memory (LSTM) is proposed. The algorithm first reduces the dimensionality of the device sensor data by principal component analysis (PCA), extracts the strongly correlated variable data among the multidimensional sensor data with the lowest possible information loss, and then uses the enhanced stacked LSTM to predict the extracted temporal data, thus improving the accuracy of anomaly detection. To improve the efficiency of the anomaly detection, a genetic algorithm (GA) is used to adjust the magnitude of the enhancements made by the LSTM model. The validation of the actual data from the pumps shows that the algorithm has significantly improved the recall rate and the detection speed of device anomaly detection, with the recall rate of 97. 07%, which indicates that the algorithm is effective and efficient for device anomaly detection in the actual production environment. © 2023 Editorial Board of Journal of Dong Hua University.

"Joint evaluation and prediction of SOH and RUL for lithium batteries based on a GBLS booster multi-task model From the perspective of safe electric vehicle operation, accurately assessing the state of health (SOH) and remaining useful life (RUL) of lithium batteries holds paramount importance. This paper introduces a novel multi-task learning data-driven model named GBLS Booster, focusing on the joint estimation and prediction of SOH and RUL. GBLS Booster integrates the strengths of GBLS, offering reduced computation, swift computing speed, and harnesses the powerful feature extraction capabilities of the CNN-Transformers algorithm-based Booster. Additionally, the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) algorithm is applied to optimize the model. In this study, 10 healthy indicators (HIs) are devised to capture variations in battery SOH. These HIs are derived from readily available sensor data, encompassing current, voltage, and temperature information. The random forest method (RF) is employed to further refine features and minimize data dimensions. Concerning the RUL prediction, the capacity data is often plagued by significant noise. To address this challenge, the complete empirical mode decomposition (CEEMDAN) method is employed for noise reduction decomposition, followed by the utilization of the Pearson correlation coefficient to eliminate noisy data points. The proposed method is rigorously evaluated using the NASA dataset and CLACE dataset for modeling simulation and verification. Comparative analysis with other algorithms is conducted.

"A multi-fault diagnostic method based on category-reinforced domain adaptation network for series-connected battery packs For the intelligent development and safe operation of electric vehicles, it is really of critical importance to quickly detect and accurately distinguish different types of faults in battery packs. However, the fault characteristics of lithium-ion battery packs with different battery types and different health conditions are difficult to discriminate, and domain-adapted neural networks perform well in this regard. Based on this, a multi-fault detection method based on Category-Reinforced Domain Adaptation Network for series-connected battery packs was proposed by integrating the characteristics of Attentional Mechanisms and Domain Adaptation Neural Network, which can diagnose several types of faults (i.e. voltage imbalance, the internal short circuit, sensor faults, Sensor drift voltage, and Random fluctuation).

"A variational autoencoder for a semiconductor fault detection model robust to process drift due to incomplete maintenance In the semiconductor manufacturing field, few studies on fault detection (FD) models have considered process drift due to incomplete maintenance. Process drift refers to the shift in sensor measurements over time due to tool aging, and it leads to defective production when it is severe. Tool maintenance is conducted regularly to prevent defects. However, when it is performed improperly, tool aging accelerates, and the drift increases. In this paper, we propose an FD model robust to process drift by modeling process drift with a variational autoencoder (VAE). Because process drift is characterized by time-varying information, the proposed model encodes some time-varying information through separate hidden layers. By adopting a strategy that combines information separately encoded in a feature vector, the proposed model successfully models process drift. With actual chemical vapor deposition process data, we were able to generate many virtual datasets that incorporate process drift with various drift characteristics, such as patterns, degrees, and speeds. The proposed model outperformed four comparison FD methods on these datasets. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2-s2.0-85110508994

"Deep learning for machine health prognostics using Kernel-based feature transformation Prognostic health management minimizes system downtime and improves overall equipment effectiveness. Accurate prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) is key to prognostics. Prominent machine learning algorithms implement handcrafted feature extraction to improve RUL prediction. Deep learning automates feature extraction from raw data but requires large datasets and computationally expensive fine-tuning. Data-specific handcrafting and fine-tuning limit the generalization capability of existing models. Proposed framework addresses these challenges using Temporal Multivariate 3D Convolutional Network (TM3C) and Kernel-based Transformation (KT) of features. KT generates 3D features that incorporate trendable degradation patterns from multivariate temporal relationship among sensor data. TM3C implements 3D convolutional layers with temporal filters for RUL prediction. KT is generalizable and improves feature relevance. Full-width filters in TM3C reduce number of tunable parameters and convolution operations. Proposed TM3C-KT capitalizes on the strength of deep learning while lowering the cost for feature discovery, parameter learning, and model fine-tuning. TM3C-KT is evaluated on three prognostics applications, (1) RUL prediction for turbofan engines, (2) Failure state estimation for hydraulic pumps, and (3) Component wear prediction for milling machines. Performance of the framework is comparable and better than benchmark methods in literature. Characteristics of the framework are reviewed on generalizability, prognosability and versatility metrics.

"Estimating Remaining Useful Life of Turbofan Engine Using Data-Level Fusion and Feature-Level Fusion Degradation of systems is a natural and inevitable process which widely happens in industries. Therefore, prognostics is used to prevent unexpected failures of complex engineering systems by evaluating the health status of the system and estimating the remaining useful life, using multiple sensors that simultaneously monitor the degradation process of the system.

"Towards a smart workflow in CMMS/EAM systems: An approach based on ML and MCDM In the context of Industry 4.0, process automation and predictive maintenance play an essential role. There is a need to provide more effective and faster maintenance through the integration of industrial tools and processes, to support manufacturing operations, in the perspective of integration standards and architectures. In a typical maintenance system, registration and maintenance requests are made through maintenance orders, which consist of a standard form and usually are created and filled manually. However, predictive maintenance requires a higher level of automatization, from data acquisition to maintenance order generation in a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) / Enterprise Asset Management (EAM). The proposal is to automate the process of generating maintenance orders, providing for automated form completion. At the physical level, assets are monitored by sensors, and, based on a set of rules, the respective predictive maintenance order will be issued in CMMS/EAS. Maintenance orders may contain variable fields according to each asset, so Machine Learning (ML) and Multicriteria Decision Making (MCDM) will be applied to fill in these fields, as well as the allocation of the maintenance orders to the maintainer that best fit for the maintenance specification. This automatic process will assist the maintenance workflow, leading to a Smart Workflow concept. A serial and parallel framework are presented, the former consists in applying TOPSIS (MCDM method) to extract features for the use in ML classification, in order to automatically fill in the appropriate form fields. The latter consists in a classification using both methods (ML and MCDM), where TOPSIS performs the initial classification, and if the alternatives ranking scores are close to each other, ML is used for more accurate classification.

"Research on fault diagnosis of bearings in walking part of wall-building robot based on roadside acoustic signal The walking part of the wall-building robot is an important component whose health influences the robot's overall performance, and the bearing of the walking part is a critical but often disregarded component. As a result, based on acoustic signals from the roadside, this study proposes a method of bearing fault monitoring of walking parts to ensure the more stable operation of the wall-building robot. To begin, due to the Doppler effect caused by the relative displacement between the sensor and the walking part, the collected acoustic signal has frequency shift and amplitude attenuation, so the multiple signal classification spectrum estimation method with added windows is first used to determine the position and speed of the walking part bearing in real time, and then obtain a resampled time series of the distorted signal. Second, the distorted signal is resampled by Morse acoustic theory to correct the distorted sound signal collected by the array sensor. Third, a multitask deep learning method with an attention mechanism is designed to jointly diagnose the fault type and damage degree of bearing by analyzing the corrected acoustic signal. The experimental results show that the method can effectively restore the distorted signal while still accurately and stably detecting the fault type and damage degree of the bearing under a variety of working conditions and external disturbances, making it more suitable for the work of wall-building robots. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",2-s2.0-85139685417

"Hybrid Transformer for Anomaly Detection on Railway HVAC Systems Through Feature Ensemble of Spatial–Temporal with Multi-channel GADF Images The Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system, responsible for maintaining a comfortable indoor environment in buildings and vehicles, is designed to regulate factors such as temperature, humidity, and airflow. In transportation facilities, where HVAC systems are installed, they control and adjust the temperature, humidity, and intake of air within interior spaces, ensuring a pleasant environment, enhancing service quality, and safeguarding user health. However, these systems, which are both large-scale and highly complex, pose challenges when it comes to timely and effective problem-solving using a run-to-fail policy-based reactive maintenance approach. Therefore, there is a growing demand for deep learning models capable of HVAC fault detection to design preventive management using AI. These deep learning models typically receive input in the form of time-series data generated by various sensors in HVAC systems or images generated through transformation algorithms that intuitively represent time-series data. However, conventional deep learning models for analyzing these data types tend to focus on either temporal or spatial features. Hence, to utilize both temporal and spatial features simultaneously, we propose a transformer-based hybrid model. The proposed model leverages the Gramian Angular Difference Field algorithm, one of the image transformation algorithms, to convert multivariate time-series data from HVAC into multi-channel images. It then performs each second anomaly detection by combining feature information extracted through encoders from both transformer and vision transformer. In experimental datasets, the anomaly detection performance achieved an F1 score of 0.9965. As a result, this demonstrates that the proposed deep learning model can enhance the overall reliability and safety of HVAC systems, and showing that deep learning models can serve as crucial toolsin enhancing the maintenance and safety of HVAC systems. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers 2024.",2-s2.0-85186584477
"Transfer-Learning-Based Estimation of the Remaining Useful Life of Heterogeneous Bearing Types Using Low-Frequency Accelerometers Deep learning approaches are becoming increasingly important for the estimation of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of mechanical elements such as bearings. This paper proposes and evaluates a novel transfer learning-based approach for RUL estimations of different bearing types with small datasets and low sampling rates. The approach is based on an intermediate domain that abstracts features of the bearings based on their fault frequencies. The features are processed by convolutional layers. Finally, the RUL estimation is performed using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The transfer learning relies on a fixed-feature extraction. This novel deep learning approach successfully uses data of a low-frequency range, which is a precondition to use low-cost sensors. It is validated against the IEEE PHM 2012 Data Challenge, where it outperforms the winning approach. The results show its suitability for low-frequency sensor data and for efficient and effective transfer learning between different bearing types. © 2023 by the authors.",2-s2.0-85148685354
"Detection of internal short circuit in lithium-ion batteries based on electrothermal coupling model Internal short circuit (ISC) is the main cause of thermal runaway (TR) in lithium-ion batteries, and early detection of ISC is crucial to improve battery safety. This paper introduces a method for detecting ISC and classifying fault severity by analyzing the variations in voltage and surface temperature during battery operation. Firstly, the electrothermal coupling model (ETCM) of the battery was constructed, and the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) was used to identify the ISC of the battery through the real-time collected voltage and temperature sensor data When the battery was working. Then the battery model with ISC is updated by using equivalent ISC resistance. The battery status estimation is achieved by integrating the extended Kalman filter (EFK) and sliding mode observer (SMO). Finally, the fault grade is classified according to the state difference between the battery with ISC and normal battery. The batteries with different degrees of ISC were installed in battery packs and verified by the StarSim hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiment. The findings suggest that the proposed approach facilitates rapid identification of ISC in the battery pack and enables categorization of fault severity based on the state estimation outcomes derived from analyzing the battery with ISC. © 2024",2-s2.0-85210704842
"Online Fault Detection Configuration on Equipment Side of a Variable-Air-Volume Air Handling Unit With the development of the technology of the Internet of Things, more and more operational data can be collected from air conditioning systems. Unfortunately, the most of existing air conditioning controllers mainly provide controlling functions more than storing, processing or computing the measured data. This study develops an online fault detection configuration on the equipment side of air conditioning systems to realize these functions. Modbus communication is served to collect real-time operational data. The calculating programs are embedded to identify whether the measured signals exceed their limits or not, and to detect if sensor reading is frozen and other faults in relation to the operational performance are generated or not. The online fault detection configuration is tested on an actual variable-air-volume (VAV) air handling unit (AHU) .

"Gas Path Fault Diagnosis of Turboshaft Engine Based on Novel Transfer Learning Methods Data-driven fault diagnosis method is widely used in the field of engine health management, which uses engine sensor data as input and engine faulty components as output for component-level fault diagnosis of the engine. The application premise of the general data-driven fault diagnosis method is that all data come from the same working conditions, that is, they belong to the same distribution. However, this assumption is not valid in the actual engine fault diagnosis, because the engine state will change with the increase of running time. In the meantime, collecting engine data is usually expensive, time-consuming, and laborious. To solve these problems, extreme learning machine (ELM)-based two transfer learning methods for fault diagnosis of turboshaft engines are proposed in this paper. One is joint solving ELM (JSELM), which regards the information of the target domain and source domain as similar and different parts, respectively, and knowledge is extracted from them at the same time. The other is model transfer-based ELM (MTELM), which uses the idea of pretraining. First, a general ELM classifier is trained with the source domain data and then fine-tuned with the target domain data. Both methods have a good real-time performance as the traditional ELM. When there are a few data in the target domain, they achieve much better classification accuracy than traditional ELM. Finally, experiments are carried out with turboshaft engine simulation data. The results show that both methods are effective, especially MTELM, which has better classification accuracy. Copyright VC 2024 by ASME.",2-s2.0-85188194550

It paves the path for integrated industrial data analysis by combining IoT and Artificial Intelligence for better data interpretation. At present in oil industry, pipelines prevail to be feasible mode, the risk probability rate is getting increased and maintenance system becomes difficult with attention to the earlier prediction of accidents risks by undertaking entire pipeline.

"Few-shot classification for sensor anomalies with limited samples Structural health monitoring (SHM) systems generate a large amount of sensing data. Data anomalies may occur due to sensor faults and extreme events. Sensor faults can result in low-fidelity measurement data, while data associated with extreme events are crucial for assessing the structural safety condition and should be given special attention. Accurate detection and classification of anomalies can improve the performance of SHM systems. However, most existing classification methods work well only when the number of a-single-class anomalies is sufficient. This study proposes an automatic few-shot classification method for sensor anomalies with limited labeled samples. The most discriminatory shapelet, a new representation of abnormal data, is learned from the standard normal class by maximizing the overall distance, which can locate the prominent abnormal features from 1-h acceleration data. The classification is then learned based on manual feature extraction and deep-learning-based feature extraction by measuring the similarity between the most discriminatory shapelets from the query and support sets. The proposed few-shot classification method is applied to datasets collected from two SHM systems of a long-span bridge and a campus footbridge. Results demonstrate that the proposed method can classify new anomalies with limited samples that differ from the defined anomalies. © 2024 The Authors",2-s2.0-85188533590

"Condition Monitoring of Wind Turbine Drivetrain Bearings As an extremely valuable and reliable energy source, the renewable energy is developing around the world at an unprecedented pace. By the end of 2022, the global installed capacity of offshore wind turbines is expected to reach 46.4 GW, among which 33.9 GW in Europe. Efficiencies in Operations and Maintenance (O&M) offer potential to achieve significant cost savings as it accounts for around 20%-30% of overall offshore wind farm costs. A recent study of approximately 350 offshore wind turbines indicates that gearboxes might have to be replaced as early as 6.5 years. Therefore sensing and condition monitoring (CM) systems are needed in order to obtain reliable information on the state and condition of different critical parts. The development and use of such technologies will allow companies to schedule actions at the right time. The reduced costs of O&M enable the wind energy at a competitive price thus strengthening productivity of the wind energy sector. At the academic level, a plethora of methodologies have been proposed during the last decades focusing toward early and accurate fault detection. Among others, Envelope Analysis is one of the most important methodologies, where the envelope of the vibration signal is estimated, usually after filtering around a selected frequency band excited by impacts due to the faults. Different tools, such as Kurtogram, have been proposed in order to accurately select the optimum filter parameters (center frequency and bandwidth). Cyclostationary analysis and corresponding methodologies, i.e., the cyclic spectral correlation and the cyclic spectral coherence, have been proved as powerful tools for CM. On the other hand the application, test, and evaluation of such tools in general industrial cases is still rather limited. Therefore the main aim of this paper is the application and evaluation of advanced diagnostic techniques and diagnostic indicators, including the Enhanced Envelope Spectrum and the Spectral Flatness on real-world vibration data collected from vibration sensors on gearboxes in multiple wind turbines over an extended period of time of nearly four years. The diagnostic indicators are compared with classical statistic time and frequency indicators, i.e., Kurtosis, Crest Factor, etc. and their effectiveness is evaluated based on the successful detection of two failure events.

"Discrete Fault Diagnosis of Structurally Reconfigurable Systems Fault diagnosis of a certain class of hybrid systems referred to as structurally reconfigurable (SR) systems is complicated. This is because SR systems tend to switch their configuration, which may or may not be faulty. It is important to identify the mode of the SR system along with the corresponding fault if any, in order to facilitate a fault tolerant action. This paper combines discrete fault diagnosis with mode identification for SR systems to achieve two main objectives: Sensor selection for fault detection, isolation and mode identification, and residual selection for mode identification. The framework is built using a structural analysis-based approach to meet these objectives. This framework is demonstrated for a 10-speed Automatic Transmission, which is an illustrative example of SR systems. Copyright © 2021 by ASME",2-s2.0-85126610725
"Fault detection in a three-tank hydraulic system using unknown input observer and extended Kalman filter This paper presents the problem of fault diagnosis in a three-tank hydraulic system. A mathematical model of the system is developed in order to apply two different observing algorithms. Unknown Input Observer (UIO) and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) have been used to detect and isolate actuator and sensor faults. For Unknown Input Observer (UIO), residuals are calculated from the measured and estimated output according to the eigenvalues of the system after processed by Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI). Extended Kalman filter uses process and measurement noise variances for state estimation. Unknown Input Observer and Extended Kalman Filter's performance in fault estimation and isolation is evaluated under different scenarios. Using Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), faults can be diagnosed effectively in the presence of noise, while Unknown Input Observer (UIO) is working better in the absence of noise, and simulation results illustrate that clearly. © 2021 University of Kuwait.

"Enhanced Fault Diagnosis in Electric Drive Systems Utilizing an Optimal Band Extraction Method for Low-Quality Signals The acceleration vibration signals acquired by the Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) sensor may be vulnerable to noise and interference due to the integration requirements of the Electric Drive System (EDS). A new fault feature frequency band extraction process, named Particle Swarm Optimization-Spectral Gini Index (PSO-SGI), was proposed. The spectral Gini index (SGI) was utilized as the fitness function in an iterative optimization process to ascertain the center frequency of the optimal frequency band. The simulation signals demonstrate a comparative analysis of multiple indicators to characterize the features of bearing faults and assess the influence of bandwidth. A bench test of EDS with bearing fault was designed, and vibration signals were collected by both Integrated Electronics Piezo-Electric (IEPE) and MEMS sensors.

"Fault detection in Tennessee Eastman process with temporal deep learning models Automated early process fault detection and prediction remains a challenging problem in industrial processes. Traditionally it has been done by multivariate statistical analysis of sensor readings and, more recently, with the help of machine learning methods. The quality of machine learning models strongly depends on feature engineering, that in turn heavily relies on expertise of the process engineers and model developers. With the recent advent of deep learning neural network methods and abundance of available sensor data, it became possible to develop advanced approaches to early fault detection and prediction that do not require feature engineering and provide more accurate and timely results. In this paper we investigate a wide range of recurrent and convolutional architectures on the publicly available simulated Tennessee Eastman Process extended TEP dataset for the fault detection in chemical processes.

"Development and Validation of a General and Robust Methodology for the Detection and Classification of Gas Turbine Sensor Faults Sensor fault detection and classification is a key challenge for machine monitoring and diagnostics, since raw data cleaning represents a key process in the gas turbine industry. To this end, this paper presents a comprehensive approach for detection, classification, and integrated diagnostics of gas turbine sensors (named DCIDS), which was previously developed by the authors and has been substantially improved and validated by means of field data. For a single sensor or redundant/correlated sensors, the improved diagnostic tool, called improved-DCIDS (I-DCIDS), can identify seven classes of faults, i.e., out of range, stuck signal, dithering, standard deviation, trend coherence, spike, and bias. First, this paper details the I-DCIDS methodology for sensor fault detection and classification. The methodology uses basic mathematical laws that require some user-defined configuration parameters, i.e., acceptability thresholds and windows of observation. Second, a sensitivity analysis is carried out on I-DCIDS parameters to derive some rules of thumb about their optimal setting. The sensitivity analysis is performed on four heterogeneous and challenging datasets with redundant sensors acquired from Siemens gas turbines (GTs). The results demonstrate the diagnostic capability of the I-DCIDS approach in a real-world scenario. Moreover, the methodology proves to be suitable for all types of datasets and physical quantities and, thanks to its optimal tuning, can also identify the exact time point of fault onset. © 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

"SOC estimation and fault diagnosis framework of battery based on multi-model fusion modeling Accurate estimation of the battery state characteristics can ensure the safe driving of electric vehicles(EVs). This paper aims to propose a new method for state of charge (SOC) estimation and fault diagnosis based on multiple equivalent circuit models(ECMs) fusion approach. This paper improves the accuracy of SOC estimation and fault diagnosis from the following four aspects. Firstly, the Thevenin model and second-order ECM are selected to describe the dynamic characteristics of the battery and the least square method is then used to determine the model parameters. Besides, the unscented Kalman filter(UKF) is employed to estimate the SOC from the two models and the Bayesian theorem is employed to determine the optimal weights for synthesizing the SOCs estimated from the two models. Moreover, the voltage residual innovation sequence(RIS) is introduced to adaptively adjust the size of the window width in real-time, which can promote the iterative performance of traditional UKF and the prediction ability of the models. Finally, an adaptive fault diagnosis framework based on multiple ECMs fusion is constructed to determine the current battery operation status based on the probability weight of each model, and also to achieve accurate early warning of the current sensor fault. The experimental results show that the SOC estimation errors are controlled within 1 %, and the battery status and current sensor fault can also be accurately diagnosed. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85152393659
"An early detection and location method for internal short circuit faults in series-connected lithium-ion battery packs Internal short circuit (ISC) is the main cause of thermal runaway in battery packs. The subtle early characteristics of ISC lead to high detection delay, low diagnostic efficiency, and inaccurate fault isolation/location, which hinder the practical application of statistical methods. To address these issues, a rapid and accurate diagnosis scheme based on recursive correlation coefficient (RCC) and kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) is proposed. Where RCC is used to extract the synchronization of voltage variations as an early fault signature while suppressing cell inconsistency; and KPCA is used to model all high-dimensional nonlinear RCCs in parallel. In particular, the kernel sample equivalent replacement technique is utilized to represent the detection statistic as a standard quadratic form of RCCs, which significantly reduces the complexity of the diagnosis algorithm. On this basis, to eliminate the smearing effect, a variable reconstruction-based fault isolation algorithm is employed to directly isolate faulty RCCs without calculating specific contributions. Finally, the faulty cell can be accurately located based on the sensor topology. The results on a real battery pack test platform show that the proposed method provides a significant improvement in fault detection delay and diagnosis efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art methods, and the isolation/location accuracy is increased to more than 90%. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85212580873

"Lithium Battery Remaining Useful Life Prediction Based on Multi-Kernel Support Vector Regression With Hybrid Optimization Algorithm Accurately and reliably predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of lithium battery is very important for the lithium battery health management system. However, most of the existing methods rely on complex multidimensional input features, which require a large number of sensors, increase the application cost and introduce redundant measurement errors. Therefore, this paper, only based on the battery capacity curve itself, proposes a method to construct a prediction model of support vector regression (SVR) by fusing multiple kernel functions. The linear equation coefficients of multiple kernel function combinations are optimized by the hybrid optimization algorithm. It is found that the hybrid kernel function can effectively overcome the problem that the single-kernel function is not capable of mapping the capacity fading trend of lithium battery. Hybrid optimization algorithm can avoid the problems of local optimization and global search ability deficiency. The proposed method is validated by experiments using the battery attenuation datasets from NASA, the University of Maryland, and a high-rate lithium battery in the laboratory stage. It can be seen from the experimental results that the prediction accuracy of this method is high. The mean prediction error, mean RMSE, and mean MAE are 2%, 0.0198, and 0.0157.

"Prediction of Gas Turbine Trip: A Novel Methodology Based on Random Forest Models A gas turbine trip is an unplanned shutdown, of which the most relevant consequences are business interruption and a reduction of equipment remaining useful life. Thus, understanding the underlying causes of gas turbine trip would allow predicting its occurrence in order to maximize gas turbine profitability and improve its availability. In the ever competitive Oil & Gas sector, data mining and machine learning are increasingly being employed to support a deeper insight and improved operation of gas turbines.

This paper presents a novel methodology aimed at exploiting information embedded in the data and develops random forest models, aimed at predicting gas turbine trip based on information gathered during a timeframe of historical data acquired from multiple sensors. The novel approach exploits time series segmentation to increase the amount of training data, thus reducing overfitting. First, data are transformed according to a feature engineering methodology developed in a separate work by the same authors. Then, Random Forest models are trained and tested on unseen observations to demonstrate the benefits of the novel approach.

"Air-Fuel Ratio Imbalance Diagnostic of Spark-Ignited Engines with Modulated Sliding Discrete Fourier Transform This paper presents the novel on-board air-fuel ratio (AFR) imbalance diagnostic of spark-ignited (SI) engines. Because of the reciprocating nature of internal combustion engines, while this fault is present, it is known that the exhaust gas oxygen (EGO) sensor signal is accompanied by the oscillating disturbance of which frequency depends on the engine speed, such that it can be represented by the superposition of multiharmonic and DC signals. Motivated from this inherent feature, the novel diagnostic for detection and location of AFR imbalance is developed with modulated sliding discrete Fourier transform (mSDFT) and angular domain sampling. The feasibility is demonstrated with the simulated and measured AFR signals. It turns out that the developed diagnostic is able to identify fault types such as lean or rich imbalance and locate a single cylinder or multiple cylinders having abnormal AFR. It is robust to measurement noise at the expense of slow convergence rate. Spectral leakage is reduced with crank domain sampling such that accuracy in spectral analysis is improved.

"Comparison of Blind Diagnostic Indicators for Condition Monitoring of Wind Turbine Gearbox Bearings Under the pressure of climate change, renewable energy gradually replaces fossil fuels and plays nowadays a significant role in energy production. Among different types of energy sources, wind power covered 14% of the EU’s electricity demand in 2018. The Operations and Maintenance (O&M) costs of wind turbines may easily reach up to 20–25% of the total leverised cost per kWh produced over the lifetime of the turbine for a new unit. According to Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables onshore wind farm operators are expected to spend nearly $15 billion on O&M services in 2019. Manufacturers and operators try to reduce O&M on one hand by developing new turbine designs and on the other hand by adopting condition monitoring approaches. One of the most critical and rather complex assemblies of wind turbines is the gearbox. Gearboxes are designed to last till the end of asset’s lifetime, according to the IEC 61400-4 standards. On the other hand, a recent study over approximately 350 offshore wind turbines indicated that gearboxes might have to be replaced as early as 6.5 years. Therefore a plethora of sensor types and signal processing methodologies have been proposed in order to accurately detect and diagnose the presence of a fault. Among others, envelope analysis is one of the most important methodologies, where an envelope of the vibration signal is estimated, usually after filtering around a selected frequency band excited by impacts due to the fault. Sometimes the gearbox is equipped with many acceleration sensors and its kinematics is clearly known. In these cases cyclostationary analysis and the corresponding methodologies, i.e., the cyclic spectral correlation and the cyclic spectral coherence, have been proposed as powerful tools. On the other hand often the gearbox is equipped with a limited number of sensors and a simple global diagnostic indicator is demanded, being capable to detect globally various faults of different components. The scope of this paper is the application and comparison of a number of blind global diagnostic indicators which are based on Entropy (permutation entropy, approximate entropy, samples entropy, fuzzy entropy, conditional entropy, and Wiener entropy), on Negentropy (Infogram), on Sparsity (Sparse-L2/L1, Sparse-L1/L0, and Sparse-Gini index) and on Statistics (mean, standard deviation, kurtosis, etc.). The performance of the indicators is evaluated and compared on a wind turbine dataset, consisted of vibration data captured by one accelerometer mounted on six 2.5 MW wind turbines, located in a wind park in northern Sweden, where two different bearing faults have been filed, for one wind turbine, during a period of 46 months. Among the different diagnostic indicators permutation entropy, approximate entropy, samples entropy, fuzzy entropy, conditional entropy, and Wiener entropy achieve the best results detecting blindly the two failure events.

"Predictive Maintenance of Stormwater Infrastructure Using Internet-of-Things Technology Operations and maintenance (O&M) practices are becoming increasingly scrutinized as storm events become more frequent and intense, surpassing the design storms that dictated the original capacity. In order to get the best performance from infrastructure investments, communities are looking to establish effective operations and maintenance programs.

The degradation in performance of stormwater systems was progressively monitored using indicators for probability and consequence of failure. Failure in this context is a stormwater facility's vulnerability to meet the design performance due to decreased capacity. Probability of failure was rated using a hydrologic model calibration statistic to assess the difference between the observed data set and a drawdown model. Consequence of failure was rated by evaluating the duration of drawdown periods based on regional regulatory criteria and operator schedules.

"Attention mechanism-based multisensor data fusion neural network for fault diagnosis of autonomous underwater vehicles The autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) frequently operates in harsh underwater environments, and timely fault diagnosis of the AUV can prevent mission failure and equipment loss. Data-driven methods based on a single data source have been widely utilized for fault diagnosis of the AUV because they do not require the construction of complex mechanism models and have high fault diagnosis accuracy. However, these methods face challenges in accomplishing complex fault diagnosis tasks because the single data source provides very restricted fault features. To address this issue, an attention mechanism-based multisensor data fusion neural network (MDFNN) for AUV fault diagnosis is proposed in this work. First, a feature extraction layer based on the two-dimensional (2D) convolutional method with a 1D kernel is introduced to extract features from each sensor data separately, significantly optimizing the model architecture. Second, an efficient channel attention mechanism-based feature fusion layer is proposed to reassign weights to the features of each sensor data, enabling the model to focus more on crucial features. Finally, the fused features are input to the fully connected layers and softmax layer to realize the fault diagnosis of multisensor data. In the end, the diagnostic performance of the proposed MDFNN is evaluated utilizing real AUV experimental data. The experiment shows that the proposed MDFNN has a very fast convergence speed and 98.37% fault diagnosis accuracy, demonstrating its excellent fault diagnosis performance. The proposed MDFNN provides a generalized and simply structured fault diagnosis framework for the AUV with multiple types of sensor data, providing significant engineering value. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",2-s2.0-85177554493
"Classification-Based Fuel Injection Fault Detection of a Trainset Diesel Engine Using Vibration Signature Analysis Diesel engines are crucial components of trainsets. Automated fault detection of diesel engines can play an important role for increasing reliability of passenger trains. In this research, vibration-based fuel injection fault detection of a high-power 12-cylinder trainset diesel engine is studied. Vibration signals are analyzed in frequency and time-frequency domains to obtain possible patterns of faults. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) and wavelet packet transform (WPT) of vibration signals are used to extract several uncorrelated features. These features are chosen to increase the ability of classifiers to separate healthy and faulty engine sides, automatically. Different classification methods including multilayer perception (MLP), support vector machines (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and local linear model tree (LOLIMOT) are used to process captured features; these methods are utilized in both ""Single-sensor condition monitoring"" and ""Classification and fault detection"" sections. It is shown that KNN networks are practical tools in the proposed fault detection procedure. The main novelty of this work comes from introducing a rich feature-extraction method based on a combination of FFT and db4 features. In addition, the complexity of computations and average running-time decrease while classification accuracy in the fuel injection fault detection procedure increases. © 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

"A novel sequential estimation framework for battery state of health and remaining useful life based on sparse and limited data Battery State of Health (SOH) estimation and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction are significant for battery management systems in both electric vehicles and energy storage systems. Various battery Health Indicators (HIs) and abundant health information are generally utilized for SOH and RUL estimation. However, HIs and health information may not be available for various reasons such as sensor installation limitations, computational burden and communication delay of the system. To overcome the issue of sparse and limited data acquisition in real applications, this study proposed a novel battery SOH and RUL sequential estimation framework only utilizing sparse segments of time series voltage data. The Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network are applied for SOH estimation and RUL prediction respectively. Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing (LOWESS) is used for both data smoothing and sparse data reconstruction. Three common battery datasets are fully investigated for validation. The experiment results show well estimation accuracies in both battery SOH and RUL, demonstrating the effectiveness of the framework in limited data prediction. Several popular SOH and RUL estimation algorithms and two state-of-the-art works are compared to further elaborate the superiority of the proposed framework. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85201713628
"Voltage sensor fault detection, isolation and estimation for lithium-ion battery used in electric vehicles via a simple and practical method Accurate measurement information, especially precise voltage, is essential for model-based multi-state estimation algorithms of lithium-ion battery. Regarding the shortcomings in existing diagnosis methods, such as the difficulty in threshold value determination, low voltage sensor fault detection efficiency and the assumption of no multiple faults occur simultaneously, a simple and practical voltage sensor fault detection, isolation and estimation method is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the widely used algorithm by fusion of recursive least square and extend Kalman filter is adopted to obtain the measurement innovation (MI) between measured and estimated terminal voltage during online state-of-charge estimation process. Subsequently, focusing on the MI generated under faultless and faulty voltage sensors, a simple feature point (FP) identification-based voltage sensor detection and isolation method is further designed. Finally, with the identified FP's y-coordinate, a three-step based voltage sensor fault estimation method is developed to determine the fault mode and the corresponding fault value. Moreover, the proposed voltage sensor fault diagnosis method is verified by Federal Urban Driving Schedule test, whose results demonstrate that it can still realize immediate voltage sensor fault detection (at the moment of sensor fault occurrence) and accurate voltage sensor fault estimation even though there exist certain current sensor fault. © 2022",2-s2.0-85137103154
"A lithium-ion battery health state assessment and remaining useful life prediction method based on multi slope features In the field of battery management, accurately predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of lithium-ion batteries is critical to safeguard the safety of batteries and devices. However, current prediction methods are mainly based on sensor data such as battery voltage, current, temperature, time, and other data, and there is a challenge problem with neglecting the intrinsic connection between these data. To address this problem, a lithium-ion battery health state assessment and remaining useful life prediction method based on multi slope features of discharge curves is proposed. First, new slope features of discharge curve are proposed based on the discharge mechanism of lithium-ion batteries; second, slope features are utilized to estimate the state of health (SOH) of the batteries; then, unsupervised clustering is performed on the unlabeled SOH data to construct a health state assessment model; and finally, the RUL prediction model based on the gated recurrent unit with grey wolf optimizer (GWO-GRU) is constructed.

"Vision-based Dynamics Monitoring (VDM) for Diagnosing the Variations of Wind Turbine Tower Foundation Conditions A slight uneven settlement of the foundation may cause the wind turbine to shake, tilt, or even collapse, so it is increasingly necessary to realize remote condition monitoring of the foundations. At present, the wind turbine foundation monitoring system is incomplete. The current monitoring research of the tower foundation is mainly of contact measurements, using acceleration sensors and static-level sensors for monitoring multiple reference points. Such monitoring methods will face some disadvantages, such as the complexity of monitoring deployment, the cost of manpower, and the load effect on the tower structure. To solve above issues, this paper aims to investigate wind turbine tower foundation variation dynamic monitoring based on machine vision.

"A flexible alarm prediction system for smart manufacturing scenarios following a forecaster–analyzer approach The introduction of data-related information technologies in manufacturing allows to capture large volumes of data from the sensors monitoring the production processes and different alarms associated to them. An early prediction of those alarms can bring several benefits to manufacturing companies such as predictive maintenance of the equipment, or production optimization. This paper introduces a new system that allows to anticipate the activation of several alarms and thus, warns the operators in the plants about situations that could hamper the machines operation or stop the production process. The system follows a two-stage forecaster–analyzer approach on which first, a long short-term memory recurrent neural network based forecaster predicts the future sensor’s measurements and then, distinct analyzers based on residual neural networks determine whether the predicted measurements will trigger an alarm or not. The system supports some features that make it particularly suitable for smart manufacturing scenarios: on the one hand, the forecaster is able to predict the future measurements of different types of time-series data captured by various sensors in non-stationary environments with dynamically changing processes. On the other hand, the analyzers are able to detect alarms that can be modeled with simple rules based on the activation condition, and also more complex alarms on which it is unknown when the activation condition will be fulfilled. Moreover, the followed approach for building the system makes it flexible and extensible for other predictive analysis tasks. The system has shown a great performance to predict three different types of alarms. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2-s2.0-85088100116
"Predicting battery degradation profiles of IoT device usage modes through Machine Learning utilization models IoT-enabled devices powered by rechargeable batteries often need to be compact, which results in using low-capacity batteries that require frequent charging. The high cycle count leads to noticeable battery health degradation. Therefore, understanding how different usage modes of IoT devices affect the State of Health (SoH) of the battery is crucial. Energy consumption and battery degradation vary significantly across usage modes, making it important to identify the specific impact each mode has on the battery health. Traditional lab-based testing is often time-consuming, costly, and may not accurately reflect real-world usage patterns. This paper introduces a systematic procedure that leverages established Machine Learning (ML) utilization models to reveal degradation profiles associated with various usage modes of IoT devices and their impact on battery health. These degradation profiles illustrate how the runtime in a given usage mode influences the SoH of a battery. This insight allows product developers to optimize existing usage modes and improve the efficiency of next-generation IoT products. Additionally, these degradation profiles enable accurate predictions of the battery's Remaining useful Lifetime (RuL) by providing a measure for the decrease in SoH based on the runtime of a specific usage mode. © 2024 The Author(s)",2-s2.0-85213270654
"Fault detection of lithium-ion battery packs with a graph-based method A fast fault detection of lithium-ion battery (LiB) packs is critically important for electronic vehicles. In previous literatures, an interleaved voltage measurement topology is commonly used to collect working voltage of each cell in LiB packs. However, previous studies ignore the structure information of voltage sensor layout, leading to a large time delay for LiB fault detection. To tackle the above issue, this work proposes a graph-based autoencoder, which uses graph data of voltage sensors to strengthen the reconstruction ability of the traditional autoencoder, and combines the voltage reconstruction errors with a specific detection strategy to identify three common fault types and their locations in LiB packs. Our results obtain the mean AUC of more than 88% for all three fault types and the mean relative detection time of 1.5 s, 11 s and 0.1 s for three fault types, respectively, which perform better than state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, identification of mixed faults is also performed to validate the proposed method, and the results reveal that the proposed method is reliable and fast for fault detection of LiB packs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85121653060
"Optimizing fault detection in battery energy storage systems through data-driven modeling In this paper, we propose an enhanced hybrid machine learning model for real-time fault identification in the sensors of these Battery Energy Storage System (BESS). Early and precise fault recognition is necessary to preserve the functionality of a BESS. Conventional approaches have often used manual inspection or simple threshold-based techniques, which may be inadequate at detecting complex faults. Our data-driven approach addresses these limitations by leveraging an improved Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based clustering learning algorithm with a corrected reconstruction technique to detect multiple faults in the system. The faults detected are refined with signal to noise ratio analysis and then verified using the spectral residuals algorithm. The model has been tested using data from nearly 9500 actual sensors that measure a variety of physical quantities, including voltage, current, and temperature, in a BESS installed in a 28.2-megawatt solar photovoltaic cell power plant on Kauai Island in Hawaii. Our results show that our model has an 83% fault detection rate and 88% detection accuracy, significantly outperforming manual inspection methods. In addition, the approach we propose can detect faults with a 25% increase in detection range compared to simpler methods.

"Optimizing fault diagnosis for electric vehicle battery systems: Improved Giza pyramids construction and advanced gradient boosting decision trees This manuscript proposes an online multi-fault diagnostic technique for the series string batteries in electric vehicles to identify and diagnose external/internal short circuits, sensor faults, and connection fault detection. The proposed technique combines the Improved Giza Pyramids Construction and Gradient Boosting Decision Trees. Many variables, including road conditions, electromagnetic interference, and driving habits, may complicate the battery fault system, multi-parameter or non-linear coupling, making it challenging to diagnose faults properly by using a single parameter in the real operation of an electric vehicle. The voltage fluctuation data is collected by simulating a battery discharging and charging investigation in a vibration setting. By deconstructing and rebuilding the discrete wavelet transform, the proposed approach removes voltage signal noise. To categorize the fault state, the voltage change, co-variance and variance matrixes, and voltage characteristics are employed as input-values in the improved Giza pyramids construction, and gradient boosting decision trees technique. The Improved Giza pyramids construction technique is utilized to detect fault signals and determine the degree of the defect. The cell faults are separated from other faults using the Gradient Boosting Decision Trees approach by identifying the surrounding voltages with fault flags. Furthermore, the correlation coefficient of the nearby voltage difference and current isolates connection and voltage sensor defects. The multi-fault diagnosis approach may prevent erroneous fault detection and offer high resilience to battery inconsistencies and normal measurement errors of state of health, ambient temperature, and state of charge. The projected control theme is evaluated on the MATLAB platform and its performance is assessed.

"Infrared and visible image fusion method based on hierarchical attention mechanism Currently, most feature extraction methods lack generality and require specific feature extraction methods for images from different sensors, particularly in the detection of faults in power equipment. However, the challenge lies in how to restore realistic texture details while correcting the color distortion. To address this issue, we propose an innovative infrared-visible light image fusion technique that combines hierarchical attention modules and collaborative refinement modules to facilitate feature fusion by jointly preserving intricate details and correcting lighting conditions. The hierarchical attention module aims to provide two different attention weight maps, which help select the most salient information from the source images in the infrared and visible light domains. This ultimately produces intermediate fusion results with comprehensive and complementary data. The collaborative refinement module consists of an edge enhancement network and a lighting correction network, which works together to enhance edge details and correct color differences. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of this method in successfully fusing the two types of images.

"Self-attention Mechanism Network Integrating Spatio-Temporal Feature Extraction for Remaining Useful Life Prediction Prognostics and health management technology for industrial equipment heavily relies on the accurate prediction of the remaining useful life (RUL). As commonly used RUL prediction approaches, the conventional convolutional neural network, and long-short term memory network are not only difficult to realize the extraction process of spatio-temporal features, but also cannot reflect the difference between the data at different moments in the RUL prediction results. Aimed to deal with these problems, a self-attention mechanism network integrating spatio-temporal feature extraction (SAMN-STFE) is proposed to predict RUL, which can deliver higher weight to the significant moments. In detail, feature selection and noise reduction are performed on the data picked up by the multiple sensors during the working process. The self-attention mechanism network assigns corresponding weights to different time points in the time window. Afterward, the spatial features are extracted by one-dimensional convolutional neural network. The temporal features are extracted by bidirectional long short-term memory networks. Ultimately, the trained SAMN-STFE can be utilized for online RUL prediction. To validate the proposed approach for predicting RUL, the dataset of aircraft turbofan engines, furnished by NASA Ames Prediction Center is employed.

"Laser-Structured Thin Film Sensor Technology for Sliding Bearings in Internal Combustion Engines Global issues such as climate change, environmental pollution, and conservation of resources require manufacturers of internal combustion engines (ICE) to achieve substantially reduced emissions of greenhouse gases and pollutants as well as increased engine efficiency and durability. Condition monitoring and predictive maintenance approaches for sliding bearings in ICEs are key tools for increasing engine durability and saving resources by exploiting more of the useful lifetime of a bearing while avoiding critical engine operation caused by bearing wear and failure. These approaches require appropriate measurement technology capable of acquiring informative parameters that reflect the current condition of the bearings while withstanding the high temperatures and mechanical loads encountered inside the engine and accommodating spatial constraints. This paper deals with research work related to advanced sensor technology that is highly integrated into sliding bearings so that information is obtained nearly directly from relevant areas such as the bearing running layer and the lubrication gap. An isolated, sputtered sensor layer with a thickness of a few micrometers is employed in combination with a laser structuring process to form the desired thin film sensor structure below the bearing running surface.

"Fault Detection on Short-Haul or Highly Dynamic Flights Using Transient Flight Segments A machine learning-based approach is presented, which allows to detect persistent engine faults after a single flight. It utilizes transient in-flight measurements and a transient engine model. The time series of the residuals between the measured data and the data resulting from performance synthesis is evaluated using moving windows containing at least one transient segment. A continuous wavelet transformation and a pretrained convolutional neural network are utilized on the residuals for feature extraction. The fault detection is carried out via a one-class support vector machine, trained exclusively on nominal engine operation data. Therefore, the approach requires no a-priory knowledge of the effects of engine faults on the in-flight measurements. Under the assumption of persistent faults, all windows of a single flight, which contain at least one transient segment, are considered in order to improve the reliability of the fault detection. This approach is validated using measured data of a small helicopter engine that replicates the dynamic flight of the corresponding model helicopter on a ground test bed. Consequently, step changes as well as complex variations of the shaft power output are considered. Four standard gas path sensors are considered. The one-class support vector machine is used successfully to detect two types of total pressure sensor anomalies. Assuming a typical number of transient segments for an average short haul flight, it turns out that persistent faults can be detected within one flight with a probability of above 90%.  © 2025 by ASME.",2-s2.0-105001170679
"Establishing a protocol with potential for standardization in quality detection of thyme origin using a colorimetric sensor array approach Standardization is paramount for the production and quality control of medicinal plants and their derivatives. One method of achieving standardization is through chemical fingerprinting. Among various techniques, colorimetric sensor arrays are deemed a reliable method for the quality control and diagnosis of medicinal plants. Unlike conventional methods such as DNA barcoding and spectroscopy, chemical fingerprinting offers a different analysis of the plant’s unique chemical patterns. Colorimetric sensor arrays were chosen for their cost-effectiveness, ease of use, and rapid results. The objective of this study was to devise an effective method for the classification of ten different commercial brands of thyme and to compare them with three reference original thymes using a colorimetric sensor array technique coupled with mathematical data analysis methods. The findings indicated that colorimetric sensor arrays could effectively represent noticeable color changes between different essential oil samples based on Color Difference Maps (CDMs). The subsequent application of multivariate pattern recognition methods improved the discrimination ability between the samples. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) revealed the discrimination of three classes of the samples with 93% of the total variance, highlighting the distinct separation between different thyme origins. Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) elucidated the similarity of the studied commercial samples to the reference samples of thyme essential oil, demonstrating clear grouping patterns. Furthermore, Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) indicated that the majority of commercial samples were as similar as the thymus vulgaris samples, with fitting and validation accuracy of 95% and 91%, respectively. This analysis effectively discriminated the commercial thyme essential oil samples, highlighting their notable similarities to specific reference samples and clarifying the alignment or deviation from different reference standards. Lastly, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) confirmed previous results and differentiated the Thymus samples from zataria multiflora, with 100% fitting and 91% cross-validation accuracy. These methods together provided a comprehensive analysis, each contributing unique insights into the classification and potential standardization of thyme quality detection. Among the used sensing elements, 4 top sensor elements were identified using the factor loadings for the first three PCs of PCA analysis and discrimination ability. While this study primarily focuses on classification, it lays a strong foundation for future standardization efforts in quality control of thyme. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",2-s2.0-85210399812
"Monitoring of a machining process using kernel principal component analysis and kernel density estimation Tool wear is one of the consequences of a machining process. Excessive tool wear can lead to poor surface finish, and result in a defective product. It can also lead to premature tool failure, and may result in process downtime and damaged components. With this in mind, it has long been desired to monitor tool wear/tool condition. Kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) is proposed as an effective and efficient method for monitoring the tool condition in a machining process. The KPCA-based method may be used to identify faults (abnormalities) in a process through the fusion of multi-sensor signals. The method employs a control chart monitoring approach that uses Hotelling’s T2-statistic and Q-statistic to identify the faults in conjunction with control limits, which are computed by kernel density estimation (KDE). KDE is a non-parametric technique to approximate a probability density function. Four performance metrics, abnormality detection rate, false detection rate, detection delay, and prediction accuracy, are employed to test the reliability of the monitoring system and are used to compare the KPCA-based method with PCA-based method. Application of the proposed monitoring system to experimental data shows that the KPCA based method can effectively monitor the tool wear. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2-s2.0-85074576381
"Monitoring of Gantry Crane Track Health with Commodity IOT Devices The global supply chain depends on the efficient transfer of containers between cargo ships and ground transport. To ensure reliable operations, equipment at ports requires predictive maintenance, with minimal downtime, at scheduled times. One common piece of equipment, rail mounted automated gantry (RMG) automatic stacking cranes (ASC), can be outfitted with commodity acceleration sensors to better monitor the structural health of the crane and the rails on which the crane runs. The ratio of the rolling standard deviation of the crane vibration at speed versus at rest is a metric that can separate the cranes and rails into those that are in need of detailed inspection and repair, and those that are in good health. This method produced zero false negative, and an even split of true positives and false positives. The cost of a false positive is orders of magnitude less than the cost of a false negative, so this technique should help bend the cost curve down on RMG maintenance.  © 2023 American Society of Civil Engineers.",2-s2.0-85175088617

Any change in the physical state of numerous components, control machinery, as well as environmental factors, might result in these problems. In process industries, where prompt detection is crucial in maintaining high product quality, dependability, and safety under various operating situations, finding these flaws is one of the most difficult tasks.

"Research on robotic manipulator fault detection and diagnosis technology based on machine vision in complex environments Currently, machine vision-based fault detection and diagnosis technology for robotic manipulators is widely used. However, traditional machine vision has difficulty identifying manipulator failure in complex environments with dim lighting and large texture differences and the influence of such factors as image motion blur caused by robotic manipulator movement. This article discusses the failure factors of mechanical manipulators and systematically analyzes various links leading to failure and the current technology limitations. First, a gradient-based semantic segmentation method is proposed to extract targets quickly and accurately for the grasped object and complex surrounding environment. Second, when the vision and grasped object have relative movement in dim environment, a multiframe image registration and fusion method are proposed to obtain high-quality, clear image data. Then, a machine-based method is adopted to learn the fault detection and diagnosis methods that fuse internal and external sensors. Finally, a physical system is built to verify the three aspects of the target extraction effect: image clarity, fault detection speed, and diagnosis accuracy, reflecting the superiority of this algorithm. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",2-s2.0-85141419666
"Reconfigurable Guidance Strategy for Compensating Actuator Faults in Spacecraft Formation Flying The capacity to keep a desired topology with a requested accuracy plays a significant role in every spacecraft formation-flying operation. These missions can be terminated in case of an unexpected spacecraft fault, preventing the system from returning to its nominal configuration. This paper presents and tests a new recovery solution, called Reconfigurable Guidance Strategy (RGS), for the spacecraft formation-flying control problem subject to a look-inplace permanent thruster fault. The proposed method relies on autonomously and in real-time reconfiguring the guidance function to compensate for the loss of the spacecraft actuation system.

"Multisource information fusion based parameterization study of lithium-ion battery electrolyte leakage Electrolyte leakage can cause serious accidents and is a major hazard for battery thermal runaway due to the flammability of electrolyte. Currently, the method for diagnosing electrolyte leakage depends greatly on sensors, but its reliability remains questionable. The paper characterizes the electrolyte leakage based on multiple signals and proposes a multi-parameter fusion diagnostic framework for different conditions. Firstly, the electrolyte leakage behavior of commercial lithium-ion batteries is imitated on two aging conditions. Secondly, the evolution characteristics of the cyclic capacity of leaky and normal cells are compared. The features of leaky batteries are then extracted based on measurable electrical, thermal, and gas signals during aging period, and the diagnostic sensitivity and reliability of the characteristic parameters are analyzed. According to the analysis, the sudden capacity drop of leaky batteries is found to occur at the constant voltage charging stage, and the triggering mechanism of the sudden capacity drop is revealed. Furthermore, the parametric characterization for electrolyte leakage detection is elaborated. Finally, the electro-thermal-gas multi-parameter fusion framework for electrolyte leakage diagnosis is proposed based on the priority and combination relationships of each parameter.

Taking into account the computing capabilities and connectivity of the hardware available for smart manufacturing, we propose a particular solution that allows meeting one of the essential requirements of intelligent production processes, i.e., autonomous health management. Indeed, efficient and fast algorithms, that does not require a high computational cost and can be appropriately performed on machine controllers, i.e., on edge, are combined with others, which can handle large amounts of data and calculations, executed on remote powerful supervisory platforms, i.e., on the cloud. In detail, new condition monitoring algorithms based on Model-of-Signals techniques are developed and implemented on local controllers to process the raw sensor readings and extract meaningful and compact features, according to System Identification rules and guidelines. These results are then transmitted to remote supervisors, where Particle Filters are exploited to model components degradation and predict their Remaining Useful Life. Practitioners can use this information to optimise production planning and maintenance policies. The proposed architecture allows keeping the communication traffic between edge and cloud in the nowadays affordable “Big data” range, preventing the unmanageable “Huge data” scenario that would follow from the transmission of raw sensor data.

"AttMoE: Attention with Mixture of Experts for remaining useful life prediction of lithium-ion batteries For Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries, problems such as material aging and capacity decay lead to battery performance degradation or even catastrophic events. Predicting Remaining Useful Life (RUL) is an effective way to indicate the health of Li-ion batteries, which helps to improve the reliability and safety of battery-powered systems. We propose a novel neural network, AttMoE, which combines an attention mechanism with Mixture of Experts (MoE), to capture the capacity fade trend for battery RUL prediction. When facing the problem that raw data collected from sensors are always full of noise, AttMoE uses a dropout mask to denoise the raw data. For RUL prediction, one key idea is that the attention mechanism captures the long-term dependencies between elements in a sequence and more attention is paid to the important features that contain more degradation information; another key idea is that MoE uses many experts to increase model capacity to achieve better representations. Finally, we conducted experiments using two public data sets to show that AttMoE is effective in RUL prediction and achieves up to 10%–20% improvement in terms of Relative Error (RE).

"Deep graph feature learning-based diagnosis approach for rotating machinery using multi-sensor data It is necessary to monitor and evaluate health state of rotating machinery, which directly affects the quality and productivity of manufacturing processes. At present, most of the existing fault diagnosis methods focus on analyzing the single sensor data. There are several problems: (1) single sensor data which only contain partial fault information are used to construct the graph, limiting the diagnosis performance; (2) the extracted traditional features containing shallow fault information have limited application scenarios. Recently, graph feature learning-based diagnosis approach shows its powerful feature learning ability, which can overcome the limitations of shallow feature extraction.

"Detection and isolation of faults in a lithium-ion battery pack using a switched architecture of equivalent cell diagnosers Lithium-ion battery packs are typically built as a series network of Parallel Cell Modules (PCM). A fault can occur within a specific cell of a PCM, in the sensors, or the numerous connection joints and bus conductors. This paper presents a method of detecting a single occurrence of various common faults in a Lithium-ion battery pack and isolating the fault to the faulty PCM, its connecting conductors, and joints, or to the sensor in the pack using a Diagnostic Automata of configurable Equivalent Cell Diagnosers. This is achieved by activating a sequence of diagnosers that generate residuals for various sub-networks of the pack and test hypotheses on them to search for the smallest sub-network and the associated sensors that contain the source of the fault. The sequence of activation of the diagnosers follows the state transition of the Diagnostic Automata triggered by the outcomes of the hypotheses tests. Once the faulty PCM sub-network is identified, the fault type is classified based on selected features of the residuals. For robust detection, events arising from hypothesis tests in the diagnosers and the classifiers are used to compute the probability of occurrence of a specific fault in a specific PCM. The performance of the diagnostic framework is tested offline with experimentally obtained data from an automotive battery pack. Finally, a Hardware-in-the-Loop simulation test demonstrates that the proposed method can be implemented on standard Battery Management System hardware to avoid extensive damage to the pack, enhance safety, and facilitate quick cell-level replacements to repair expensive Lithium-ion battery packs. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85191547047

"Fault Detection and Diagnosis of Multi-Joint Manipulator Based on Multi-Information Fusion and Deep-Learning Machine Vision The multi-joint manipulator with vision sensors has been widely used in real applications. However, the fault detection and diagnosis accuracy are lowered and the time expense is increased for the increased number of sensors, as there are many factors that are relative with this problem. This paper is focused on the fault detection and diagnosis problem of multi-joint manipulator, and the problem was divided into two sub-problems. The first is that the position estimation strategy based on data fusion of visual sensor and the position sensor was designed to carry out the fault detection, and the whether the faults had happened or not were determined by the position estimation errors. The second was focused on the fault diagnosis problem, where the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) fault diagnosis model based on time-frequency mixed signal was constructed. The proposed DCNN uses the time and frequency domain information as its inputs and executes the classification tasks. The specific fault was determined through the output of DCNN model. The DCNN model was activated only when the first fault detection unit indicated that there was a fault, so the time expense was reduced from 5.3 to 2.6 s.

Especially, neural network (NN) strategies have focused on finding complex and nonlinear relationships between the sensor signal and the machine status to detect machine faults. However, it is difficult to collect enough amount of fault data as much as normal status data for training general NN models. To resolve the issue, this paper proposes the autoencoder-based anomaly detection framework for industrial robot arms using an internal sound sensor. The autoencoder uses signals in the normal state of the robots for training the model. It reconstructs the input signals as output, and anomalous states are found from high reconstruction error. Two stethoscopes were attached to the surface of the robot joint as sensors, and the sounds were recorded by USB microphone attached to the outlet of the stethoscopes. Features were extracted from STFT spectrogram images of the gathered sound, then used to train and test an autoencoder model. The reconstruction errors of the autoencoder were compared to distinguish the abnormal status from normal one. The experimental results suggest that the stethoscopes prevent the interference of noise, and the collected sound signals can be utilized for detecting machine anomalies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2-s2.0-85120310503

"Gas Path Fault Diagnosis Method Under Small Samples With Interclass Imbalance Current data-driven methods for diagnosing gas path faults in aero-engines often rely on large, costly fault sample sets and face challenges related to class imbalances. These include disparities in the quantity of normal and fault data, differences among fault types, and variations in fault severity levels. This paper proposes a novel generative model, TL-GMVAE, which integrates Gaussian mixture models (GMM) with variational auto-encoders (VAE) and incorporates a transfer learning (TL) strategy. Using a large dataset of normal operational data, the VAE learns latent feature mappings of engine behavior and establishes a joint probability distribution across sensor measurements. To account for complexity in engine operating conditions, the GMM is used as the sampling distribution of the VAE. This enhances the model's ability to represent diverse operating scenarios. The pretrained model is then fine-tuned with a small dataset of gas path fault data, transferring knowledge to fault domains. Each fault-specific TL-GMVAE model serves as an independent generator for synthetic fault samples. The proposed approach is validated using several established classifiers. The impact of different Fault-Normal ratios and imbalances across fault categories on classification accuracy is analyzed. Additionally, the robustness of the method to individual engine variability is evaluated. Results demonstrate that the TL-GMVAE generates high-quality fault samples and significantly improves fault diagnosis accuracy.

Mahalanobis distance criteria has been employed for selecting the strongest feature on the extracted relevant features. Finally, these selected features have been passed to the SVM classifier for identifying and classifying the various bearing defects. The results reveal that the vibration signatures obtained from developed non-contact sensor compare well with the accelerometer data obtained under the same conditions. A developed sensor is a promising tool for detecting the bearing damage and identifying its class. SVM results have established the effectiveness of the developed non-contact sensor as a vibration measuring instrument which makes the developed sensor a cost-effective tool for the condition monitoring of rotating machines. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2-s2.0-85075366201
"Analysis of High Frequency Component of Ultrasound Signal for Fault Evaluation and Condition Monitoring of Ball Bearing in Induction Machine Ball bearings fault detection with the aid of ultrasound technique is of great importance. Hence, this paper evaluates signal processing of ultrasounds sent by faults and addresses relevant challenges. In this regard, the waveforms of ultrasound signals were analyzed for different types of faults and considering specification of ultrasound channels to enhance the perception of ultrasound signal processing. For this purpose, different conditions have been considered such as waveform fading and the likelihood of frequency fading at lower signal-to-noise ratios. Furthermore, the sensitivity of ultrasonic sensors to fault detection at higher frequencies and the probability of the modulation have been assessed, and modeling results have been presented. In addition to modeling, fault detection in a ball bearing of an electromotor has been studied through an industrial-empirical case study. Therefore, the bearing signals have been processed for fault-free, initial fault, and advanced fault conditions. The studied fault emerged in several months (without hand intervention) and was then intensified over time. According to results, the envelope technique is capable of extracting fault frequencies of ball bearings. Also, high-pass filters have been employed to demonstrate signal shape mode and impulse generation in detail. Moreover, it has been shown that the growth of initial faults can generate new frequencies and fault frequency harmonics other than the fault frequencies of ball bearings. Also, important tips on the ultrasound fault detection of electromotor were provided with a potential effect on the entire fault detection process. These tips came from the author’s experiences obtained by monitoring rotary machines. In which, they can serve as a beneficial tool for monitoring of such machines in industrial sites. © 2023, ASM International.",2-s2.0-85175371609
"LSTM-based autoencoder models for real-time quality control of wastewater treatment sensor data The operation of smart wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is increasingly paramount in improving effluent quality, facilitating resource recovery and reducing carbon emissions. To achieve these objectives, sensors, monitoring systems, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based models are increasingly being developed and utilised for decision support and advanced control. Key to the adoption of advanced data-driven control of WWTPs is real-time data validation and reconciliation (DVR), especially for sensor data. This research demonstrates and evaluates real-time AI-based data quality control methods, i.e. long short-term memory (LSTM) autoencoder (AE) models, to reconcile faulty sensor signals in WWTPs as compared to autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. The DVR procedure is aimed at anomalies resulting from data acquisition issues and sensor faults. Anomaly detection precedes the reconciliation procedure using models that capture short-time dynamics (SD) and (relatively) long-time dynamics (LD). Real data from an operational WWTP are used to test the DVR procedure. To address the reconciliation of prolonged anomalies, the SD is aggregated with an LD model by exponential weighting. For reconciling single-point anomalies, both ARIMA and LSTM AEs showed high accuracy, while the accuracy of reconciliation regresses quickly with increasing forecasting horizons for prolonged anomalous events. © 2024 The Authors.",2-s2.0-85191427879
"Certain Investigations on Energy-Efficient Fault Detection and Recovery Management in Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks In recent years, underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) have been widely applied to aquatic and military applications. Network survivability is an essential attribute to be considered in UWSN circumstance and various stratifications like node survivability, connectivity and rapid fault node detection and recovery. However, efficient and accurate fault tolerance mechanisms are required to prolong the network survivability in UWSN. In this research work, the energy-efficient fault detection and recovery management (EFRM) approach is proposed for the UWSN with relatively better network survivability. The hidden Poisson Markov model has been incorporated in EFRM to achieve efficient fault detection throughout the whole network. Thereafter, the recovered node can be selected by using the analytical network process model which facilitates to recover the larger number of nodes in the damaged region. The simulation results manifest that when the fault probability is 40%, the detection accuracy of the proposed EFRM is over 99%, and the false positive rate is below 2%. The detection accuracy is improved by up to 12% when compared with the existing state-of-the-art schemes.  © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.",2-s2.0-85096232650
"Machine Learning Approaches for the Prediction of Gas Turbine Transients Gas Turbine (GT) emergency shutdowns can lead to energy production interruption and may also reduce the lifespan of a turbine. In order to remain competitive in the market, it is necessary to improve the reliability and availability of GTs by developing predictive maintenance systems that are able to predict future conditions of GTs within a certain time. Predicting such situations not only helps to take corrective measures to avoid service unavailability but also eases the process of maintenance and considerably reduces maintenance costs. Huge amounts of sensor data are collected from (GTs) making monitoring impossible for human operators even with the help of computers. Machine learning techniques could provide support for handling large amounts of sensor data and building decision models for predicting GT future conditions. The paper presents an application of machine learning based on decision trees and k-nearest neighbors for predicting the rotational speed of gas turbines. The aim is to distinguish steady states (e.g., GT operation at normal conditions) from transients (e.g., GT trip or shutdown). The different steps of a machine learning pipeline, starting from data extraction to model testing are implemented and analyzed. Experiments are performed by applying decision trees, extremely randomized trees, and k-nearest neighbors to sensor data collected from GTs located in different countries. The trained models were able to predict steady state and transient with more than 93% accuracy. This research advances predictive maintenance methods and suggests exploring advanced machine learning algorithms, real-time data integration, and explainable AI techniques to enhance gas turbine behavior understanding and develop more adaptable maintenance systems for industrial applications. © 2024 Arnaud Nguembang Fadja, Giuseppe Cota, Francesco Bertasi, Fabrizio Riguzzi, Enzo Losi, Lucrezia Manservigi, Mauro Venturini and Giovanni Bechini.

"Fault Precognition System for Remaining Useful Life Estimation in Bearing Systems Using Autoencoder-LSTM and Clustering Techniques This paper proposes a fault precognition system designed for predictive maintenance in bearing systems aimed at improving Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation accuracy. This study makes use of the Pronostia-bearing dataset, a recognized standard for RUL prediction and predictive maintenance. It includes vibration data captured by accelerometer sensors along two axes (X and Y), which shows how bearings deteriorate under different operation circumstances. The extensive size of the dataset, which includes several bearings experiencing progressive deterioration, guarantees strong validation of the suggested fault precognition and RUL prediction system in actual maintenance situations. The system utilizes the Pronostia bearing dataset, employing time-domain feature extraction, automated feature ranking, and fault pattern classification through K-means clustering with Silhouette Coefficients. A core component of the system is an Autoencoder-LSTM model, which identifies early fault occurrences by analyzing reconstruction loss thresholds—quantitative measures of deviation between observed and reconstructed data. These thresholds serve as indicators of anomalous behaviour, distinguishing normal operations from fault-prone data clusters. The system then estimates RUL using various LSTM variants, including Vanilla LSTM, BiLSTM, CNN-LSTM, StackLSTM, ConvLSTM and Encoder-Decoder LSTM, with performance evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R2scores. The results demonstrate that incorporating fault precognition into the system significantly enhances prediction accuracy, facilitating proactive maintenance and improving operational reliability.

"AHU sensor fault diagnosis in various operating conditions based on a hybrid data-driven model combined energy consumption Data-driven methods has the inspiring potential for sensors fault detection in heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) intelligence control system. However, the interpretability of pure data-driven methods is relatively poor. Moreover, pure data-driven methods heavily rely on quality of HVAC sensor data that causes pure data driven methods have inconsistent detection efficiency in various operation conditions and sensor locations, resulting in poor general applicability. To solve above problems, an enhanced data-driven model based on energy consumption correlation (ECC) is proposed. First, the collected data from sensors are collected in chronological order and undergo data preprocessing techniques for noise removal. Subsequently, the energy consumption data is utilized to differentiate the operating conditions of the HVAC system. Simultaneously, a mapping relationship is established between sensor data and energy consumption. It uses the mapping relationship to construct the ECC for faulty sensor detection. Finally, the diagnosis of air handling unit (AHU) sensor faults is achieved by employing the hybrid data-driven model based on the ECC. The experiment conducted a comparison between the hybrid data-driven model and two novel pure data-driven methods. The results of the experiment demonstrate that the hybrid data-driven model exhibits excellent fault detection efficiency across different operating conditions and sensor locations. The fault alarm rate of the hybrid data-driven model is 0–3.26% under various AHU sensor fault conditions. And the fault diagnosis rate of the hybrid data-driven model is 96.23% and 96.11% under single-operation condition and dual-operation condition, respectively. Furthermore, compared to pure data-driven methods, the hybrid data-driven model is less affected by data quality and possesses a broader applicability. © 2024",2-s2.0-85189041526
"Optimal cluster head localization for cluster-based wireless sensor network using free-space optical technology and genetic algorithm optimization Free Space Optical (FSO) is a wireless communication technology that is distinguished from other communication systems by several advantages including license free of operating spectrum, high data rate, low installation cost, and fast deployment. FSO is employed in many applications including Internet and mobile services links. Nevertheless, FSO link quality is affected by weather conditions including fog, rain, and snow. The main challenge of the FSO channel is the dynamic fluctuating of these weather conditions which degrade the link quality and reduces the data rate. Therefore, the development of robust FSO link topology is a crucial issue to overcome the bad and severe weather conditions. Cluster-based Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) arranges the network into groups called clusters where one Cluster Head (CH) is selected to manage the communication activities inside the group. CHs localization is the main challenge in cluster-based WSN. The key objective of this research is to develop cluster-based WSN that employs the FSO links to interconnect the CHs to each other. Optimal Cluster Head Localization (OCHL) algorithm is developed to optimally determined the locations of CHs so that the network diversity and coverage area of CHs are improved. Genetic Algorithm (GA) technique is used to obtain a near-optimal solution for the proposed fitness function. Simulation results show that the proposed OCHL algorithm improves the network diversity and coverage area of cluster-based WSN. The weighting parameter of the proposed fitness function can be adjusted to control the effects of covered areas, and link diversity in the fitness function. Additionally, increasing the number of CHs leads to improve the covered area and link diversity. Furthermore, with growing of the number of GA iterations, a better solution for the proposed optimization problem is obtained. Moreover, the Bit Error Rate and Signal to Noise Ratio of FSO links are evaluated based on the rain rate, snow rate, fog, transmitted power, transmitter and receiver aperture diameters, FSO communication range, and weighting parameter. The results demonstrate that the normalized covered area in case of using the proposed OCHL algorithm outperforms as compared to NFCA and LEACH algorithms with 12.95 and 8.52% rise, respectively. In addition, the proposed OCHL algorithm enhances the normalized link diversity by 14.15 and 19.21%, compared with NFCA and LEACH algorithms, respectively. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.",2-s2.0-85202496885
"An improved stacking ensemble learning-based sensor fault detection method for building energy systems using fault-discrimination information Sensor fault detection is essential to maintain operations of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems (HVACs) in buildings. Data-driven sensor fault detection methods are becoming increasingly popular recently. However, for the relatively limited modelling data available in the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system, it is a major challenge to extract fault-discrimination information (FDI) from limited data to develop a data-driven model with higher fault detection performance and lower false-alarm rate. Therefore, this study proposed an improved Stacking (IStacking) sensor fault detection method using fault-discrimination information. Fault-discrimination-information is extracted from original samples by subtracting the statistics with the threshold of each single model. Four different single models (i.e., principal component analysis, one-class support vector machine, K-Means clustering, and autoencoder) are employed to develop the ensemble learning detection method with relatively high generalization ability using a Stacking training manner. Sensor bias faults from two different sources are used for validation. Area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve (AUC) and false positive rate (FPR) are used to evaluate the detection performance and false-alarm rate. Results indicated that IStacking outperforms the four single models and traditional Stacking when the added biases are ranged [-4 °C, −2 °C] and [3.7 °C, 4 °C]. Since single models are stacked and fault-discrimination information is used to replace the original input, IStacking averagely increases Area under the ROC curve by 2.85% and decreases false positive rate by 5.76%. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85109580928

Pressure pulsations were investigated at different locations at the inner surface of the pump before and after the presence of the fault to determine the best location for installing vibration sensors on the pump casing. Experiments were also conducted by mounting accelerometers at various locations on the pump casing. Simulation and experimental results were then compared and a direct correlation between changes in PSD amplitudes of pressure and acceleration signals was observed. The optimum location for placement of an accelerometer was determined to be near the volute tongue on the casing where the highest level of pressure pulsations in the simulation was also calculated in the presence of vane tip fault. © 2020 Universidad Politecnica de Valencia.",2-s2.0-85094611688
"An interpretable feature selection method integrating ensemble models for chiller fault diagnosis Timely diagnosis of chiller faults is crucial for indoor comfort and building energy saving with the number of sensors being minimized. To address this challenge and select the top important features for chiller diagnosis (FD), a novel feature selection method (FSM) with interpretability is proposed for chiller FD. The proposed method integrates four ensemble models, namely, random forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost in the feature selection process. A feature sets fusion strategy is designed based on SHAP analysis and a novel normalized feature weight calculation (NFWC) method. An interpretability analysis is performed using SHAP.

"Component-level re-commissioning of a newly retrofitted Danish healthcare building The building sector is among the sectors with the highest energy use, responsible for 40% of the total energy consumption in the EU. The high energy consumption is partly due to inefficient operation and the delayed detection of faulty systems and components in the buildings, which entails both increased operational costs and CO2-emissions. Thus, building energy performance monitoring and evaluation is key in ensuring a proper building operation and timely detection of anomalies and faults on different levels. This can be implemented through systematic building commissioning, a quality-assuring process aiming to ensure that buildings are operating according to the expected performance. While initial commissioning of newly built buildings has been the norm in the last decades, re-commissioning of deeply retrofitted buildings is generally overlooked despite the potential and positive impacts. In this work, a whole-building EnergyPlus model is developed, calibrated, and employed for the re-commissioning of building components in a Danish health care building that has recently exhibited a deep energy retrofit process on various levels including the installation of new ventilation and cooling units.

"Performance Evaluation of Independent Component Analysis-Based Fault Detection Using Measurements Corrupted with Noise The detection of sensor faults has proven to be easier through data-driven methods which rely on historical data collected from sensors that are placed at various locations in a process plant. Since the distribution of industrial process variables is random and non-Gaussian, the independent component analysis (ICA) method has been better suited for fault detection (FD) problems. Whenever data comes with any level of noise, there is difficulty in separating useful information, which hence degrades the monitoring quality of an FD strategy. In this paper, the robustness of FD strategies is assessed for different noise realizations of sensor data using stochastic simulations. The main objective of this work is to demonstrate that ICA-based FD strategies are more robust for different noise levels in comparison with principal component analysis (PCA). The ICA modeling algorithm is improved to avoid random initialization of a de-mixing orthogonal matrix during computation of independent components. Two case studies are considered for evaluating the robustness of FD strategies: a simulated quadruple tank process and a simulated distillation column process. Comparisons have been carried out between ICA, dynamic ICA, modified ICA and PCA strategies for different sensor noise levels. The simulation results reveal that ICA-based FD strategies over-perform PCA FD strategy in monitoring sensor faults for different levels of noise. © 2021, The Author(s).",2-s2.0-85103158246
"Prognostic health management of the robotic strain wave gear reducer based on variable speed of operation: A data-driven via deep learning approach The robotic reducer is prone to failure because of its unique characteristics. Data from vibration and acoustic emission sensors have been used for the prognostics of the reducer. However, various issues are associated with such traditional techniques. Hence, our research group proposes a novel approach to utilize the embedded setup of the electrical current to detect the mechanical fault of the robotic reducer in the actual industrial robot. Previously, a comprehensive approach of feature engineering was proposed to classify the mechanical fault for the robotic reducer. However, handcraft-based feature extraction is quite a tedious task, and computationally expensive. These features require a well-designed feature extractor, and the features need to be manually optimized before feeding into classifiers. In addition, the handcrafted features are problem-specific, and are complicated to generalize. To resolve these challenges, deep features are extracted to classify the fault and generalize for two different motion profiles under different working conditions. In the proposed research work, the fault characteristic is generalized for variable speed of operations considering various kinds of scenarios. In this research work, the generalization capability of the proposed approach is comprehensively evaluated. For that purpose, the data under different working conditions such as of lower speeds, higher speeds, and speed sequestration are used as unseen data to validate the model. The authenticity of the presented approach can be supported by the performance evaluation for fault classification of the different motion profiles and speed of operations.  © 2022 The Author(s).

"Determination of time-to-failure for automotive system components using machine learning In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the connectivity of vehicles. This connectivity allows for the monitoring and analysis of large amount of sensor data from vehicles during their normal operations. In this paper, an approach is proposed for analyzing such data to determine a vehicle component's remaining useful life named time-to-failure (TTF). The collected data is first used to determine the type of performance degradation and then to train a regression model to predict the health condition and performance degradation rate of the component using a machine learning algorithm. When new data is collected later for the same component in a different system, the trained model can be used to estimate the time-to-failure of the component based on the predicted health condition and performance degradation rate. To validate the proposed approach, a quarter-car model is simulated, and a machine learning algorithm is applied to determine the timeto- failure of a failing shock absorber. The results show that a tap-delayed nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous input (NARX) can accurately predict the health condition and degradation rate of the shock absorber and can estimate the component's time-tofailure.

"Poincaré Plot Features and Statistical Features From Current and Vibration Signals for Fault Severity Classification of Helical Gear Tooth Breaks Most of the approaches of feature extraction for data-driven rotating machinery fault diagnosis assume characteristics of periodicity and seasonality typically inherent to linear signals obtained from different sensors. Nevertheless, the behavior of rotating machinery is not necessarily linear when a failure occurs. Thus, new techniques based on the theory of chaos and nonlinear systems are needed to extract proper features of signals. This article introduces the use of features extracted from the Poincaré plot (PP), which are computed over vibration and current signals measured on a gearbox powered by an induction motor. A comparison between the performance of classic statistical features and PP features is developed by applying feature analysis based on analysis of varaince (ANOVA) and cluster validity assessment to rank and select the subset of best features. K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) algorithm is used to test the performance of the selected feature set for fault severity classification. The use of PP for the analysis of nonlinear, nonperiodic signals is not new; however, its application in mechanical systems is not widely extended.

"Energy eigenvalues and neural network analysis for broken bars fault diagnosis in induction machine under variable load: experimental study In this paper, a technique primarily based on the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and the slip associated with a neural network (NN) for classification and fault detection of broken rotor bars in an induction machine has been proposed. The calculated energy in each decomposition level obtained by the DWT analysis and the slip of the motor are used as input to the classifier in order to diagnose the healthy and faulty classes. The advantage of this method lays in the use of one single current sensor with the slip factor in order to detect the presence of the fault and identify the number of broken bars under different load conditions. The DWT analysis is proposed to overcome the limitation of the Fourier analysis and it is mainly adapted for the non-stationary signals. Moreover, the slip factor is applied as a second input on the classifier of NN to eliminate the problem of low-load. Feed-forward multi-layer Perceptron neural network is chosen as a technique to classify the fault in an induction machine. This technique is performed and validated by experimental data. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2-s2.0-85103628765
"An Integrative Machine Learning Method to Improve Fault Detection and Productivity Performance in a Cyber-Physical System A cyber-physical system (CPS) is one of the key technologies of industry 4.0. It is an integrated system that merges computing, sensors, and actuators, controlled by computer-based algorithms that integrate people and cyberspace. However, CPS performance is limited by its computational complexity. Finding a way to implement CPS with reduced complexity while incorporating more efficient diagnostics, forecasting, and equipment health management in a real-time performance remains a challenge. Therefore, the study proposes an integrative machine-learning method to reduce the computational complexity and to improve the applicability as a virtual subsystem in the CPS environment. This study utilizes random forest (RF) and a time-series deep-learning model based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) networking to achieve real-time monitoring and to enable the faster corrective adjustment of machines. We propose a method in which a fault detection alarm is triggered well before a machine fails, enabling shop-floor engineers to adjust its parameters or perform maintenance to mitigate the impact of its shutdown. As demonstrated in two empirical studies, the proposed method outperforms other times-series techniques. Accuracy reaches 80% or higher 3 h prior to real-time shutdown in the first case, and a significant improvement in the life of the product (281%) during a particular process appears in the second case. The proposed method can be applied to other complex systems to boost the efficiency of machine utilization and productivity. © 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

"Independently recurrent neural network for remaining useful life estimation In the industrial fields, the mechanical equipment will inevitably wear out in the process of operation. With the accumulation of losses, the probability of equipment failure is increasing. Therefore, if the remaining useful life (RUL) of the equipment can be accurately predicted, the equipment can be maintained in time to avoid the downtime caused by equipment failure and greatly improve the production efficiency of enterprises. This paper aims to use independently recurrent neural network (IndRNN) to learn health degradation of turbofan engine and make accurate predictions of its RUL, which not only effectively solves the problem of gradient explosion and vanishing, but also increases the interpretability of neural networks. IndRNN can be used to process longer time series which matches the scene with high frequency sampling sensor in industrial practical applications. The results demonstrate that IndRNN for RUL estimation significantly outperforms traditional approaches, as well as convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory network (LSTM) for RUL estimation. © 2020, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

"Bridge Cable Anomaly Detection Based on Local Variability in Feature Vector of Monitoring Group Cable Forces The cable is the key supporting component of the cable-stayed bridges, and damaged cables will directly affect the safety and stability of the bridge in operation. Therefore, this paper proposes a bridge cable anomaly detection and localization method based on the variation in the group cable force feature vector. First, mechanical analysis was carried out on the correlation of cable forces between two cables on the same side induced by the single-vehicle case and a cable force feature vector was established to reflect the mechanical characteristics of the group cable forces. Second, a bridge cable anomaly detection method was proposed based on the variation in the group cable force feature vector. Third, the isolation of abnormal components of the cable force feature vector, which can accurately localize abnormal cables, was presented. The long-term monitoring data of an in-service cable-stayed bridge were utilized to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

"Enhanced Deep Learning Approaches For Diagnosing Drilling Machine Failures Using Gramian Angular Field And Markov Transition Field Encoding In the era of Industry 4.0, applying deep learning models for analyzing sensor data in machinery is a fundamental step toward developing predictive maintenance strategies. Deep learning models can automatically learn complex patterns and features from sensor data, making them highly effective in identifying early signs of faults or anomalies in machinery. This capability is often beyond the reach of traditional analysis methods (e.g., statistical features), which may miss subtle or non-linear patterns. By identifying these issues early, deep learning models enable proactive scheduling of maintenance activities, reducing unplanned downtime and preventing catastrophic failures. This study adopts a specific approach by focusing on diagnosing failures in the VALMET AB drilling machine. We use sound signals captured by AudioBox iTwo Studio microphones as our primary data source. The dataset, which includes 134 sounds categorized into Anomaly and Normal classes, is augmented using advanced techniques. We then employ the Markov Transition Field and the Gramian Angular Field encoding methods to represent the sound signals as images. These encoded images are subsequently used to train two deep-learning models with distinct architectures: ResNet50 and InceptionV3. The study’s results are promising, affirming the efficacy of our approach in detecting and diagnosing failures in drilling machines. © The Author(’s).",2-s2.0-85217283345
"Effects of various partitions on the accuracy of virtual in-situ calibration in building energy systems Sensor errors significantly affect the operation and control of building energy systems. Thus, using correct and reliable sensors can effectively reduce the energy consumption of building energy systems. Virtual in-situ calibration (VIC), which is based on Bayesian inference and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, can help avoid the installation of new sensors, effectively reduce the systematic and random errors of sensors, and improve the reliability of collected data. In the current study, six working conditions were designed to check the robustness and accuracy of the proposed VIC technology. It's shown that for the systematic and random error of various sensors, the improved component calibration method is the most accurate. Contrarily, the whole calibration method is the least accurate, whereas the performance of the three local calibrations is intermediate. The maximum errors of the whole, local, and component calibration methods were 973%, 112.7%, and 30%, respectively. This verifies that component calibration effectively reduces the possibility of abnormal data and also enhances the reliability of sensor measurements. For the whole and local calibration methods, the constraints between various parameters are significantly reduced because of the random and uncertain coefficients; consequently, a majority of the correction results deviate from their true values. It is not necessary to determine the sensitivity and normalizing coefficients through a complicated optimization algorithm or historical experience by using the proposed component calibration. Therefore, the component calibration method features advantages in terms of computational time and correction accuracy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85086478963

"Fault detection and diagnosis in air handling using data-driven methods Actuator and sensor faults are inevitable in air handling units. It may cause loss of energy and reduction in fresh air quality and may endanger human life in some cases like, e.g., the operation room. This paper presents a fault detection and diagnosis method in air handling units. At first, a model similar to the RP-1312 model was considered for air handling units. Some fault signals were then applied to the system, and finally, data were obtained to be used in fault detection block. Due to the high dimensions and volume of the data, the problem dimensions should be reduced while maintaining the quality of detection. One of the contributions of this paper is to examine the effect of various variables on fault diagnosis performance and, while retaining excellent variables, eliminates inappropriate and recessive ones. An optimal selection of the proper variables for fault detection makes the computational time of the algorithm significantly reduced. Considering abundant data and their nonlinear nature, support vector machines technique and radial basis function neural network methods were used for fault detection and diagnosis, respectively. In addition to using the radial basis function neural network method, the principal component analysis technique and kernel principal components analysis, which is the nonlinear generalization of the principal components, were used for fault diagnosis. The other contribution of this paper is to detect the sensor and actuator faults simultaneously.

"Sensor Condition Monitoring Incorporating Fault-tolerant Control With the increase in the requirement for control system reliability, fault-tolerant control has become an active research field. For sensor faults in nonlinear systems, based on the idea of active fault-tolerant control, the active fault-tolerant control method with double fault-tolerant controller switching is designed to solve the problem of fault-tolerant control of the system in the case of sensor faults, considering the factor of sudden load changes. Based on fault diagnosis, the method uses diagnostic information and historical data to estimate and compensate the impact of faults on the state estimation of the extended Kalman filter and then uses the compensated state estimation to design a fault-tolerant controller with state feedback that satisfies the stability condition to ensure that the system can operate safely in the case of sensor multiplicative faults. To further improve the dynamic quality. Based on the fault information contained in the deviation between the state estimate of the extended Kalman filter and the one-step prediction estimate, a fault-tolerant control method with a multi-step prediction value instead of the filter valuation constituting the state feedback is proposed to exclude the influence of sensor faults and improve the dynamic performance of the fault-tolerant control. Also, the method can effectively solve the fault-tolerant control problem of additive sensor faults.

"Voltage-correlation based multi-fault diagnosis of lithium-ion battery packs considering inconsistency Fast and accurate fault diagnosis is of great significance for the safe operation of lithium-ion batteries. The fault diagnosis method based on correlation coefficients solves the problem of the heavy calculation burden of the model-based diagnostic method. However, the inconsistencies that affect the accuracy and speed of diagnosis are ignored in the existing studies on correlation-based fault diagnosis. In this study, the influence of inconsistencies in resistance and state of charge on the correlation coefficients was considered to improve the accuracy and speed of diagnosis. Voltage sensor faults, connection faults, and short-circuit faults were detected and isolated according to the correlation coefficients and variation in the voltage difference. The cells were arranged in ascending order of the initial voltages, and every three cells were divided into a group. Only two correlation coefficients were calculated for each group. The accuracy and speed of diagnosis were improved by considering the inconsistencies. By grouping cells and introducing a new fault index, which is the variation in the voltage difference, the calculation burden was reduced by more than 50%.

"Remaining useful life prediction using physics-in-formed neural network with self-attention mechanism and deep separable convolutional network The remaining useful life prediction of rolling bearing holds significant importance in enhancing the operational reliability and reducing maintenance costs of the entire rotating machinery system. Deep learning techniques have shown promise in remaining useful life (RUL) prediction by leveraging their powerful representation learning capabilities. However, existing deep learning-based approaches still suffer from limitations such as reliance on hand-crafted features and lack of interpretability. Therefore, we propose an improved physics-in-formed neural networks (PINNs) based on deep separable convolutional network (DSCN) and attention mechanism for the RUL estimation of rolling bearings. Specifically, a deep separable convolutional network is introduced for feature extraction, which directly utilizes multi-sensor data as inputs and employs separable convolutional building blocks to automatically learn high-level representations. The features are then mapped to RUL using a self-attention mechanism-based physics-informed neural network. The hybrid prediction framework called DSCN-AttnPINN has demonstrated superior performance on the XJTU-SY dataset. The results of the experiments reveal that the DSCN-AttnPINN can accurately predict RUL and outperforms certain current data-driven prognostics methods. © 2024, Huatuo Culture Media Co. Limited.

"A Virtual Supply Airflow Rate Sensor Based on Original Equipment Manufacturer Data for Rooftop Air Conditioners The supply airflow rate is crucial for monitoring, controlling, and detecting faults in rooftop air conditioner units (RTUs). However, the cost and intrusiveness of a supply airflow rate sensor (SARS) make it difficult to deploy in the field. Virtual SARSs have been proposed, but they often require testing or experimentation to train the model, which is not easily scalable. To overcome this limitation, the present study proposed deriving supply airflow using publicly available and scalable original equipment manufacturer (OEM) data of RTU blowers. Two models, the gray-box, and the black-box, were proposed using the OEM data and applied to data from four different manufacturers. Despite limited OEM data, the gray-box model showed an accuracy of ±5%, while the black-box model provided high overall accuracy for the full range of data but yielded low accuracy (up to 27% error) at a lower blower rotation speed. The models were also validated through laboratory testing, with an accuracy of ± 10% for the motor speed range of 50%-100% of the rated speed. © 2023 American Society of Civil Engineers.",2-s2.0-85181085505
"Ai-based pdm platform in deciding failure of automobile scu equipment Recently, factory automation has been implemented using sensor networks. In general, the equipment deployed in automated factories is expensive. Due to the huge maintenance expenses associated with manufacturing plant equipment, there is a growing need for technology that can predict the lifespan of equipment consumables. Real-time fault prediction technology is essential because downtime in a process can led to substantial financial losses for a factory.

"Hybrid Multi-Scale Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory Network for Remaining Useful Life Prediction and Offset Analysis Prognostic and health management (PHM) has become increasingly popular due to the requirement of improved maintenance techniques in the industry. Remaining useful life (RUL) estimation is an important parameter through which PHM can be utilized to implement timely and cost-effective maintenance. Due to recent advancements in sensor-based and other Industry 4.0 related technologies, data-driven methods for RUL estimation have become more prevalent and effective. In this paper, a novel data-driven method for sensor-based RUL estimation using a combination of multi-scale convolutional neural network (MS-CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) is proposed. The proposed hybrid multi-scale convolutional LSTM (HMCL) model is capable of extracting both spatial features of various scales and temporal features from the input data to provide accurate RUL predictions. L2 regularization and dropout techniques are used to reduce over-fitting. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated using the C-MAPSS dataset. It achieves excellent performance as compared to other state-of-the-art methods making it a promising approach for sensor-based RUL prediction. Additionally, to discern the cause for occurrence of offsets, i.e., deviations in the model’s predictions with the true RUL value, an offset analysis is carried out.

The transmission of Data is achieved through the inter communication among the nodes participated in the network. For most participative nodes, there is a possibility of energy depletion and thus the network dies despite the other nodes having optimal energy for being operative. Bring decentralized, another classical challenge for WSNs is the threat of intrusion detection which may arise DoS attacks that depleted the energy as well. Major works in the literature focuses either attempts to address the Intrusion detection to fix DoS attacks or keep the optimal energy level by introducing energy preserving strategy and dynamic clustering strategy so that the network lifetime could be extended. This work deals with the hybrid model in which the nodes are clustered together to form the Connected Dominating Set so that the data transmission could be augmented. The objective of the system is to include only nodes with adequate energy that can ensure the validity of the network by marking them as CDS node. The CDS probability of a node depends on foresight of the energy of the participant nodes till the transmission. Packet distribution is done based on the CDS of the node and thus the inappropriate network breakdown that keeps same node waking so often could be avoided. Thereby, retransmission has been avoided due to packet drops, which also conserved the energy of the network.

"Handling fault detection and diagnosis in incomplete sensor measurements for BAS based HVAC system Due to the development of sensor networks, Building Automation System (BAS) based heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) has gradually replaced traditional HVAC to improve indoor thermal comfort and decrease energy consumption. Because of inevitable faults in sensors or networks, the real-time sensor data may be incomplete with corrupted, lost or undetected missing values. Therefore, Improved Fireworks Algorithm (IFWA)-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is proposed to recover incomplete measurements in BAS HVAC sensors. Because sensor data loss mostly results from incorrect control commands from the BAS system or sensor damage, there is a high probability of concurrent sensor fault. Therefore, Independent Component Analysis (ICA)-K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is proposed to monitor the sensor's healthy state under the measurements recovered. This paper discusses the possible causes of incomplete measurement in BAS HVAC sensors and simulates the distribution by experiment. The experiment analyzes the data recovery capability of IFWA-LSTM for different types of missing sensor data in different sensor measurement loss scenarios. The result shows that compared to the comparative methods, IFWA-LSTM achieves a 6.45 %–86.92 % improvement in recovery accuracy and a 0.0041 to 0.6340 improvement in correlation coefficients. Subsequently, it discusses the fault diagnosis rate of ICA-KNN under full measurements and incomplete measurement recovered by IFWA-LSTM. Overall, ICA-KNN achieves an average fault diagnosis rate of 99.86 % and an average fault alarm rate of 0 % under full measurement.

Time-series simulation data of various failure conditions, which include performance degradation, are generated to retrain the classifier networks to predict which components are failing at any given time. The test results of the retrained classifier networks show that the overall classification performance is good, with the normalized value of mean average precision varying from 0.6 to 0.65 for most of the retrained networks. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this work represents the first attempt to characterize such time-series data utilizing a multi-label deep learning approach. © 2023 by ASME.",2-s2.0-85175354891

"Fault detection and health management for machines of industry 4.0 using SVM and FTASL-LSTM Diagnosis of fault and prognosis in the Cyber-Physical System (CPS) has been developed and tested at a very rapid rate in the last few decades. However, due to the high difficulty of computer centers, research into optimizing the reliability of fault assessment, and prognosis through data analysis remains a prominent problem in this sector.

"Synergistic frameworks for sensor fault isolation and accommodation in grid-side converters The stable and reliable operation of grid-integrated renewable energy systems requires advanced control and coordination of grid-side converters (GSCs), utilizing the feedback measurements of voltage and current sensors from both the direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) sides of the converter. However, the effective operation of the converter is susceptible to sensor failures or divergence from their proper operation. Although sensor fault detection algorithms are usually effective under abrupt faults, the fault propagation effect caused by the physical interconnection between the DC and AC sides of the converter may limit the performance of the sensor fault isolation process in revealing the exact location of a potential faulty sensor. Therefore, this work proposes a robust, model-based fault isolation and accommodation scheme. Specifically, a synergistic sensor fault isolation framework based on adaptive estimation schemes is proposed for both single and multiple faults in the DC voltage and AC current sensors, considering modeling uncertainty and measurement noise. The performance analysis in terms of stability, learning capability, and fault isolability is rigorously examined. An accommodation scheme based on a virtual sensor utilizing dynamic sensor fault estimation with real-time learning capabilities is applied to a GSC. Finally, the performance of the proposed fault isolation and accommodation scheme is evaluated through simulation analysis under several scenarios involving single and multiple sensor faults. © 2024 The Authors",2-s2.0-85208233678

Sensor data validation and fault diagnosis for HVAC systems are essentially important to secure a reliable and efficient operation since sensor measurements are vital for the HVAC closed-loop control system. The aim of this work is to address this matter by developing a data-driven approach using the system's normal operation data and without the need for the knowledge of the mathematical model of the system. It is based on an Auto-Associative Neural Network (AANN) that is structured and trained to construct an input-output mapping model based on data dimensionality reduction that is capable of validating sensor measurements in terms of sensor error correction, missing data replacement, noise filtering, and inaccuracy correction. It can be used for both single and multiple sensor faults diagnosis by monitoring the consistency between the actual and the AANN-estimated sensor reading.

"Multifunctional Fiber-Reinforced Polymer Composites for Damage Detection and Memory Self-structural health monitoring (SHM) functionalities for fiber-reinforced polymer composites have become highly sought after to ensure the structural safety of newly advancing components in the automotive, civil, mechanical, and aerospace industries. This paper introduces a self-damage detection and memory (SDDM) hybrid composite material, where the structural carbon fiber tow is transformed into a piezoresistive sensor network, and the structural glass fiber operates as electrical insulation. In this study, SDDM specimens were fabricated, and tensile and impact tests were performed. The tensile tests of SDDM specimens find two distinct loading peaks: first where the carbon fiber fails, and second where the glass fiber fails. A linear correlation was observed between the carbon fiber resistance and composite strain up to a threshold, beyond which a sharp nonlinear increase in resistance occurred. The resistance then approached infinity, coinciding with the first loading peak and failure of the carbon fiber elements. This demonstrates the potential for a damage early warning threshold. Additionally, the effect of stitching the sensor tow in a zig-zag pattern over a large area was investigated using tailored fiber placement (TFP) of 1-loop, 3-loop, and 5-loop specimens. Tensile testing found that increasing the number of loops improved the sensor’s accuracy for strain sensing. Furthermore, impact tests were conducted, and as the impact energy progressively increased, the sensor resistance permanently increased. This illustrates a capability for self-memory of microdamage throughout the life cycle of the structure, potentially useful for predicting the remaining life of the composite. © 2023 by the authors.",2-s2.0-85172250391
"Development of a data driven FDD approach for building water networks: Water distribution system performance assessment rules While fault detection and diagnosis is a popular tool in the process industry, its application in building water distribution systems is however still largely absent. In this study, a new set of Water Distribution System Performance Assessment Rules (WDSPARs) were developed to identify common faults in a building water distribution system. The WDSPARs comprise a three-phase process which can be applied using flow and pressure sensor signals obtained in real-time and/or via analysis of historic data in conjunction with knowledge of water distribution system layouts. The performance assessment rules originated from analysis of behaviour in water consumption at two non-residential pilot sites over a 6 month trial. Implementation of WDSPAR at the two pilot studies revealed a number of faults and cases of non-optimal performance which were diagnosed and costed accordingly. The WDSPAR approach is intuitive and can be easily integrated into existing building management systems using sensor data. This study serves as the first practical guide for the implementation of the WDSPAR approach for adoption by large non-residential building end-users. Using the WDSPARs, the case studies outlined in this paper demonstrate 62% savings in water consumption which resulted in energy and carbon emission savings of the order of 50 kW h and 29.9 kg.CO2 per day respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85096367885

On the other hand, in order to improve failure categorization, the majority of contemporary machine-learning models require a substantial amount of data. In contrast to traditional maintenance, IIoT systems that perform real-time monitoring can be of tremendous service to the company. These systems can notify the necessary members of the factory's maintenance team in advance of a serious breakdown, which offers a significant advantage. It is of the utmost importance to detect any malfunctions in equipment while they are in operation before they become critical. The purpose of this work is to collect a substantial quantity of data from three AC motors, each of which is equipped with four different kinds of sensors. These sensors include a vibration sensor, a current sensor, a contactless temperature sensor, and an ambient temperature sensor. A variety of motor faults, including normal, vibration, stop, heavy load, and overcurrent, have been purposefully applied to the system in order to build the custom dataset. These motor’s faults have been categorized and labeled in accordance with their respective classification responsibilities. A deep neural network (DNN) model consisting of seven layers was utilized. A cloud server is used to train the model, and all of the data from the three AC motors are sent to the cloud server after they have been collected.

"Machine learning for air quality prediction using meteorological and traffic related features The presence of pollutants in the air has a direct impact on our health and causes detrimental changes to our environment. Air quality monitoring is therefore of paramount importance. The high cost of the acquisition and maintenance of accurate air quality stations implies that only a small number of these stations can be deployed in a country. To improve the spatial resolution of the air monitoring process, an interesting idea is to develop data-driven models to predict air quality based on readily available data. In this paper, we investigate the correlations between air pollutants concentrations and meteorological and road traffic data. Using machine learning, regression models are developed to predict pollutants concentration. Both linear and non-linear models are investigated in this paper. It is shown that non-linear models, namely Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Regression (SVR), better describe the impact of traffic flows and meteorology on the concentrations of pollutants in the atmosphere. It is also shown that more accurate prediction models can be obtained when including some pollutants' concentration as predictors. This may be used to infer the concentrations of some pollutants using those of other pollutants, thereby reducing the number of air pollution sensors. © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

To implement technologies and make decisions that lead to less energy demand, energy/power data are required.

In heat pump systems, sensors are highly susceptible to faults, leading to serious energy losses and system inefficiencies. However, the current research mainly focuses on the establishment of detection and diagnosis models for carbon dioxide (CO2) heat pump systems and intelligent fault detection methods.

"A high sensitivity and fast response methane sensor based on SnO2/Zn2SnO4 nanocomposite for lithium-ion battery fault detection Lithium-ion batteries, when undergoing thermal runaway, typically release a large amount of heat and gases, with methane (CH4) being one of the characteristic gases. In this study, a highly sensitive and fast-response methane sensor based on SnO2/Zn2SnO4 nanocomposites was successfully developed using a hydrothermal synthesis method. The microstructure, crystalline structure, and elemental composition of the material were analyzed using characterization techniques such as XRD, XPS, SEM, and EDS. The methane sensing performance of the SnO2/Zn2SnO4 sensor was tested at the optimal operating temperature of 480 °C. The experimental results showed that the SnO2/Zn2SnO4 sensor exhibited excellent sensing performance. The response/recovery time to 500 ppm CH4 was as short as 1 s/9 s, and the response value (4.16) was also significantly higher than that of the SnO2 sensor (2.7) and the Zn2SnO4 sensor (1.8). Additionally, the sensor demonstrated a low detection limit of 5 ppm and high stability, suggesting its potential application in monitoring thermal runaway in lithium-ion batteries. The superior sensing performance of the SnO2/Zn2SnO4 sensor can primarily be attributed to the n-n heterojunction formed between SnO2 and Zn2SnO4, which enhances charge transfer, and the nanoflower structure that facilitates CH4 adsorption.

"Fault detection, diagnosis and calibration of heating, ventilation and air conditioning sensors by combining principal component analysis and improved bayesian inference Sensors are crucial components in heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. When sensors fault, the HVAC system deviates from normal operation, resulting in an increase in energy consumption and a decline in equipment lifespan. Therefore, it is vital to detect, diagnose and calibrate the sensor faults. Bayesian Inference (BI) in data-driven methods is highly effective for sensor calibration. However, its application faces two major shortcomings. First, the conventional BI method cannot effectively calibrate sensor drift faults. Second, the BI method relies on sensor fault detection and diagnosis (FDD). To address these shortcomings, this study proposed an improved BI (imBI) method that enhanced the capability of BI to calibrate drift faults by updating the calibration constant x. Moreover, sensor fault detection, diagnosis and calibration (FDDC) were conducted by combining Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with the imBI method (PCA-imBI). The proposed methods were validated through two case studies involving a chiller system and an air handling unit (AHU) system, having different degrees of bias faults and drift faults in temperature sensors, differential pressure sensors and flow sensors. The results demonstrated that the PCA-imBI method effectively achieved FDDC for both bias and drift faults. Considering the case studies, the average calibration rates for bias and drift faults reached 99.74 % and 95.29 %, respectively. For drift fault calibration, the imBI method outperformed the dynamic calibration method and PCA reconstruction method by 16.04 % and 4.31 %, respectively. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85179890302
"Transfer learning with inception ResNet-based model for rolling bearing fault diagnosis With the development of information technology and sensor technology, people have paid more attention to data-driven fault diagnosis. As one of the commonly used methods in fault diagnosis, deep learning has achieved significant results. However, in engineering practice, the insufficient number of labeled samples for fault diagnosis and the poor targeting of extracted features lead to a limited structural depth of deep learning models and inadequate model training, limiting the diagnostic accuracy of fault diagnosis. A novel fault diagnosis method is proposed in this paper by implementing model-based transfer learning in the Inception-ResNet-v2 model.

"Energy harvesting for damage assessment: A novel approach for detecting and evaluating structural defects in composite laminates The presence of cutouts within mechanical equipment and systems can give rise to catastrophic stress concentrations and local buckling, leading to the initiation and propagation of damage. In addressing this issue, we leverage the concept of energy harvesting as a diagnostic approach. Beyond conventional fault diagnosis methods that rely solely on measuring changes in displacement amplitude, we propose an innovative method that harnesses the generated voltage. This novel approach investigates the impact of cutouts (holes) with varying diameters, which represent critical defects, on energy harvesting and displacement amplitude within 8-layer E-glass/epoxy composite specimens. Piezoelectric transducers are employed to execute energy harvesting, complemented by a laser displacement sensor for capturing sample displacement amplitudes. A bespoke measuring circuit is developed to quantify the stored voltage in a capacitor. Analysis of the findings reveals that the presence of damage, its severity, and its spatial distribution induce alterations akin to changes observed in displacement amplitudes. The study demonstrated that after applying the first cutout, a 75% and 65% reduction in harvested energy and a 60% and 46% decrease in displacement amplitude occurred for 14 and 10 mm cutouts respectively. By increasing the number of cutouts, these parameters depicted decreasing trends with a lower intensity.

"A hybrid multiple sensor fault detection, diagnosis and reconstruction algorithm for chiller plants In a chiller plant, primary or critical sensors are used to control the system operation while secondary sensors are installed to monitor the performance/health of individual equipment. Current sensor fault detection and diagnosis (SFDD) approaches are not applicable to secondary sensors which usually are not involved in the system control. Consequently, a hybrid multiple sensor fault detection, diagnosis and reconstruction (HMSFDDR) algorithm for chiller plants was developed. Machine learning and pattern recognition were used to predict the primary sensor faults through the comparison of the weekly performance curves. With the primary sensor signals reconstructed, the secondary sensor faults were estimated based on mass and energy balance. By applying the algorithm with various logged plant data and comparison with site checking results, a maximum of 75% effectiveness could be achieved. The merits of the present approach were further justified through off-site sensor testing which reinforced the usefulness of proposed HMSFDDR algorithm. © 2023 International Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA).",2-s2.0-85150924671
"Design of highly redundant fault tolerant control for aircraft elevator system Elevators are surfaces of flight control, typically at the rear of an aircraft to control the pitch of the plane, the angle of attack and the wing lift. The most critical actuation device is longitudinal aircraft control, and its failures will result in a catastrophic aircraft crash. This paper proposes a Highly Redundant Fault Tolerant Control (HRFTC) policy for the aircraft to accommodate faults in the critical sensors and actuators. Modified Triple Modular Redundancy (MTMR) has been proposed for the sensors and Dual Redundancy (DR) has been proposed for the actuators. The working of control laws, pilot order, signal conditioning, and failure are elaborated. Furthermore, the PID controller is used for the adjustment of the position of the elevator by comparing it with a set point. The results show that when a fault occurs, the system detects it successfully and tolerates it quickly without disturbing the flight of aircraft. The study is significant for the avionics industry for manufacturing highly reliable machines for human and environmental safety. © 2021 Institut za Istrazivanja.

"Adaptive-conditional loss and correction module enhanced informer network for long-tailed fault diagnosis of motor This study focuses on the motor fault diagnosis facing the long-tailed distribution data, characterized by a multitude of fault types with limited data per category and the healthy state with massive data. This skewed distribution makes the traditional diagnostic models fail to identify less frequent faults. To this end, we introduce a novel fault diagnosis model, named Transformer- and gated-recurrent unit (GRU)-based network (TransGRU), to improve the diagnosis accuracy with the long-tailed distribution data. The TransGRU has two main modules, i.e., the feature extraction module and the correction module. The former is based on the Informer encoder with ProbSparse self-attention to extract features from the long-range multi-sensor data. The latter employs the GRU network addressing the long-tail effect by adjusting the diagnosis results via the gate mechanism. Besides, we informatively design an adaptive-conditional loss (ACL) function for the long-tailed fault diagnosis by integrating the properties of focal loss, class-tailored weights, and confusion weights. ACL concentrates on challenging classifications while balancing the representation and significance of various fault modes. Validation on experimental motor data confirms the capability of our TransGRU in identifying a wide range of fault types with limited fault data compared with the Transformer and state-of-the-art methods. © 2024 The Author(s).",2-s2.0-85201774329
"A data-driven approach for fault diagnosis in multi-zone HVAC systems: Deep neural bilinear Koopman parity Sensor faults in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are inevitable and result in significant energy waste. This paper presents an innovative data-driven approach for sensor fault detection and isolation in multi-zone HVAC systems. The proposed solution integrates bilinear Koopman model realization, deep learning, and bilinear parity-space. A deep neural network realizes a bilinear model, enabling bilinear parity-space sensor fault detection and isolation. This yields a reliable, accurate, and interpretable data-driven framework. The method requires no prior HVAC dynamics knowledge, relying solely on normal operation data. It diagnoses additive, multiplicative, and complete failure sensor faults while minimizing false alarms, even with severe faults. A four-zone HVAC system is simulated in TRNSYS as a case study to demonstrate the performance and efficacy of the proposed approach. The proposed bilinear deep Koopman model realization is utilized to develop a bilinear model for the four-zone HVAC system. The bilinear model is then used for designing the bilinear parity-space. Further, considering various failure scenarios, the proposed sensor fault detection and isolation framework demonstrates promising diagnosis performance. Finally, a comparison is conducted to showcase the advantages of the proposed method over earlier works based on PCA and neural networks. © 2023 The Author(s)",2-s2.0-85163401004

"Framework for Offline Data-Driven Aircraft Fault Diagnosis This paper proposes a framework for aircraft fault diagnosis based on the offline analysis of flight data. It overcomes the limitations of current data-driven approaches by combining steps based on both real data, obtained from aircraft flight data records, and simulated data, generated from aircraft models. The framework explores unsupervised and supervised methods, resulting in a proactive approach to flight safety and speeding the learning of fault cases. The influence of both temporal data representation and sensor selection on fault diagnosis performance is analyzed. The framework is organized into four phases (initial, training, operation, and improvement) that cover the aircraft system lifecycle. We used the hierarchical clustering algorithm in the unsupervised part and an ensemble of three algorithms (k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, and neural networks) in the supervised one. The framework is evaluated using an aircraft electrohydraulic actuating system as the case study, for which we obtained a balanced accuracy of 96% in the operation phase and of 90.4% in the improvement phase. The contribution of the framework is also accessed through a comparison with results obtained using only supervised methods.

"Novel double layer BiLSTM minor soft fault detection for sensors in air-conditioning system with KPCA reducing dimensions The initial stages of sensor faults of air-conditioning systems are not easy to detect. They may affect the normal operation of air-conditioning systems, resulting in loss of energy and a quality reduction of the indoor environment. To accurately detect minor soft faults of sensors, this study presents a novel method of combining kernel principal component analysis and double layer bidirectional long short-term memory (KPCA-DL-BiLSTM). Firstly, kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) extracts the principal components of related variables (chilled water valve opening, supply air temperature, fresh air temperature, fresh air humidity, return air temperature, and return air humidity) of the air-conditioning system and reduces the dimensionality of features. Subsequently, the time characteristics of the data are converted into sequences with sliding windows, which are used as the input of double layer bidirectional long short-term memory (DL-BiLSTM). Finally, minor soft faults of sensors can be detected by the residual which is generated by comparing the output of DL-BiLSTM with the actual value from the supply air temperature sensor. The key contribution of this paper is to study the time dependence of sensor faults to improve the detection rate of minor faults. The experimental results show that the detection accuracy of KPCA-DL-BiLSTM was 43% higher than that of KPCA and 18.33% higher than that of the long short-term memory (LSTM) under a 10% drift deviation fault. It can be seen from the results that KPCA-DL-BiLSTM had better fault detection accuracy and stability for minor soft faults, especially for drift deviation faults. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85109548153
"Fault detection and diagnosis and fault-tolerant control for air-handling unit via agent-based hardware-in-the-loop simulation Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) can improve the energy efficiency of buildings while reducing utility costs and maintaining occupant comfort. However, in modern building management systems, the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) module tends to be complex, incurring significant software engineering and programming costs. The primary objectives of this study are to develop and evaluate an agent-based hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation that synchronizes a building energy simulation model with physical HVAC equipment operating in real time to evaluate the performance of FDD and fault-tolerant control (FTC) strategies. To achieve scalable and cost-effective optimal control and diagnostics, the proposed agent-based HIL simulation platform promptly connects to existing building control systems and utilizes their data to generate the necessary optimal control and FDD algorithms for intelligent building operation. The FDD algorithm utilizes virtual sensors (i.e., mathematical models) to estimate quantities that would be expensive to measure directly. Low-cost physical sensors, along with outputs from these virtual sensors, serve as the input for an autoencoder designed to identify and diagnose HVAC faults. Once the causes of the faults are identified, the FTC strategy minimizes the energy cost with respect to the fault severity, subject to occupant comfort requirements and the equipment capacities. The supply-air temperature is reduced significantly, which yields 10 % cost savings without compromising occupant thermal comfort. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-105008768354

"A novel IoT-based framework with Prognostics and Health Management and short term fire risk assessment in smart firefighting system In recent years, “smart firefighting” becomes a popular research topic which aims at improving the efficiency of fire protection and safety. However, in existing smart firefighting systems: (1) state and analog firefighting IoT data is not fully utilized; (2) fire risk assessment requires a long time to update; (3) few existing works can recognize faults and forecast potential risks with both temporal and spatial information from multiple IoT sensors.

"Design methodology of digital sensors for detecting laser fault injection attacks in FPGAs Laser fault injection (LFI) refers to a serious attack that modifies programs and data in embedded systems by introducing specific errors into a device in operation. As a countermeasure, in addition to duplication and optical sensors, the detection of LFIs using a sensor composed of digital circuits has recently been proposed. However, the research on the physical layout of these sensors is limited. In this work, we profile the laser irradiation position and its effect on the surrounding circuits by laser-scanning experiments on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Studies have shown that digital sensors with conventional designs have low-sensitivity areas with regard to LFIs. To improve LFI detection in FPGAs, we propose a design method for digital sensors and apply it to a ring oscillator (RO)-based digital sensor and a time-to-digital converter-based sensor. Experimental results show that the RO-based sensor based on the proposed method increased the area detecting LFI to about twice that of the conventional method, and detect 99.8% of the effective faults at the target register under protection. Furthermore, we extend the application of the RO-based sensor based on the proposed method to the protection of cryptographic circuits. The results of the laser-scanning experiment show that the proposed sensor detected 98.3% of the LFIs that caused effective faults in the cryptographic circuit. © The Author(s) 2025.",2-s2.0-105005515082
"Eso-kelm-based minor sensor fault identification Aiming at the sensor faults of near-space hypersonic vehicles (NSHV), a fault identification method based on the extended state observer and kernel extreme learning machine (ESO-KELM) is proposed in this paper. The method is generated by a combination of the model-based method and the data-driven method. As the source of the fault diagnosis, the residual signals represent the difference between the ESO output and the result measured by the sensor in particular.

Combined with more different features detected by KELM, the proposed method devotes to improving the accuracy.

"Low-story damage detection of buildings using deep neural network from frequency phase angle differences within a low-frequency band Lower stories of buildings are much more vulnerable due to the critically dead load from high stories. Vibration-based damage detection methods are commonly used to quantify damage with indicators and early assess structural deterioration. However, these indicators are usually not directly related to structural performance and can be distorted by the modeling errors or sensing uncertainties. In addition, damage detection of structures can be realized from sensor data by the remaining useful life estimation framework in machine learning. Meanwhile, a machine learning model, which detects structural damage, can be trained by the generated data from a numerical/identified model, e.g., phase angle differences of structural transfer functions. Moreover, the bounded nature of phase angles coincides with the needs of machine learning algorithms, and the combined stiffness and damping changes involved in damaged structures can also be considered in a learning model. Therefore, this study proposes a neural network damage detection method based on frequency response phase angle differences for low-story damage of buildings. In this proposed method, a simplified model is established from identified modal parameters of a structure and optimized using the least-squared stiffness approach, and the transfer function phase angle differences are generated from the model considering the stiffness and damping changes in various damage scenarios. The generated data are exploited to train a deep learning model which predicts the residual stiffness percentages as the condition parameters in the remaining useful life estimation framework. In this study, a numerical example provides detailed procedure to develop the neural network damage detection model and evaluate the effectiveness of the learning model. The proposed method is also employed in a scaled six-story steel-frame building for experimental verification. As seen in the results, the neural network damage detection method can estimate the residual stiffness percentages in the lower stories of a building based on frequency response phase angle differences. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85131081629

"Research on designated calibration method of fault sensor in photovoltaic thermal heat pump system based on fault detection and virtual calibration With the increasingly serious global energy problem, clean energy sources such as solar energy have become the mainstream focus of development. Among these, solar Photovoltaic thermal (PVT) heat pump systems have promising prospects. However, incorrect data transmitted by sensors can significantly impact the operation and control of the entire heat pump system, leading to reduced efficiency. Given the specific nature of PVT heat pump systems, their internal sensors are prone to errors during operation. To address these challenges, the Autoencoder Virtual in-situ calibration (AE-VIC) is applied to PVT heat pump systems. Preliminary studies have shown that this method can effectively reduce systematic and random errors in sensors. However, the current AE-VIC method faces certain issues, including unclear calibration targets and inefficient calibration of multiple sensors simultaneously, making it difficult to implement in practical systems. In order to overcome the limitations, fault detection is integrated with AE-VIC. By combining the feature extraction capability of Autoencoder with a Softmax classifier, sensors with faults can be identified before the overall calibration process, making the calibration objective of the AE-VIC more targeted. Following fault detection, inputs of the AE model are optimized using the mRMR algorithm for the identified faulty sensors. This optimization alleviates the difficulty of calibration. Through validation with actual system, the improved method effectively diagnoses and locates faulty sensors, and subsequently calibrates them. After calibration, the sensor system error can be reduced by over 95%. The improved calibration method surpasses the original AE-VIC method in terms of both time and accuracy. © 2023",2-s2.0-85165095445

"A Decentralized Boltzmann-machine-based fault diagnosis method for sensors of Air Handling Units in HVACs As a key module in a Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system, an Air Handling Unit (AHU) is controlled based on information collected by sensors to satisfy human thermal comfort and air quality requirements. Fault diagnosis is critical since it allows maintenance crews to know which faults have occurred to improve system availability. However, fault diagnosis in AHUs is challenging because of the following reasons. First, widely used fault indicators are correlated with changing environments, e.g., weather dynamics or occupants, thus may not be enough to distinguish faults. Second, existing decentralized fault diagnosis methods developed for sensors require solving many optimization problems, leading to high computational requirements. To overcome these challenges, this paper develops a decentralized Boltzmann-machine-based method. To address the first issue, residuals between actual values of several sensor readings and their estimates are considered as fault indicators since they are not related to changing environments. To address the second issue, a novel decentralized voting mechanism is developed based on the convergence characteristic of the Boltzmann machine to locate sensor faults while avoiding solving many optimization problems. However, the established Boltzmann machine usually has an asymmetric weight matrix, and thus it does not converge to the state estimates of sensors. To guarantee convergence, a new symmetrization method is developed to symmetrize the Boltzmann machine by adding an extra unit into the Boltzmann machine to reset the weight matrix while retaining the original voting. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively diagnose sensor faults with high diagnostic accuracy. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85124203193
"NBLSTM: Noisy and Hybrid Convolutional Neural Network and BLSTM-Based Deep Architecture for Remaining Useful Life Estimation Smart manufacturing and industrial Internet of things (IoT) have transformed the maintenance management concept from the conventional perspective of being reactive to being predictive. Recent advancements in this regard has resulted in development of effective prognostic health management (PHM) frameworks, which coupled with deep learning architectures have produced sophisticated techniques for remaining useful life (RUL) estimation. Accurately predicting the RUL significantly empowers the decision-making process and allows deployment of advanced maintenance strategies to improve the overall outcome in a timely fashion. In light of this, the paper proposes a novel noisy deep learning architecture consisting of multiple models designed in parallel, referred to as noisy and hybrid deep architecture for remaining useful life estimation (NBLSTM). The proposed NBLSTM is designed by integration of two parallel noisy deep architectures, i.e., a noisy convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract spatial features and a noisy bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) to extract temporal information learning the dependencies of input data in both forward and backward directions. The two paths are connected through a fusion center consisting of fully connected multilayers, which combines their outputs and forms the target predicted RUL. To improve the robustness of the model, the NBLSTM is trained based on noisy input signals leading to significantly robust and enhanced generalization behavior. Through 100 Monte Carlo simulation runs performed under three different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values, it can be noted that utilization of the noisy training enhanced the results by reducing the standard deviation (std) between 9% and 67% across different settings in terms of the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and between 21% and 63% in terms of the score value.

"Data Fusion for Optimal Condition-Based Aircraft Fleet Maintenance With Predictive Analytics Maintaining and deploying a fleet of aircraft with limited resources and various mission requirements is both immensely challenging and of primary importance. Traditional preventive maintenance methods are static and inflexible and are not equipped to consider the complex dynamics of aircraft (e.g., wear and age), which may lead to low fleet availability and high maintenance costs. In this paper, we propose an integrated learn-then-optimize framework for condition-based predictive maintenance scheduling to support daily flight and maintenance planning by fusing data from multiple onboard sensors. The paradigm first predicts the remaining useful life for components of aircraft by using deep learning techniques, then models the fleet-level optimization as a constrained mixed-integer programming problem that captures different failure modes of aircraft and the available maintenance facilities.

"Fault Diagnosis of Air Handling Units in an Auditorium Using Real Operational Labeled Data across Different Operation Modes Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) in air handling units (AHUs) is essential for ensuring indoor air quality and prolonging system life span. However, the use of real operational data for FDD has been limited in existing research, largely due to challenges in data availability and the complexity of fault annotation. This study specifically focuses on AHUs with constant air volume (CAV) systems, a critical component of HVAC operations within an auditorium. Data from 15 different sensors installed across 13 AHUs in the auditorium were collected and analyzed. Seven operational conditions were identified - including normal operation and six fault types - and were annotated accordingly. Nine supervised machine learning methods were applied to FDD tasks involving these operational conditions. Three types of models were developed: an integrated model trained on both cooling and heating data sets, a cooling model trained exclusively on cooling data, and a heating model trained exclusively on heating data. Each method underwent hyperparameter tuning across 10 configurations, resulting in a total of 270 models (9 methods × 10 configurations × 3 model types). These models were validated to identify the best-performing model in each category based on F1-scores. The integrated model achieved average F1-scores of 95.43% for the cooling season and 95.65% for the heating season.

"Impacts of data uncertainty on the performance of data-driven-based building fault diagnosis Artificial intelligence shows powerful capacity in modern building fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) systems. Existing data-driven-based FDD models are typically developed based on experimental data or simulation data and their performance highly depend on the data quality. Nevertheless, the available data in real buildings are often uncertain due to innate measurement errors, discontinuous sampling, sensor aging, etc. Accordingly, existing data-driven-based approaches may not present sufficient values for practical applications. This paper investigates the impacts of data uncertainty on data-driven-based building FDD model from two levels. At the high level, the impacts of data uncertainty on performance of FDD model are examined under different input feature numbers, i.e., 3, 8, 22 and 36. At the low level, the impacts of data uncertainty under various input features are evaluated at four uncertainty levels. The Coefficient of Performance Degradation (CPD) index is designed to quantify the impacts of data uncertainty. The chiller operation data of the ASHRAE 1043-RP project is employed as a case study. Diagnosis results reveal that the performance of FDD model will decline as the reduction of feature number under uncertain inputs. Besides, the diagnostic accuracy dramatically descends with increases of uncertainty level. The maximum accuracy decline is 20.9% when uncertainty level of kW increased from ±0.0 to ±1.0. Moreover, results show the data uncertainties cause greater effects on diagnosing global fault rather than diagnosing local fault. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85119593085
"Prognostics and Health Management of Unmanned Surface Vessels: Past, Present, and Future With the increasing popularity and deployment of unmanned surface vessels (USVs) all over the world, prognostics and health management (PHM) has become an indispensable tool for health monitoring, fault diagnosis, health prognosis, and maintenance of marine equipment on USVs. USVs are designed to undertake critical and extended missions, often in extreme conditions, without human intervention. This makes the USVs susceptible to equipment malfunction, which increases the probability of system failure during mission execution. In fact, in the absence of any crew onboard, system failure during a mission can create a great inconvenience for the concerned stakeholders, which compels them to design highly reliable USVs that must have integrated intelligent PHM systems onboard. To improve mission reliability and health management of USVs, researchers have been investigating and proposing PHM-based tools or frameworks that are claimed to operate in real time. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the existing literature on recent developments in PHM-related studies in the context of USVs. It covers a broad perspective of PHM on USVs, including system simulation, sensor data, data assimilation, data fusion, advancements in diagnosis and prognosis studies, and health management. After reviewing the literature, this study summarizes the lessons learned, identifies current gaps, and proposes a new system-level framework for developing a hybrid (offline-online) optimization-based PHM system for USVs in order to overcome some of the existing challenges.

"Efficient health monitoring of buildings using failure modes and effects analysis case study: Air handling unit system System health management based on condition monitoring is of great value and significance for improving system performance and reliability. As more data from condition monitoring is obtained, the efficiency of system health monitoring improves. However, increasing the amount of data by installing new sensors on system components is restricted by a variety of factors such as budget, weight and space allowance. Therefore, sensor selection in the most optimal manner in order to achieve maximum valuable information from system is an important issue. In this study, a novel concept is introduced that can be used in sensor combination optimization problems. This concept employs failure modes and effect analysis method in signal information value quantification procedure. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, an optimization tool is developed based on the proposed methodology for an air handling unit as a case study. This tool offers sensor combination optimization and visualization of key failure mode parameters. Results show that the optimal sensor combination lead to a maximum information on system health considering budget limits. In addition, the sensitivity analysis on severity factor of component failures is performed. Results indicate that, by increasing the severity factor of a component failure, the optimization model select sensors that monitor more information on that failure mode. According to the results obtained, the proposed methodology can be used in maximizing the performance of health monitoring and management of complex systems with numerous applications including aerospace, oil and gas industry, and medical technology. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85076270437
"Real-world prototyping and evaluation of digital twins for predictive facility maintenance Digital Twins (DTs) hold promise for the effective implementation of predictive maintenance (PdM) in constructed facilities. However, their adoption in the AECO industry is lagging due to the low level of knowledge on their design and implementation, influenced by the lack of real-world exemplars. This paper presents two real-world BIM-based DTs for PdM in an existing building, detailing the methodology for their design and implementation. The two DT designs cover sensor data integration from legacy systems with digital models of the facility and the programming of analytics for PdM as well as data modeling for representing the physical objects in the digital model. In addition, the paper evaluates the two DT solutions and provides key considerations to make when deciding whether to build or buy. Overall, the study makes contributions towards criteria for DT platform selection, “build versus buy” comparisons, system architecture design, and end-user feedback on DT user interactions and task-dependent performance. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85205510697
"Cyber-resilient energy infrastructure and IoT Energy infrastructure is of strategic importance to every nation as it plays a significant role in the development of a country. Smart grid, the new-generation power grid, focuses on duplex communication between suppliers and consumers. The heterogeneous nature of smart grid possesses different security threats, and integrating these components in the grid increases the possibility of vulnerabilities. The major challenge is to make sure that power availability is not affected when implementing security in the grid and hence a cyber-resilient smart grid is the need of the hour. Secure smart grid last-mile communication includes secure smart meters, smart homes and home area network. Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled smart homes are distributed throughout the smart grid home area network to facilitate the dynamic nature of grid.

"Comparison of deep learning models for predictive maintenance There is a clear intersection between the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). IoT is about connecting machines and making use of the data generated from those machines. AI is about simulating intelligent behaviour in machines of all kinds. As IoT devices will generate vast amounts of data, then AI will be functionally necessary to deal with these huge volumes if we're to have any chance of making sense of the data. AI is beneficial for both real-time and post event processing: Post event processing-identifying patterns in data sets and running predictive analytics, e.g. the correlation between traffic congestion, air pollution and chronic respiratory illnesses within a city centre.

"Towards IoT monitoring of street-side monuments: The Florentine Dietrofront as a case study The need for care often shown by ageing cultural heritage and the circumstantial lack of dedicated budget are increasingly calling for smart monitoring solutions to shift the maintenance paradigm from reactive-preventive to predictive. Monitoring artworks poses additional issues with respect to the more common industrial solutions, such as aesthetics, dealing with unusual materials, remote locations (archaeology), etc. In this scope, the “Dietrofront” statue in Florence, by artist Michelangelo Pistoletto, is an emblematic instance. Installed on a traffic roundabout, it comprises four travertine blocks, one of which hangs 5 m above the ground supported by a steel structure which has shown relevant symptoms of damage during the 2006 restoration works. During a later intervention, we seized the opportunity to equip the structure with a three IoT sensing devices, so as to monitor thermo-hygrometric conditions, inclination and vibrations of the structure. Various issues common to outdoor monuments have been faced, such as the need for visual non-intrusiveness and the unavailability of power supply. A small wireless sensor network was designed and installed, also exploiting an existing room inside the nearby mediaeval city gate. The network is fully solar-powered by photo-voltaic modules integrated on both the statue and the gate and not visible from the street. The data obtained have been analysed and compared to a simple lumped-parameters structural model, so as to estimate the relevance of traffic-induced vibration on the steel structure. The risk of water vapour condensation has also been assessed. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.",2-s2.0-85096839801
"Anomaly Detection and Classification in Predictive Maintenance Tasks with Zero Initial Training The Fourth Industrial Revolution has led to the adoption of novel technologies and methodologies in factories, making these more efficient and productive.

"An exemplary ground network for the generation of the galileo ARAIM ISM - Integrity Risk assessment and a novel high sensitive SiS Monitor Advanced Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (ARAIM) is a future Safety-of-Life (SoL) service which aims at proving global integrity using multiple GNSS constellations and dual-frequency services. The ARAIM concept foresees the provision to the user of an Integrity Support Message (ISM) specific for each constellation. The performance parameters included in the ISM allow the user to compute its own integrity service level. Constellation Service Providers (CSP) are responsible for the commitments published in the standards and for the dissemination of the message. An ISM Generator (ISMG) will be responsible for the content of the ISM and in charge of validating the CSP commitments by monitoring the nominal performance of the system and detect fault events. This work starts highlighting the main limitations and constraints an ISMG and in particular its ground monitoring network might face, first of all in terms of geographical distribution and extension of the sensor stations. Analysis and recommendations on the design and dimensioning of the ground monitoring network are provided, including recommendation on the handling of data gaps and the assessment of the corresponding integrity risk. The analysis comprises the derivation of the probability of coverage based on statistical analysis of the probability of cycle clips, loss-of-lock and carrier-to-noise ratio for a typical geodetic station. It follows the assessment of the estimation accuracy of the precise clock reference. The accuracy is based on an extensive statistical analysis on the receiver performance in terms of code and carrier phase error for a typical geodetic receiver. This works also presents a methodology allowing the ISMG to validate the system performance under nominal conditions, and to detect and validate Signal-in-Space (SiS) fault events, minimizing also the probability of missed detection. This validation process shall de-facto prevent the use of inaccurate or misleading products, cancelling the risk of artificial detection of satellite faults. The validation process has also the dual purpose of confirming a satellite faults in case this has been detected by the ISM generator. The validity of this method has been demonstrated by re-processing fault events and satellite anomalies from the past, like clock jump, clock drift, wrong navigation message, wrong precise reference, and carrier spikes on GPS due to the flex power adjustment, showing that the method not only enables a certain detection of a real fault and exclusion of artefacts, but also allows undoubtedly distinguish the nature of the fault, whether caused by wrong broadcast orbit and clock or caused by a satellite malfunction.

"Proof-of-authority-based secure and efficient aggregation with differential privacy for federated learning in industrial IoT The industrial internet of things (IIoT) uses connected devices and sensors to improve efficiency in industry, but increased reliance on these systems makes them prone to faults. To ensure the reliability of IIoT systems, robust fault detection is necessary, which can be provided by artificial intelligence (AI). The current state-of-the-art approach for AI in IIoT is mainly focused on centralized learning, which is inefficient due to its high communication cost. Federated learning (FL) addresses this limitation by enabling distributed training without exposing individual information. In order to provide secure and efficient FL for the IIoT environment, several research studies have investigated the use of blockchain networks. However, most of these studies ignore the processing time metric, which is crucial for IIoT networks. In this paper, we propose a secure and efficient parameter aggregation technique that enhances trust, security, and privacy for IIoT.

"Estimating vibration sources for industrial IoT using dilated CNN and deconvolution To minimize data traffic in industrial IoT applications, vibration-based condition monitoring should be conducted on sensors and without requiring machine-specific information. The proposed method enables blind estimation of vibration sources, eliminating the need for information about the monitored equipment or external measurements. Vibrations in rotating machinery primarily originate from two sources: dominant gear-related vibrations and low-energy signals associated with bearing faults. Both sources are distorted by the machine's transfer function before reaching the sensor. This method estimates both sources in two stages: first, the gear signal is isolated using a dilated CNN; second, the bearing fault signal is estimated using the squared log envelope of the residual. The effect of the transfer function is removed from both sources using a novel whitening-based deconvolution method (WBD). Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate the method's ability to detect bearing failures early without additional information. This study considers both local and distributed bearing faults, assuming the vibrations are recorded under stable operating conditions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",2-s2.0-85199930503
"Aggregate Programming for Customized Building Management and Users Preference Implementation Cognitive buildings are equipped with sensors and actuators to customize the indoor conditions according to users’ needs and preferences. The eLUX lab, at the Smart Campus of the University of Brescia (Italy), is the first national cognitive building where educational spaces are monitored and dashboards promote the users’ awareness. There, a fixed IoT network allows gathering data to perform analytics for prompt fault detection and fine-tuning of the conditions and possibly of the energy management. However, the users’ involvement is paramount for correct tuning and customization, as indoor conditions can be measured by a sensor (e.g., temperature, humidity, illuminance, CO2 concentration) located in a single point in the indoor space, while the parameters can strongly vary in the presence of, e.g., a fan coil or the distance from the windows and doors. To address this issue, an RTLS (Real-Time Location System) can be connected to the users’ direct and indirect feedback to support a precise definition of the indoor conditions and boost the improvement of the cognitive behaviour (i.e., automatic window opening or lighting dimming).

"Determining the location of sensors for seismic damage detection in steel girder bridges with elastomeric bearings In planning a bridge health monitoring with minimum sensors for long-term monitoring, it is necessary to accurately predict the bridge behavior including its nonlinearity and identify the damaged bridge components when a strong earthquake strikes. This article presents a methodology for the selection of sensors and their arrangement for detecting seismic damage in an in-service steel plate girder bridge system. In this study, a detailed span-based model was developed for the finite element simulation including the effect of the rubber bearing and piers, and the damage control by the side blocks. The finite element dynamic simulation was carried out with input earthquake acceleration to investigate the seismic behavior and grasp the damageable parts during an earthquake. Based on the results of finite element dynamic simulation, a fault tree analysis was carried out to reveal more about the bridge behavior, the failure modes, and the occurrence of damage. It was found that the side block, the bearing stiffener, and the horizontal bracing on the fixed side of the bridge are most important to be monitored for the evaluation of soundness of a plate girder bridge immediately after an earthquake.

This model has the ability of high-quality data transmission, high accuracy accident diagnosis classification and real-time anomaly monitoring, which makes up for the shortcomings of traditional IoMT models. In particular, for the accident diagnosis and classification functions in this model, we innovatively adopt the multi-mode data fusion CNN algorithm. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy of the accident diagnosis results is effectively improved.

The architecture allows resilient sensor management and multi-sensor fusion, including (a) incorporating measures of reliability into measurement fusion for robust PNT estimates; (b) detecting sensor faults and resilient sensor management; (c) smooth transition from GPS availability to GPS-denied and vice versa; (d) support for civilian GPS receivers to combine both military and civil signals from multiple GNSS's; (e) using redundant IMUs to increase performance during GPS outages; and (f) using the holdover oscillator (master-clock) over a distributed network for TDOA/TOA positioning. Considering the system design for dismounted warfighters, the dead-reckoning module was developed to treat the human body as a virtual sensor used in estimating the dismount's locomotion pattern. A closed feedback between the dead-reckoning module and 3D vision modeling is the main advantage of the solution.

"Current sensor fault detection and compensation system for wound rotor synchronous motor based on neural networks The article presents the idea of using an artificial neural network-based fault classification system for the current sensor (CS) faults. The analysis includes a wound rotor synchronous motor drive system designed according to the idea of fault-tolerant control (FTC).

"Diagnosis of Hydrodynamic Bearings by Evaluation based on Orbital Analysis Approach The evaluation and diagnosis of rotating machines rely on several approaches. However, for a complex system or in the presence of several faults, these approaches become less robust, less accurate, and less reliable. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes a diagnostic approach for hydrodynamic bearings in a rotating machine based on orbital analysis. This approach requires piezoelectric material sensors installed in the three directions: X, Y, and Z. Its objective is to evaluate the performance of the hydrodynamic bearing by comparing the collected data with the ISO 7919-5 standard. The methodology is based on data acquisition using several sensors measuring the displacements of the shaft line. Then, the results are analyzed according to the indicators required by ISO 7919-5, such as: Smax, Spp, Sp1, Sp2, eccentricity, and barycenter G along X and Y. The shaft line displacement orbits make it possible to assess the health of the hydrodynamic bearing and identify possible defects. Finally, the proven results of this approach provide an accurate and efficient diagnosis of the operating state. The approach used has demonstrated a good assessment and a relevant diagnosis. This validates its ability to implement it in future research work, such as the diagnosis of complex rotating machines, mechanical systems in the presence of several defects, and the exploitation of this data in real time in the prediction of mechanical defects by the implementation of an expert system. © 2025 Jordan Journal of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering.

"Optimized Wavelet Transform for the Development of an Algorithm Designed for the Analysis of Digital Substation Electrical Equipment Parameters This study emphasizes the urgent need for systems that monitor the operational states of primary electrical equipment, particularly power transformers. The rapid digitalization of and increasing data volumes from substations, coupled with the inability to retrofit outdated equipment with modern sensors, underscore the necessity for algorithms that analyze the operational parameters of digital substations based on key power system metrics such as current and voltage. This research focuses on digital substations with Architecture III and aims to develop an algorithm for processing digital substation data through an appropriate mathematical tool for time-series analysis. For this purpose, the fast discrete wavelet transform was chosen as the most suitable method. Within the framework of the research, possible transformer faults were divided into two categories by the nature of their manifestation. A mathematical model for two internal transformer fault categories was built. The most effective parameters from the point of view of the possibility of identifying an internal fault were selected.

"Diagnostics of electro-mechanical actuators based upon the back-EMF reconstruction Electrical systems are gradually replacing the more traditional hydraulic and pneumatic solutions for the transmission of secondary energy for onboard aircraft equipment. Therefore fault detection and health management strategies properly conceived for electrical devices are becoming a highly relevant topic for research and development in the aerospace disciplines. One possible practical implementation of these methodologies would be the identification of parameters for diagnostic and prognostic monitoring, which are highly sensitive to incipient faults but, at the same time, are less influenced by operating conditions (external loads, command input, temperatures, etc.). In this paper, the authors evaluated the effectiveness of counter-electromotive force (back-EMF) coefficient as a prognostic parameter, emphasizing a novel sampling approach that significantly lower the computational effort required while maintaining a good back-EMF coefficient curve reconstruction. The approach is virtual sensor-like, using only already available data for the correct operation of the BLDC motor. The proposed method was tested by evaluating the back-EMF coefficient reconstruction as a function of some progressive failures typical of EMA motors, such as inter-turn partial shorts and rotor static eccentricity. Its robustness to external disturbances has been tested by evaluating different actuation commands and operating conditions. As expected, the back-EMF signal shows a marked dependence on the considered failure modes and, at the same time, a suitable insensitivity to the other external factors. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

"Correlation transmissibility damage indicator for deterioration performance analysis of hydropower generator unit The condition monitoring system of the hydropower generator unit (HGU) contains a vast amount of monitoring data related to equipment performance. It is challenging to reveal the HGU performance change law from these data. This paper constructed a correlation transmissibility damage indicator (CTDI) to analyze HGU degradation performance based on the transmissibility function (TF). Unlike traditional TF damage indicators, CTDI can use different types of monitoring data to obtain system TF to increase TF combination and improve detection sensitivity. The analysis is performed using actual monitoring data from a hydropower plant in Guangxi, China. Firstly, a new frequency concept is defined based on the characteristics of HGU obtaining data every 10 minutes. Then, the HGU is considered a system and divided into three subsystems according to the sensor installation locations of the monitoring system. The damage indicator is used to analyze the system and its subsystems at the time scales of day, week, and month to locate and quantify the damage of HGU. The final results of this analysis show that the method can accurately detect and locate faults, applies to different operating conditions, and reveals the HGU performance deterioration pattern, which is of great significance for HGU maintenance. © The Author(s) 2023.",2-s2.0-85147516995

"Investigations on Using Intelligent Learning Techniques for Anomaly Detection and Diagnosis in Sensors Signals in Li-Ion Battery—Case Study This research paper aims to design and implement an intelligent least short time memory (LSTM) deep learning classification technique to detect possible anomalies in measurements dataset within a particular Li-ion battery type. For the state of charge (SOC) and battery faults estimation, a Joint State and Parameter Extended Kalman Filter (JEKF) estimator is developed. The SOC accuracy performance is excellent, with less than 0.5% error during steady-state, compared to the 2% error reported in the literature. For the design and implementation of JEKF SOC and parameter estimation is chosen a preset Li-ion battery Simulink Simscape generic model. It is also helpful to generate the healthy and faulty measurement dataset to design and implement the proposed intelligent LSTM classifier deep learning technique. The generic Li-ion battery model is wisely selected for the “proof concept” purpose, model validation, and algorithms’ robustness, accuracy, and effectiveness. Compared to the traditional EKF fault diagnosis and isolation (FDI), a model-based estimation strategy, the proposed classification LSTM technique is an intelligent data-driven-based deep learning algorithm of high accuracy (around 80%) and loss performance close to zero. Therefore, this feature makes data collection of dataset measurements directly from Li-ion battery sensors possible, which is beneficial for generating online fault scenarios. Additionally, the LSTM deep learning technique can remarkably classify all detected anomalies with high accuracy, independent of battery model accuracy, uncertainties, and unmodeled dynamics. Also, high-performance accuracy root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0588 (voltage fault), approximately (Formula presented.) (healthy) and 8.87 × (Formula presented.)

"Predictive Maintenance in Industrial Machinery using Machine Learning Predictive maintenance is a proactive strategy that uses data and technology to forecast when machinery may fail. Which is important in preventing unexpected breakdowns, reducing downtime, lowering maintenance costs, and improving overall operational efficiency. When applied to gearboxes, it helps ensure their reliability, reducing unplanned downtime and extending their lifespan as Gearboxes play a critical role in various industries, and unplanned failures can lead to substantial downtime and operational losses. The project begins with a thorough study of gearbox operation, followed by the selection of appropriate sensors to monitor crucial parameters such as vibration, temperature, oil quality, and load.

"Prediction of remaining useful life for rolling bearing based on ISOMAP and multi-head self-attention with gated recurrent unit The remaining useful life of rolling element bearing affects the reliability and stability of the machine. Accurately predicting the remaining useful life of rolling element bearings is always necessary to make maintenance decisions in practical engineering. However, the remaining useful life prediction methods using traditional machine learning are incompetent for the task of training without labels, which consumes computational cost, financial resources, and labor. Therefore, a gated recurrent unit model based on feature dimensionality reduction and the multi-head self-attention mechanism (MHGRU) is established, and a homology algorithm is proposed to train the model and make the prediction. The isometric feature mapping algorithm and a homology algorithm are used in the model training, which incorporates the advantages of appreciable computational efficiency and preservation of automatic labeling for training in engineering. First, 24 basic features are extracted from the life-cycle vibration signals of rolling element bearings to reconstruct fusion features by the isometric feature mapping algorithm, which aims to reduce the feature dimension and improve computational efficiency. Since the multi-head self-attention mechanism in the MHGRU has the ability to comprehensively highlight the attention coefficient for long-term fusion features at different moments, it gives the gated recurrent unit considerable performance in reducing the computational complexity of extremely long time series and improving the accuracy of prediction results. In addition, two open-source IEEE PHM Challenge and XJTU-SY bearing datasets sampled by the sensor are adopted to assess the prediction performance of the MHGRU with homology algorithm. Finally, some existing remaining useful life prediction approaches of rolling element bearings are used for comparison. The experimental results show that MHGRU is suitable for the remaining useful life prediction of rolling element bearings and is superior to other models. © The Author(s) 2024.",2-s2.0-85200968517
"A predictive maintenance model for internet of things devices using long short-term memory and one-dimensional dilated group convolution with residual connection Predictive Maintenance (PdM) of Internet of Things (IoT) devices to enhance their reliability is becoming increasingly crucial as the IoT develops. Loss caused by malfunction can be avoided or minimized if appropriate preparations are made in advance. By summarizing the relevant literature, the use of deep learning to establish the PdM model has become a current research hotspot, but few studies use the classification method. In the multivariate time-series data produced by IoT devices, each data has a temporal and spatial correlation, so how to obtain the two correlations should be given more attention. We propose to extract temporal correlation using the Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) because it can identify long-term dependencies. To obtain spatial correlation, we propose a one-dimensional dilated group convolution with residual connection (1DDGCR) block. The residual connection in it can avoid gradients vanishing as the network deepens. Then we propose a novel PdM model for IoT equipment combining LSTM and 1DDGCR. It is named LSTM_1DDGCR. We utilize the FD001 public dataset, which is a subset of the C-MAPSS dataset, to evaluate the performance of LSTM_1DDGCR. We compare it with two models proposed by previous researchers and find that the proposed LSTM_1DDGCR model shows better performance. In addition, LSTM_1DDGCR is applied to a real-world dataset, and it also shows good performance in practical applications. © 2024 The Authors",2-s2.0-85186409176

"AFMCNN: A convolutional fusion diagnostic framework based on global distance matrix for train transmission system Sensor technology and continuously improved convolutional neural networks (CNN) are essential tools for intelligent diagnosis in train transmission systems. Numerous studies have focused on leveraging multi-sensor fusion and two-dimensional CNN to address diagnostic problems. However, research challenges remain to be addressed, such as expertise dependence and inadequate mapping when performing image coding. Additionally, many diagnostic frameworks still rely on conventional convolutional structures, constraining the extraction of features. Furthermore, the existing fusion approaches have seldom considered the issue of unbalanced distribution of diagnostic information among signals from different sources in the transmission system. To fill these research gaps, this paper proposes a global distance matrix (GDM) for image coding and an adaptive fusion multiscale CNN (AFMCNN) for multisensor fusion diagnosis in train transmission systems that can adaptively assign weights to different sensor information. First, the proposed GDM reflects the interrelationships of the time series data while preserving the temporal correlation. Then, a global attention mechanism is designed to improve the network’s attention to the global relationships of the data, considering the characteristics of the GDM. Furthermore, a novel multiscale convolution block is introduced to extract larger spatial information at different scales. Lastly, an adaptive fusion module is proposed to adaptively assign learnable weights for data from different sources at the channel dimension. The weights are visualized to increase the interpretability of the module.

"Nonlinear Parity Approach to Fault Detection in Nonlinear Systems Using Unknown Input Observer The following study presents a novel fault detection approach, based on nonlinear parity design using nonlinear unknown input observers, for a class of nonlinear systems in the presence of sensor noise. Initially, fault and noise are decoupled via splitting the system into two subsystems by a series of transformations on the states and output equations. The nonlinear unknown input observer estimates the states in the subsystem subject to sensor noise, while the states in the other subsystem are estimated with the proposed equation. The objective in this study is to ensure the asymptotic stability of the error dynamics using the Lyapunov method. Hence, the results are formulated in the form of bilinear matrix inequalities. At the same time, the nonlinear parity approach is employed to design residue signals in the subsystem subject to actuator/component faults. Sufficient conditions are established to guarantee the convergence of the state estimation error. The goal in the parity approach is to generate a specific residue indicating the difference between nominal and faulty states.

"Dynamic Thresholds for a Reliable Diagnosis of Switched Systems Safety, availability and reliability are the main concern of many industries. Thus, fault detection and isolation of industrial machines, which are in most cases switched systems, is a primary task in many companies. The presented paper proposes a new diagnostic approach for switched systems using two powerful tools: bond graph and observer. A diagnostic layer detects model errors using bond graph, and a smart algorithm identifies and locates faults using observer. Although observers serve as fault detectors, they also have their own errors caused by convergence delay of calculations; even in the case of no sensor defect, the residue does not converge to zero.

"CurrentSense: A novel approach for fault and drift detection in environmental IoT sensors Sensor data quality plays a fundamental role in increasing the adoption of IoT devices for environmental data collection. Due to the nature of the deployment, i.e., in-the-wild and in harsh environments, coupled with limitations of low-cost components, sensors are prone to failures. A significant fraction of faults result from drift and catastrophic faults in sensors' sensing components leading to serious data inaccuracies. However, it is challenging to detect faults by analyzing just the sensor data as a faulty sensor data can mimic non-faulty data and an anomalous sensor reading need not represent a faulty data. Existing data-centric approaches rely on additional contextual information or sensor redundancy to detect such faults. This paper presents a systematic approach to detect faults and drifts, by devising a novel sensor fingerprint called CurrentSense. CurrentSense captures the electrical characteristics of the hardware components in a sensor, with working, drifted, and faulty sensors having distinct fingerprints. This fingerprint is used to determine the sensors' health, and compensate for drift or diagnose catastrophic faults without any contextual information. The CurrentSense approach is non-intrusive, and can be applied to a wide variety of environmental sensors. We show the working of the proposed approach with the help of air pollution sensors. We perform an extensive evaluation in both controlled setup and real-world deployments with 51 sensors across multiple cities for 8 months period.

"Sensorized Warfighter Weapon Platforms: IoT Making the Fog of War Obsolete There is no platform or tool closer to ground-truth engagement data than the warfighter’s weapon. Weapons-based IoT sensors provide a path to harness individual engagement data into actionable intelligence insights across echelons. These IoT platforms work to provide information that will close the data gap between the individual warfighter and their command – relegating the fog of war concept to obsolescence. Weapons-based IoT sensors are uniquely positioned to fill this knowledge gap because their cost effectiveness enables deployment to every warfighter on the battlefield, turning each weapon into a new information node. Every warfighter information node can provide engagement data that includes weapon metrics such as discharge detection alerts, shot counting and ammunition remaining, weapon rates of fire, weapon orientation and directionality, and overall weapon readiness. This information represents a critical window into multiple use cases that include weapons predictive maintenance, real time situational awareness across echelons, ammunition and weapon supply chain optimization, warfighter and squad performance metrics, and ground truth historical reporting. Weapon based IoT sensors also carry unique challenges. Many deployed warfighters are burdened with gear and batteries in excess of 100 pounds. While nearly all IoT markets must rectify size, weight, and power (SWaP) constraints, weapons-based IoT sensors must resolve these issues at the extremes while remaining seamlessly integrated into a weapons platform. Sensorizing warfighter weapons provides the highest fidelity engagement data possible, but also subjects the sensors to the most diverse network conditions of any IoT sensor market segment. Network requirements range from undetectable (no RF profile) to integrating with custom, sometimes multi-national, battlefield networks to provide individual warfighter insights where necessary.

The replacement of the traditional scheduled maintenance strategy in favor of CBM has the potential to significantly improve the safety of the system operating in harsh environments of the operation and increase in productivity by prolonging the life of an asset and preventing costly breakdowns. For many years CBM remained the subject of vigorous research and discussions. Increasing the automation level and the number of sensors in industries allowed obtaining and collecting data in large amounts. The current level of computational power allows us to process and analyse this massive amount of data, which has given a new leap in the development of industrial analytics. Rather than in the case of classical knowledge-based modelling tools, data-driven methods propose modelling and forecasting frameworks based on data analysis. Consequently, the transition to the data-driven modelling gave a leap in CBM research and has recently drawn increasing attention, providing new case studies, algorithms, and results. However, technical challenges remain. Despite great flexibility and good forecasting performances, there are several limitations of data-driven algorithms. This paper provides an overview of the data-driven failure algorithms for rolling element bearings monitoring. Bearings have played a pivotal role in industrial machinery to operate with high effciency and safety. They are considered to be one of the most common machine elements of precision rotating machinery. A benchmarking of various predictive and descriptive algorithms was performed. The analysis was carried out on a dataset from the run-to-failure experiments on bearings from NASAs Data Repository. This paper also summarizes the current trends and highlights the limitations with respect to traditional knowledge-based modelling. Special attention is paid to identifying research gaps and promising research directions. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",2-s2.0-85096475078
"Identifying rotor-stator rubbing positions based on intrinsic time scale decomposition-hjorth-cepstrum To accurately locate rotor–stator rubbing faults in aero-engine, a method combining intrinsic time scale decomposition (ITD), Hjorth parameter and cepstrum analysis has been proposed. First, the method works by decomposing vibration signals from casing into proper rotation components (PRCs) based on ITD; second, calculates the autocorrelation function of each rotation component and the complexity parameters of autocorrelation functions; third, chooses PRCs for signal reconstruction according to complexity from Hjorth parameters and reconstructs the signals based on chosen PRCs; at last, considering that with different positions of rubbing, transfer paths of signals collected by the sensors from the same position are different, cepstrum analysis has been made according to reconstructed signals, and the transfer paths characteristics from cepstrum are taken as feature vectors and inputted into support vector machine for identifying the positions of rotor-stator rubbing faults. The results indicate proposed ITD-Hjorth-Cepstrum method can work well in the identification rate of training and test samples as for the identification rate for an unknown sample. © The Author(s) 2022.",2-s2.0-85123475657
"An oversampling method based on Gaussian Mixture Model for multi-bolt looseness monitoring using Lamb waves` The imbalance in the number of healthy and faulty samples poses a significant hindrance to the successful implementation of multi-bolt looseness monitoring and fault classification in engineering applications. The Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is widely used in addressing data imbalance issues. However, traditional SMOTE methods and their improvements have not taken into account the problem of sensor network signals with multiple paths. In this paper, an improved oversampling technique, namely Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-SMOTE, is introduced. The proposed SMOTE method is based on GMM and aims to solve the sample imbalance problem under different bolt states and different sensor paths in sensor networks. The GMM is utilized to cluster the minority classes in multi-bolt looseness data. The assignment of weights to different clusters is based on the clustering density function, which is subsequently followed by oversampling. The KL distance is utilized to screen the SMOTE sample data, which improves the quality of the data by achieving inter-class balance and intra-class balance. To verify the effectiveness of the method, a multi-bolt looseness monitoring procedure is implemented. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the accuracy of diagnosing early-stage bolt looseness. © The Author(s) 2024.",2-s2.0-85196320930
"Adaptive test case selection for DNN-based perception functions The progress in deep learning methods has bolstered the development of automated vehicles during the last decade. However, the deployment of deep learning methods in safety-critical applications raised questions on their safety. Like other vehicle components, a testing process has to prove the reliability of perception systems. Scalability issues arise when using real-world data to validate perception algorithms due to the immense amount of sensor data that needs to be tested. Simulation tools can complement this testing process, as they can fabricate synthetic data based on variable specifications of test cases. While simulative tools can produce a vast amount of test data, at some point, the testing process is limited by the available computing resources. Identifying test specifications that pose risks to the perception algorithms is crucial for efficiently utilizing these computing resources and estimating functional reliability. We present a pipeline for adaptive test case selection to expose the faults of a deep learning system using synthetic image data generated by a simulation framework. We apply our concept to a state-of-the-art object detector and implement multiple adaptive sampling strategies to demonstrate their ability of early fault detection. Our experiments show that our pipeline can achieve a 95% coverage of system faults while reducing the number of test executions by 90%.  © 2021 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85119092750
"CONCERN: A model-based monitoring infrastructure Characteristics such as quality, trustworthiness, and cybersecurity are becoming essential in the ecosystems of Internet of Things (IoT) systems.

"Combination of Single Channel Blind Source Separation Method and Normal Distribution for Diagnosis of Bearing Faults In most industrial environments, vibration analysis is widely used for fault diagnosis of rolling bearings. The vibration signal measured from a bearing represents a mixture of motor vibration, rolling vibration, noise, and other sources. Due to the high cost of devices and limited space, only one sensor can be installed to measure this signal. In this paper, a feature extraction method based on Single Channel Blind Source Separation (SCBSS) and Normal Distribution (ND) is proposed for vibration monitoring of rolling element bearings. To decompose the bearing signal, SCBSS is applied for separating the different sources. Because ND is sensitive to the type of fault, it is used as criterion to find an output that contains the maximum information about the fault by removing the other sources. In fact, the obtained signal contains other vibrations which affect the correct source of fault. A second SCBSS filter is, therefore, proposed to decompose the selected source and thus improves the performance of fault diagnosis. The application of the proposed method is carried out on a deep groove ball bearing with outer race fault, ball fault, and inner race fault in order to better validate the diagnosis results. © 2022 Jordan Journal of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering.

"Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection: A Hybrid Method Based on GRU-SAE and GAIN Anomaly detection in multivariate time series data has increasingly grown in importance as a result of the Industrial Internet's ongoing development. The abnormal operation condition of equipment, in particular, may result in component damage and pipeline obstruction, leakage, and other defects in the context of pump unit fault detection. Based on this, this research suggests a hybrid anomaly detection method for multidimensional time series data based on GAIN and GRU-SAE. The initial step of the method is filling up the missing data as a result of issues like sensor or communication failure using GAIN. Additionally, in contrast to conventional anomaly detection techniques, the method directly treats the reconstruction error produced by SAE as the anomaly score, removing the subjectivity of manually calculating the threshold value and simplifying the model. The proposed method is then used to the pump dataset for the identification of pump faults, and the experiments reveal that it outperforms other methods in terms of Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC, and other performance evaluation metrics.  © 2023 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85152764174
"Robust sliding mode observer design for simultaneous fault reconstruction in perturbed Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems using non-quadratic stability analysis Appearing faults in a practical system is dispensable, and if it is not compensated, it results in poor system performance or even dysfunction of the system. The fault detection has become a promising challenging issue to guarantee the safety and reliability of systems. In this paper, a novel fuzzy-based sliding mode observer for the simultaneous actuator and sensor fault reconstruction of nonlinear systems subjected to external disturbance is proposed. The proposed approach employs the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model, sliding mode observer and non-quadratic Lyapunov function. First, by filtering the system output, a fictitious system whose actuator faults are the original actuator and sensor faults is constructed. Then, by considering the (Formula presented.) performance criteria, the effect of disturbance on the state estimations is minimized. It is proved that the estimations asymptotically converge to their actual values for non-perturbed systems. In the process of designing the observer gains, some transformation matrices are obtained by solving linear matrix inequalities. The proposed approach has some superiority over the existing methods. First, considering the non-quadratic Lyapunov function leads to relaxed results and good estimation performance. Second, using the sliding mode observer makes the proposed approach insensitive to the uncertainties and unknown inputs and determines the shape and size of the fault. Third, assuming the premise variables are immeasurable makes the presented approach more applicable. In conclusion, two practical systems are considered and simulation results illustrate the merits of the proposed approach in comparison with the recent methods from the fast and precise fault detection performance viewpoints. © The Author(s) 2020.",2-s2.0-85077631876
"Improving the reliability of hydraulic systems of technological machines Modern technological machines have in their design hydraulic systems that are used to control the working body of the machine. Currently, hydraulic systems are complex systems that consist of a large number of subsystems and separately functioning elements. An analysis of the reasons leading to the failure of hydraulic systems shows that their reliability depends on a large number of factors, which are often interconnected. These factors include the external influence of the environment, the properties of materials and working hydraulic fluid, wear processes, the magnitude of the loads, the operating time, as well as regulations for the maintenance of the hydraulic system as a whole and its individual elements. As the statistics of hydraulic systems failure show, about sixty percent of failures are associated with contamination of the working fluid. It is possible to prevent contamination of the hydraulic system at the design stage or by changing the organization of maintenance. It is shown that the number of sensors registering the level of contamination of the hydraulic fluid and their placement on the machine body must be scientifically substantiated. The studies presented in the article allow us to make a conclusion about the possible formation of stagnant zones in remote nodes of the hydraulic system. An important result of this research is that dynamic data collected by the built-in particle detection sensors can give inaccurate information about the condition of the hydraulic fluid. Evaluation of modern methods of technical operation has made it possible to identify a priority condition that will allow the transition from diagnostic to predictive assessment of the state of elements of hydraulic systems of technological machines.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",2-s2.0-85098050168
"Efficient vibration analysis system using empirical mode decomposition residual signal and multi-axis data The empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method is a technique that recursively decomposes an input signal into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by residual signals, primarily for identifying desirable features. The suggested algorithm observes the residual signal instead of the IMF, which lowers the computing load. The study introduces a new method for detecting bearing faults by enhancing signal extraction from sensor data using EMD and multi-axis feature extraction. This method streamlines the process by filtering out high-frequency noise and correlating residual signal information with analysis. The approach also enhances the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and feature signature identification using digital signal processing (DSP) techniques. The algorithm for vibration data analysis is tested for bearing failures, identifying shaft frequency and inner race bearing faults, which can be implemented in parallel. For the inner race fault bearing analysis, two-level EMD with a residual signal generates output similar to five-iteration EMD, saving 60% of computations. The use of spectral multiplication to multi-axis data processing produced a rise in the SNR of 18.32 dB to 20.92 dB for Y-axis and X-axis input, respectively. When compared to the single-axis IMF data computation, 20% fewer iterations are needed overall. A single-level EMD is adequate for calculating the rotational frequency of a healthy bearing. For the Y- and X-axis input, multi-axis analysis increases SNR by 10.68 dB and 13.14 dB, accordingly. This comprehensive strategy reduces computational complexity, improves fault detection accuracy, and minimizes noise impact, making it a promising solution for bearing fault detection. © The Author(s) 2024.",2-s2.0-85199988241
"Deep Learning-Based Faults Detection and Classification in Photovoltaic Systems Using Voltage and Current Images There is a significant growth in the use of solar photovoltaics (PV) for clean and sustainable renewable energy. The ease of installation and expansion of PV power plants makes them suitable for grid-connected operation. However, increasing the size of the PV power plant will make it difficult to detect and classify faults, which leads to lower system efficiency and reliability. Therefore, this article proposes a method for detecting and classifying faults in PV systems in order to fix them more quickly and efficiently. For this purpose, the data of current and voltage are collected from every panel for a period of time in normal case and for three common fault types (open circuit, short circuit, and shading), and afterwards converted into wavelet transform images. Then a deep learning approach is used to detect, classify, and locate defective panels in a PV system. The obtained results show that the deep learning approach based on Resnet50, and voltage images was 100% accurate compared to the deep learning approach based on current images. In this methodology there is no need for additional sensors since they are embedded with panels and sent to main computer. Since the voltage parameter has the best accuracy scenario, it is converted to images, then ResNet-50 is applied. So, every panel can be detected and classified, and as each panel is numbered, the fault location can be readily determined. © 2024, Tafila Technical University.

"nCare: Fault-aware edge intelligence for rendering viable sensor nodes In remote sensor nodes, energy harvesters are used with rechargeable batteries as the power source. As these batteries undergo capacitance reduction, they degrade with each charge–discharge cycle. Most of the existing researches do not consider edge-based computation for battery health prediction. This paper proposes a smart, accurate, and reliable data-driven architecture, nCare, to predict the battery's health at low power and low computation costs. Three models are used for health prediction, two Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) models deployed at the sensor node — one to predict the State of Health (SoH) of the battery for the first few cycles and the second to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of battery. An AutoKeras model deployed at the gateway where it will be trained using the first 200 cycles. Then weight matrix and layer information will be sent to sensor nodes to replicate the model without training to predict SoH after 200 cycles. Two main parameters, battery temperature and elapsed time (ET), are used to predict the SoH, which is further used for RUL prediction. Furthermore, to prove the efficiency of the RUL prediction method, the calculated Absolute Error (AE), Relative Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Relative error (RE) are 0.019, 0.142, and 0.005, respectively for a battery of 730 cycles. This method helps the sensor node acquire intelligence that will be battery specific. Blockchain is used for maintaining the data integrity of the architecture. nCare thus ensures an effective and accurate solution for predicting the RUL of a battery. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2-s2.0-85142882450

"A novel information fusion approach using weighted neural networks for intelligent multi-class diagnostics of rotating machinery with unseen working conditions Analytical diagnostics tools have been proved effective. However, these techniques are unable to be adaptively implemented for diverse machines with various defect modes. Big data-based diagnostics tools have been demonstrated efficient, but they exploit massive data with a high computational cost and time that is impractical for online condition monitoring. Furthermore, the health signals may be acquired under unseen working conditions in real machines. These are the major challenges for previous diagnostics methods and make them infeasible in real-world applications. So, a novel technique is proposed in this research to solve mentioned problems.

The protocol has an intrusion detection mechanism, which can detect the attack of malicious nodes in time synchronization. Aiming at the small deviation of slow attack and the problem of time synchronization error, information fusion is based on the quality principle, and according to the time synchronization information of different nodes, we make random weighted average correction for local time nodes. The simulation results show that the fits time synchronization protocol has good intrusion detection and fault tolerance capability. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",2-s2.0-85082628563

"Fault Sensor Detection and Authentication Mechanism for Improving Quality of Services in Smart Homes Smart city improves the welfare of the citizens using information and communication technology. The Smart city also helps to increase the efficiency of government operations as well as the quality of government operations. Smart homes are an integral component of a smart city, empowering individual home owners to contribute a sustainable and livable urban environment. A Smart home uses various Internet of Things (IoT) sensors. Sensors are critical components of the system because they collect valuable informations and the accompanying communication networks that convey the data in real-time. The precise values measured by sensors indicate the sort of regulating measure that must be done. Malfunction will likely lead to a fluctuation in the measured value of sensors, which will have an impact on the smart home’s overall optimization. It is therefore essential to determine if all of the sensors attached to a smart home system are functioning properly as a result of this. Furthermore, the data measured from the sensor must be confirmed to ensure that it is received from the actual device. Data hacking by another device may cause unintended complications. Thus, in this chapter, we propose a fault sensor detection and authentication mechanism for improving the quality of services in smart homes. This chapter presents a fault identification mechanism of various sensors that help to resolve the fault and get the proper and enough information for various services. Further, our chapter validates the data source which helps to improve the data integrity. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",2-s2.0-85189083746
"A novel machine learning pipeline to detect malicious anomalies for the Internet of Things Anomaly detection is an imperative problem in the field of the Internet of Things (IoT). The anomalies are considered as samples that do not follow a normal pattern and significantly differ from the expected values. There can be numerous reasons an IoT sensor data is anomalous. For example, it can be due to abnormal events, IoT sensor faults, or malicious manipulation of data generated from IoT devices. There has been wide-scale research done on anomaly detection problems in general, i.e., finding the samples in data that differ significantly from the expected values. However, there has been limited work done to figure out the inherent cause of the anomalies in IoT sensor data. Accordingly, once an abnormal data sample has been observed, the challenge of detecting whether the anomaly is due to an abnormal event or IoT sensor data manipulation by an attacker has not been explored in detail. In this paper, rather than finding the typical anomalies, we propose a method to detect malicious anomalies. The given paper puts forward an idea of where anomalies in IoT can be categorized into different types. Consequently, rather than finding an anomalous sample point, our method filters only malicious anomalies in the measured IoT data. Initially, we provide an attack model for the IoT sensor data and show how the model can affect the decision-making abilities of IoT-based applications by introducing malicious anomalies. Further, we design a novel Machine Learning (ML) based method to detect these malicious anomalies. Our ML method is inspired by ensemble machine learning and uses threshold and aggregation methods rather than the traditional methods of output aggregation in ensemble learning. The proposed ML architecture is tested using pollutant, telemetry, and vehicular traffic data obtained from the state of California. Simulation results show that our architecture performs with a decent accuracy for various sizes of malicious anomalies. In particular, by setting the parameters of the anomaly detector, the precision, recall, and F-score values of 93%, 94%, and 93% are obtained; i.e., a well-balance between all three metrics. By varying model parameters either precision or recall value can be increased further at the cost of other showing that the model is tunable to meet the application requirement. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2-s2.0-85138088580
"A hierarchical deep learning framework for combined rolling bearing fault localization and identification with data fusion Fault diagnosis of rolling bearings becomes an important research subject, where the data-driven deep learning-based techniques have been extensively exploited. While the state-of-the-art research has shown the substantial progresses in bearing fault diagnosis, they mostly were implemented upon the hypothesis that the location of bearing prone to failure already is known. Nevertheless, in actual practice many rolling bearings are installed in a complex machinery system, any of which is likely subject to fault. As such, fault diagnosis essentially is a process to achieve both fault localization and identification, which results in many fault scenarios to be handled. This will significantly degrade the fault diagnosis performance using conventional deep learning analysis. In this research, we aim to develop a new deep learning framework to address abovementioned challenge. We particularly design a hierarchical deep learning framework consisting of multiple sequentially deployed deep learning models built upon the transfer learning. This can improve the learning adequacy for a high-dimensional problem with many fault scenarios involved even under limited dataset, thereby enhancing the fault diagnosis performance. Without the prior knowledge regarding the fault location, this methodology is greatly favored by the sensor/data fusion which takes full advantage of the enriched pivot fault-related features in the measurements acquired from different accelerometers. Systematic case studies using the publicly accessible experimental rolling bearing dataset are carried out to validate this new methodology. © The Author(s) 2022.",2-s2.0-85128885648
"Data-Driven Digital Twin for Intelligent Energy Optimization in Partially Shaded PV Systems In the digital era, Digital Twins (DTs) have emerged as a crucial tool for real-time optimization of photovoltaic (PV) system performance. Partial shading remains a major challenge, significantly reducing energy output in PV systems. This paper presents a novel methodology to enhance per-day energy extraction (PDEE) from PV systems under partial shading conditions. The approach involves two key steps: (1) Developing a Digital Twin framework for the PV system using real-world sensor data (voltage, current, temperature, and irradiance) for model training and calibration, enabling accurate online power estimation while reducing the reliance on physical sensors. (2) Integrating auxiliary (biased) sources in series with each partially shaded PV array to regulate the Global Maximum Power Point Tracking (GMPPT) voltage across all parallel-connected PV arrays, ensuring optimal power extraction. A digital twin of the single-diode PV model is constructed using a precise mathematical representation, with parameters estimated via deep neural networks (DNNs) optimized by the Modified Harris Hawks Optimization (MHHO) algorithm. While essential measurements such as temperature and irradiance are retained for real-time estimation, validation, and fault detection, the Digital Twin serves as an intelligent virtual replica of the physical PV system, significantly reducing reliance on extensive sensor networks. Additionally, a machine learning model, trained on features derived from the digital twin, is employed to predict the voltage at GMPPT accurately. Experimental validations and simulations demonstrate that the proposed methodology enhances power extraction by 15.86% under partial shading conditions. This approach offers a practical and effective solution for improving energy harvesting efficiency and mitigating the impact of partial shading in real-world PV applications. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Shiraz University 2025.",2-s2.0-105010772310
"Enabling predictive and preventive maintenance using iot and big data in the telecom sector Telecom sector has always been working hard to improve network quality to satisfy end user services. Fixing telecom network errors (hardware and software) precisely and quickly is a main factor to improve quality of services.

"Plane vibration features and degradation history modeling for rotating machinery remaining useful life prediction The ease of using sensors and collecting data provides a great support for industry reliability. Rolling bearings are indispensable components in various machinery systems, and accurately predicting their remaining useful life (RUL) is crucial for ensuring equipment safety and reliability through prognostic health maintenance (PHM). While traditional methods primarily rely on analyzing vibration signals for degradation modeling, they often miss out on crucial insights embedded in planar vibration patterns. In our research, we propose a groundbreaking approach that utilizes planar vibration analysis to capture a comprehensive range of degradation information. We introduce planar vibration features (PVF) which are derived from analyzing the scattering of acceleration vectors on a 2D plane. These PVFs reveal significant correlations with RUL. Meanwhile, unlike conventional methods that rely on single timestamps or windowed samples, our proposed model harnesses the power of multilayer convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn from the entire degradation history. To tackle the challenge of early-stage uncertainty, we have devised a weighted mean square error metric. Through validation on the PHM2012 challenge dataset, our approach demonstrates superior accuracy compared to recent methods for RUL prediction. This research sheds light on the importance of capturing multidirectional vibration information for effective RUL prediction, thereby offering a promising avenue for advancing machinery prognostics and maintenance practices. © The Author(s) 2025.",2-s2.0-105004922952

"Using Functionally Redundant Inertial Measurement Units to Increase Reliability and Ensure Fault Tolerance This paper aims to assess the possibility of using functionally redundant inertial units to solve problems of increasing reliability and ensuring the fault tolerance of the various classes and purposes of aircraft navigation systems. We present the results of studying failure detection methods to improve the accuracy and reliability of a strapdown functionally redundant inertial unit. The resulting structural redundancy of the strapdown inertial measurement unit is designed to increase the fault tolerance and accuracy of strapdown inertial navigation systems. The methods for detecting sensor failures in functionally redundant inertial units are based on the use of the equations of functionally redundant inertial unit compliance to nominal requirements for the accuracy of measuring the input action vector. To describe the methods for detecting and eliminating failed sensor and algorithm designs based on them, we gave the mathematical models of the measurement vector of functionally redundant inertial units concerning the measured vector and the error identification condition, including the residual of the matching equations with the size due to the level of redundancy, determining the total number of matching equations. The main criterion for determining a failed sensor is non-compliance with the nominal value of the residual included in a certain number of matching equations of the information received from such meters. The developed algorithms are examined using simulation methods. The study of the selected structure of the functionally redundant inertial units shows that the proposed approaches are efficient. Also, we manage to identify the main characteristics of the algorithms for detecting sensor failures that are structurally a part of the functionally redundant inertial units. © 2023 by the authors.",2-s2.0-85180681263
"Open-Source Data Logger System for Real-Time Monitoring and Fault Detection in Bench Testing This paper presents the design and development of a proof of concept (PoC) open-source data logger system for wireless data acquisition via Wi-Fi aimed at bench testing and fault detection in combustion and electric engines. The system integrates multiple sensors, including accelerometers, microphones, thermocouples, and gas sensors, to monitor critical parameters, such as vibration, sound, temperature, and CO2 levels. These measurements are crucial for detecting anomalies in engine performance, such as ignition and combustion faults. For combustion engines, temperature sensors detect operational anomalies, including diesel engines operating beyond the normal range of 80 °C to 95 °C and gasoline engines between 90 °C and 110 °C. These readings help identify failures in cooling systems, thermostat valves, or potential coolant leaks. Acoustic sensors identify abnormal noises indicative of issues such as belt misalignment, valve knocking, timing irregularities, or loose parts. Vibration sensors detect displacement issues caused by engine mount failures, cracks in the engine block, or defects in pistons and valves. These sensors can work synergistically with acoustic sensors to enhance fault detection. Additionally, CO2 and organic compound sensors monitor fuel combustion efficiency and detect failures in the exhaust system. For electric motors, temperature sensors help identify anomalies, such as overloads, bearing problems, or excessive shaft load. Acoustic sensors diagnose coil issues, phase imbalances, bearing defects, and faults in chain or belt systems. Vibration sensors detect shaft and bearing problems, inadequate motor mounting, or overload conditions. The collected data are processed and analyzed to improve engine performance, contributing to reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and enhanced energy efficiency. This PoC system leverages open-source technology to provide a cost-effective and versatile solution for both research and practical applications.

"Simultaneous Fault Detection and Control Design for Linear Fractional-Order Systems The focus of this paper is the analysis and design scheme of simultaneous fault detection and control (SFDC) for linear continuous-time fractional-order systems assumed to be affected by sensor, actuator and process faults as well as disturbances. In essence, this simultaneous design unifies both the control and the detection modules into a single unit that is called the controller/detector unit. This unit is designed such that it generates two signals, namely the residual and the control signals. The system can be stabilized using the control signal, and the residual signals can detect the fault based on model-based fault detection and isolation algorithms. The SFDC module should be designed so that the effects of faults and disturbances on the residual signals are maximized and minimized, respectively. To this end, the SFDC problem is formulated as the mixed H-/ H∞ optimization problem. Stability and fault detection are both considered through certain performance indices, and new sufficient conditions in the form of linear matrix inequalities are obtained.

"Artificial Intelligence of Things Induced Predictive Maintenance of Computer Numerical Control Machine Automatically predictive maintenance (PdM) is critical for minimizing unplanned downtime and reducing operational costs in modern computer numerical control machines. However, traditional cloud-based PdM suffers from high latency, privacy concerns, and heavy infrastructure demands; meanwhile, traditional edge intelligence-based approaches are restricted by the power of edge devices. In order to tackle these issues, this paper proposes a transferable TinyML-based Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) for PdM. First, self-powered piezoelectric sensors in the AIoT are installed for monitoring device vibration. Second, FFT-based feature extraction and quantized TinyML models are deployed on the edge device for real-time, low-power inference on microcontrollers.

"Machine learning based meta-models for sensorless thermal load prediction Lifetime of electronic systems depends various factors determined during product development stage, e.g. design, materials, quality of components and manufacturing. In the field, the load of the system leads to degradation affects the remaining useful life of the product. In this work, we focus on thermal load conditions. The thermal load is induced externally by ambient temperature and internally due to heat generated by operation of components. In most consumer use cases external load is a constant room temperature. In industry, e.g. automotive or aviation, the external load shows strong fluctuation and appears in cycles. The heat loss during operation causes superposition of internal and external thermal loads distributed over the system. Our goal is to create a meta-model that allows the calculation of temperature at various points of interest in the system based on virtual sensors in these points. The model is trained based on experimental data with attached thermal sensors in the points of interest. A temperature chamber provides ambient temperature cycles in a range of -50 to 50 °C, resulting in maximum CPU temperatures of 95 °C. A program running on the system stresses the CPU of the system to certain load levels. These load levels cause heat loss in the CPU, which is distributed to the system. The results are time series for the CPU load, CPU temperature, ambient temperature and temperatures of the attached thermos couples. We test several mathematical and machine learning approach to obtain the temperature in the points of interest, which are the outputs of the models. CPU load, ambient temperature (and in some cases CPU temperature) serve as inputs. In further research attempts, we run the experiment to failure of components. Based on these data, models can be extended to calculate the remaining useful life of the system. © 2021 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85125346003
"Inaccessible rolling bearing diagnosis using a novel criterion for Morlet wavelet optimization The objective of this research is to diagnose an inaccessible rolling bearing by indirect vibration measurement. In this study, a shaft supported with several bearings is considered. It is assumed that the vibration for at least one bearing is not recordable. The purpose is to diagnose inaccessible bearing by the recorded data from the sensors located on the other bearings. To achieve this goal, the continuous wavelet transform is used to detect weak signatures in the available vibration signals. A new criterion for adjusting the scale parameter of continuous wavelet transform is proposed based on the amplitude of the bearing characteristic frequencies. In this criterion, the optimal scale is selected to maximize the amplitude of bearing characteristic frequencies in comparison with the amplitude of the other frequencies. The results of the proposed method are compared with a popular method, energy-to-entropy ratio criterion, using two different sets of run-to-failure experimental data. Results indicate that the proposed method in this article is more effective and efficient for extracting the weak signatures and diagnosing inaccessible bearings from the recorded vibration signals. © The Author(s) 2021.",2-s2.0-85100974457
"IoT-based expert system for fault detection in Japanese Plum leaf-turgor pressure WSN Industry 4.0 involves the digital transformation of industrial sectors. Given the current climate change scenario and the scarcity of water in semi-arid regions, this digital transformation has to take into account the sustainable use of water. In agriculture, one of the most water-intensive sectors, to optimise the use of water, precision irrigation techniques are being applied. As a result of the digital transformation of agriculture, a key aspect for the application of these precision irrigation techniques, the crop water stress, can be predicted from a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) of leaf-turgor pressure sensors. However, these sensors often fail, introducing errors in the data, which could lead to inaccurate application of precision irrigation techniques compromising crops and yields. So, sensor fault identification is a must. Nevertheless, sensor fault identification is a tedious and costly task that requires an expert to manually review all sensors and each of their measurements over the last 24 h.

"Investigation on low velocity impact damage identification with ultrasonic techniques under different sensor network conditions Direct or indirect damages due to foreign object impacts on aeronautical structures, represent a major concern. The problem potentially intensifies with the adoption of composite materials, especially due to Barely Visible Impact Damage (BVID). In this context, understanding whether an impact event gives rise to delamination or debonding is highly desirable in view of the optimization of the maintenance strategies and, at the same time, of the safety margins associated to the operation of the structures. One possible method to achieve this goal is that of integrating damage monitoring systems within the vehicle architecture itself. By doing so, in fact, the enhanced structural health state awareness allows the implementation of Predictive Maintenance philosophies and the possibility to detect damage with size/severity and indentation smaller than the BVID currently applied by design and certification. In this work, a simple and a stiffened carbon fiber panel are subjected to Low Velocity Impacts using falling masses to generate a structural damage.

In this article, we present a diagnosis method for nonlinear dynamical systems, called sparse recovery diagnosis, based on a dynamical algorithm that estimates a sparse fault vector from few system measurements. The term sparse means that many faults can be considered, but only few of them can occur simultaneously.

"IoT-Driven Bayesian Learning: A Case Study of Reducing Road Accidents of Commercial Vehicles on Highways Majority of the recorded accidents are adjudged preventable following analysis of circumstances behind such accidents. The causes have been traced to factors like bad tires, bad roads, failed breaks, negligence on adhering to driving rules, poor vehicle maintenance habits, overloading, over speeding, etc. In developing countries, commercial vehicles are mostly affected. In Nigeria alone, the Federal Roads Safety Commission (FRSC) in 2017 reported that more than 2000 accidents were recorded in the major highways. Following the ugly trend, speed limiters were promoted, lobbied, and approved by the relevant authorities. Whereas much emphasis is laid on speed, not much attention is paid to how bad roads relate to road accidents. It is pertinent to assert that road users unfamiliar with such roads could exhibit some momentary psychological shifts, which could predispose to incapacity in maneuvering events that could cause accidents.

"Speed Sensorless Fault Tolerant Control for DC Servo Motor with Current Sensor Fault – This paper discusses the application of a fault tolerant control scheme in sensorless speed control for dc motors. The sensorless speed system works by estimating the speed using the current measurement value. The novelty of the proposed scheme is a speed estimator capable of accommodating current sensor faults, which is the only measurement information. The technique used is a modification of the Extended State Observer (ESO) where the residual is not only used to estimate the state, but also to estimate the load torque. In this case, the load torque is treated as a changing input parameter and it is estimated using the observer's normal approach. The modified ESO estimation result is in the form of speed and current estimate, and then fed to the state feedback control with the integrator in order to maintain the speed at the setpoint value. In order to test the proposed control system, numerical simulations are carried out and comparisons are made between the control system with ESO and with modified ESO.

The design of three observers, respectively, corresponding to the above sub-systems, the actuator faults, sensor faults as well as the unknown input disturbances are reconstructed separately as a result. Two simulation examples confirm the truth of effectiveness of the reconstruction plan. © 2021 Acta Press. All rights reserved.",2-s2.0-85116457101
"A NOVEL INTELLIGENT FAULT OBSERVER TO DIAGNOSE ACTUATOR FAULT AND SENSOR NOISE BASED ON PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS This paper aims to bridge the gap between classic model base observer and intelligent observer based on the model base and probability distributions to monitor the plant which is affected by actuator fault and sensor noise simultaneously. The paper includes the implementing and designing of two new optimal actuator observers which also relies on two optimal theories. The first new optimal actuator fault observer is a model base observer based on Lyapunov conditions while, the novelty of the second optimal actuator observer comes from introducing a fault diagnosis algorithm based on a sequential sampling filter (SSF) as a prominent part of the algorithm to filter the diagnosed fault in using the rules of the algorithm. The filters depend on the likelihood ratio, which consists of two hypothetical distributions; the target distribution and the sampling distribution. The new intelligent observer has given rise to innovative algorithms in the field of fault detection and diagnose observer. Moreover, the algorithms verify Lyapunov conditions. In addition, to demonstrate the integrity of the observers, a comparison has been made in the presence of white sensor noise, which is the main reason for inaccurate measurement in addition to two types of actuator faults; Gaussian and non-Gaussian. The study used to verify the performance, where two physical and relative error criteria have been used to evaluate the performance. However, the simulation results appear the flexibility of the second observer to diagnose the actuator fault with sensor noise together due to the number of parameters in diagnosing rules and parameters of the two probabilities. © 2024 Acta Press.

"Fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control for T-S fuzzy time-varying delay stochastic distribution systems with actuator and sensor faults The problem of fault diagnosis (FD) and fault-tolerant control (FTC) for a class of nonlinear time-varying delay stochastic distribution control (SDC) systems with actuator and sensor faults is investigated in this paper. The Takagi–Sugeno (T-S) model is used to approximate the nonlinear dynamics. The B-spline function is used to approximate the output probability density function (PDF) of the system. According to the output equivalence principle and Laplace transformation, an augmented state vector is designed to solve the time-varying delay problem. An augmented state adaptive diagnosis observer is proposed to estimate the system state, actuator and sensor faults simultaneously. A new fault-tolerant control algorithm is designed based on the PI control strategy to compensate sensor fault and actuator faults simultaneously. The sensor fault is compensated through the information obtained by the observer. The PI controller can compensate for the influence of the actuator fault, and the output PDF of system can still track the desired PDF when fault occurs. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2-s2.0-85100744458
"Ensemble machine learning for intelligent condition monitoring Traditionally, the maintenance process in engineering has been a costly and time-consuming process that requires large amounts of resources and capital. Condition-based maintenance is a maintenance strategy that aims to reduce maintenance-related expenses and disruptions in industrial processes by performing maintenance only when necessary. Condition-based maintenance seeks to reduce equipment downtime by monitoring the actual condition of a machine, so that maintenance is only conducted right before the point of failure so that organizations get the maximum value possible from their machines. Because condition-based maintenance is very data-driven, it is a prime contender for a process that can be enhanced by the application of machine learning. In this paper we propose an ensemble machine learning model that combines the random forest, support vector machine, and artificial neural network classifiers to classify time-series data from sensors monitoring the condition of bearings into normal and faulty categories. If a data point is classified as faulty, the fault is diagnosed into one of the following categories: outer race, inner race, or roller element. By combining previous strengths with new ideas, this paper presents an intelligent condition monitoring model that is capable of accurately identifying and classifying faults in time-series condition data. The efficacy of the model in adequately detecting and diagnosing faults in machines is discussed, and an illustrative example is given to show the application of the model. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden 2024.",2-s2.0-85198049441
"Enhancement of Jaibot: Developing Safety and Monitoring Features for Jaibot Using IoT Technologies The Hilti Jaibot, a state-of-the-art construction site drilling robot, has demonstrated remarkable productivity gains while also underscoring the need for improved safety and monitoring capabilities. This study aims to address this need by harnessing Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and predictive maintenance methodologies. The proposed enhancements encompass a comprehensive sensor and camera integration to monitor the robot's environment, coupled with the development of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) predictive maintenance algorithm to preemptively identify operational issues. These improvements enable the Jaibot to autonomously detect and mitigate risks, such as obstacles and human activity, while providing real-time safety alerts to operators. Incorporating quantitative results from our predictive model, which successfully predicts three output variables (X, Y, and Z) using three input variables, we observed varying RMSE and MAPE values. Specifically, X exhibited an RMSE of 77.80% and a MAPE of 242.20%, while Y showed an RMSE of 31.10% and a MAPE of 69.70%, and Z had an RMSE of 34.53% and a MAPE of 82.74%. Notably, Y and Z data displayed high MAPE values, potentially attributed to data inconsistency. To enhance accuracy in our predictive model, we propose the utilization of more complex models and increased data volumes, which may mitigate the observed inconsistencies and lead to improved overall model performance. These findings from our quantitative analysis provide valuable insights for the integration of predictive maintenance algorithms into the Hilti Jaibot and lay the foundation for future advancements in robotic construction, emphasizing the pivotal role of IoT technology and predictive maintenance in shaping the industry's trajectory. © (2023).

"Research on Local Fault Diagnosis of Rotary Vector Reducer Based on Motor Current Signature Analysis The rotary vector (RV) reducer, as a highly precise transmission mechanism, can lead to a series of consequential hazards when experiencing local faults. Conducting corresponding research on performance monitoring and fault diagnosis holds significant importance. In order to achieve higher diagnostic accuracy, better classification, prediction effect, and less use of sensors, this paper proposes a local fault diagnosis method of RV reducer based on Motor current signature analysis (MCSA). Firstly, the centre gear local fault electromechanical coupling model is created by combining the working principle of the servo motor, the working characteristics of the RV reducer, and the influencing factors of motor current. Then, according to the actual operating conditions of industrial robots (IRs), the corresponding experimental platform is designed and constructed, and current signals in four different modes are collected. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) is performed on the current signals to obtain frequency domain features, and the correctness of the local fault coupling model of the centre gear is experimentally verified. Finally, the time-domain statistical features, time–frequency domain features, and CNN features of servo-feedback current signals under different rotational speeds are extracted and used in the implementation of local fault diagnosis for the RV reducer, respectively. In this paper, it is confirmed that MCSA can be used for localized fault diagnosis of the RV reducer, and combined with a deep learning network, it can effectively predict the fault modes with an average accuracy of more than 96%. © 2024 Heng Li et al.",2-s2.0-86000103418

"Learning methods for structural damage detection via entropy-based sensors selection In this article the problem of data-driven structural damage detection is considered exploiting historical data collected from a structure. First, a novel technique based on Kalman filtering and on a combination of regression trees theory from machine learning and auto-regressive system identification from control theory is derived to build switching models that can be used to detect structural damages. A technique is also proposed leveraging principal component analysis together with the poly-exponential approach to create nonlinear models to be used for structural damage detection.

"Research on motor fault recognition based on multi-sensor fusion With the rapid development of new energy and power technology, motors are widely used in daily life. The fault recognition of motor can effectively reduce the economic loss and the threat to personnel safety. In recent years, motor fault detection based on deep learning has made remarkable achievements. But these methods only use one modality, such as voltage or current signals. However, multi-modal information fusion can make full use of the complementarity between different modes to effectively improve performance. To this end, this paper proposes a new deep network to leverage multi-modal fusion for motor fault recognition. Specifically, we use different sensors to simultaneously collect the sequence signals, including voltage, current and vibration signals. To explore the relationship of intra-modality, we design a Transformer-based deep model by exploiting the multi-head attention mechanism. To mine the inter-modality relationships, we use the cross-attention mechanism. All the experimental results show that the performance of the proposed deep model is better than other deep sequence models in motor fault detection. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2-s2.0-85152801132

"A classification and prediction model with the sparrow search-probabilistic neural network algorithm for transformer fault diagnosis We present a fault prediction model for transformers to improve the accuracy of transformer fault (TF) prediction. The model is predicated on a probabilistic neural network (PNN) that is optimised using three gas ratios with the help of the sparrow search algorithm (SSA). First, we monitor real-time gas concentrations and calculate the essential gas ratio by installing a smart gas sensor inside the transformer. The PNN is optimised by using the SSA algorithm. Subsequently, a mapping model between gas ratios and fault types is established. At last, we assess the model’s prediction performance by calculating the mean square error. The results we got demonstrate that this method achieves a prediction accuracy of 90%, which is superior to the back propagation (BP) network, the k-nearest neighbour (KNN), and the support vector machine (SVM).

"Fault Estimation and Fault-Tolerant Control of Multiple Faults and Uncertain Disturbances Based on Generalized Sliding Mode Method Measuring element is always accompanied by uncertainty disturbances and multiple faults during the long time operation of industrial system in complex environment such as blade and pitch system of floating wind turbines. Timely detection of the fault and fault-tolerant control (FTC) perform a significant part in ensuring the stable operation of the system and saving maintenance fees. Sliding mode control is extensively applied to FTC because of its good robustness. Therefore, a sliding mode controller is constructed to guarantee the stability of the industrial plant which suffers multiple faults and uncertain disturbances. At the same time, most existing literature does not take into account several faults and uncertain disturbances. Firstly, employing generalized sliding mode method, we devise a sliding mode observer for evaluating state vector, actuator fault and sensor fault of the system. Secondly, according to the state estimation, we construct a sliding mode controller and prove its validity by Lyapunov's theorem. Our controller achieves satisfactory performance, and it is easier to be implemented in practical engineering than other controllers. Finally, we establish a SIMULINK model of blade and pitch system and make simulation experiments. Simulation outcomes validate the availability and practicability of our controller, which also provides a general scheme for fault estimation and FTC of other industrial plants. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2-s2.0-85212394862

"Disturbance estimation for robotic systems using continuous integral sliding mode observer This article presents a novel force-sensor-less method for the estimation of external forces for a general class of second-order robotic systems. The method is based on the integral sliding mode observer (ISMO) which serves as a second-order differentiator for the position measurement of the system. As a result, the system states and disturbance are estimated without explicitly using force and velocity measurements. To apply the ISMO to the general second-order systems, a proper assumption is proposed to address their nonlinearity and discontinuity. The boundary-layer method is applied to ensure that the virtual inputs of the observer are continuous such that the chattering phenomenon is attenuated. A Lyapunov-based method is used to analyze the influence of the boundary layers on the convergence of the state- and disturbance-estimation errors. This influence, mainly determined by the boundary-layer scalars, is given in analytical forms as a reference for parameter selection. The method is evaluated by numerical simulation on a robot manipulator system and compared with a conventional sliding mode observer (SMO). The validation of the performance of the continuous ISMO indicates its generalizability to general second-order robotic systems. Also, the advantage of continuous ISMO over the conventional SMO is reflected by its small estimation errors and superior responsiveness. In general, the proposed method in this paper may interest those who are seeking solutions for haptic robotic tasks without using force sensors. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2-s2.0-85133098718

"Optimal robust fault detection of discrete-time LPV systems with measurement error-affected scheduling variables combining ZKF and pQP Optimal robust state estimation (SE) and fault detection (FD) methods of discrete-time linear parameter varying systems with measurement error-affected scheduling variables are proposed under the boundedness assumption of system uncertainties. By using the weighted Frobenius norm of the generator matrix of SE zonotope to characterize the set size, the optimal observer gain can be computed by a zonotopic Kalman filter (ZKF) procedure for the purpose of observation. Meanwhile, by minimizing the influence of system uncertainties while maximizing that of faults on SE to enhance the sensitivity of FD, the optimal FD criterion is characterized based on an on-line fractional programming problem, which can be equivalently transformed into a parametric quadratic programming (pQP) problem. The pQP problem can be efficiently solved by searching the root of its nonlinear characteristic equation using secant method. In general, as long as sensors with sufficiently high precision are equipped to measure the scheduling variables, the bounds of measurement errors of scheduling variables can be less conservative than those direct bounds of scheduling variables, which can reduce the conservatism of FD or SE in this way. At the end of this article, a case study based on a practical circuit model is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",2-s2.0-85089296525

"Introducing a New Method for DPMU in Detecting the Type and Location of the Fault Introduction: Nowadays, due to the increasing development of distribution networks, their safety and high-reliability performance are of particular importance. One of the most important prob-lems that endanger the security and reliability of these networks is the creation of some faults in them. In case of a fault in the network, identifying its location and type can be of great help in repairing faulty equipment. Also, by detecting the disconnection of one of the equipment or lines, it is possible to pre-vent accidents in the network. Methods: Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) has been widely and successfully used as Transmission-Phasor Measurement Unit (T-PMU). The reporting time of PMUs is much shorter than the old Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. They can provide synchronized phasor measurements that can generate voltage phasors of different network nodes. This study aimed to investigate the various applications of phasor measurement units in distribution networks and present a new method for detecting and analyzing the location and type of fault and topology fault of the distribution network using the Internet of Things (IOT) analysis method. Results: To implement this method, it is necessary to measure different parameters of the distribution network before and after the occurrence of a fault, which is used by the DPMU for measurement. The simulation results indicate that for both single-topology and multi-topology faults, the proposed method has higher accuracy and better detection than the remaining common methods and effectively detects single-topology and multi-topology faults in the distribution network. Conclusion: This method can provide a more accurate network topology to estimate the state of the distribution network, which improves the accuracy of the state estimation and is suitable for implement-ing various advanced functions of the distribution management system. © 2023 Bentham Science Publishers.",2-s2.0-85179361263
"Antennas Applications and Field Measurement in Power System Distribution Networks for Electric Arcs Induced Electromagnetic Signals Waves Remote Sensing This paper presents both, the theoretical and experimental studies of the radio antennas’ applications and field measurement feasibility and capability for the detection and location of the electric arcs Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum bands measurement. Generally, these RF-signals are referred to as electromagnetic (EM) signal frequency energy radiated intensity contents (sferic). Which can be used to monitor the power arcing faults sferic to pinpoint these arcs hazard’s locations within the power distribution networks. Bearing in mind that such fault source triangulation technique is commonly referred to as a radio measurement method. The effects of this novel system implementation function and operation are best demonstrated by the Geographical Positioning System (GPS) aspect. However, for this novel system implementation which could meet the power system fault protection scheme requirements, the design of the wireless sensors devices structures is of critical importance. In other words, the antenna apparatus together with its mode of operation and function need to be further scrutinized and clarified. Because onsite under a real field measurement condition the air-bone signals sensors such as the antenna can detect any kind of RF-signal generated by various EM sferic waves transmitters. For that reason, to preserve the integrity, reliability and feasibility of this novel proposed method, the aforesaid antenna apparatus mode of operation must be clearly specified. This way the discrimination of the power arcing EM sferic frequency spectrum band from those of other external sources could be simply achieved. Thus, preventing the failures of this novel proposed method. However, according to radio theory the antenna is associated generally with the region of transition between a guided wave and the free space waves. Hence, the antenna can be regarded as either an EM sferic wave transmitter and / or receiver. That is to say, the antenna is a device that uses an oscillating distribution to produce electromagnetic radiation. In other words, an antenna is simply an oscillating electric dipole into which a pair of electric charges appear to be varying sinusoidal manner with time such that at any instant the two charges have equal magnitude but opposite sign. Under this concept of the antenna, herein this research project a RF-signal receiver antenna device is scrutinized in detail to evaluate its ability, capability and feasibility for the monitoring of the single phase-to-ground faults associated to various types of sparks discharges also known as the power arcing faults. Through this investigation several antenna types were explored and scrutinized in detail. These include the following: (i) The loop antenna, (ii) The dish or parabolic antenna and (iii) The Yagi-Uda antenna. The particularity of these antennas kinds is that these devices consist of the commonly used onsite for the lightning events monitoring together with various man-made RF-signals measurements. However, since the power distribution system networks landscapes are quite huge and unfriendly, therefore, to minimize these landscape challenges in terms of monitoring complexities, the major radio measurement requirements (in terms of antennas’ parameters) which underline the performance of this specific wireless sensor apparatus field measurement are examined. In addition, the design of the adequate signal filtering devices which could cope with the electric arcs induced RF-signals onsite under the real field measurement environment and conditions are scrutinized as well. © 2024 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.-All rights reserved.",2-s2.0-105000888698
"An Hi/H ∞ optimisation approach to distributed event-triggered fault detection over wireless sensor networks This paper is concerned with the problem of distributed event-triggered fault detection (FD) for linear discrete time-varying systems over resource-constrained wireless sensor networks. To reduce unnecessary communication frequency of sensor measurements and thus communication resource expenditure, an event-triggered communication mechanism is employed to determine whether or not each sensor's measurement should be broadcast to the distributed fault detection filter (FDF) over the wireless network at each time step. Then, an (Formula presented.) optimisation approach is proposed to achieve distributed event-triggered fault detection for the concerned system. Specifically, a set of distributed event-triggered FDFs is constructed based on the event-triggered measurement information from each sensor node and its adjacent nodes. Different from the existing distributed event-triggered FD schemes, the major contributions of this paper are twofold. First, the proposed FDF for each sensor node can be designed individually and the residual signal on each node is completely decoupled from the event-triggered transmission error. Second, the design of distributed event-triggered FDFs is formulated as an (Formula presented.) optimisation problem and an optimal solution can be obtained by recursively computing some Riccati recursions. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2-s2.0-85104456339

"Step-coated FBG and runway-shaped beam 6-D F/T sensor with dynamic self-fault-tolerant for orthopedic surgery robot This paper proposed a step-coated Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) 6-axis Force/Torque (F/T) sensor with self-fault tolerance for robot-assisted surgery interaction state monitoring. Step-coated FBG achieves a twin reflection spectrum of double-wavelength peaks and hardware redundancy for a single branch, leading to temperature self-compensation without additional FBG and supporting enough data for fault tolerance. Eight step-coated FBGs have been cross-tensioned and welded into the runway-shaped beam from the designed sensor to raise long-term and high temperature (200°C) stability. The regulating mechanism of the step-coated FBG’s temperature and strain sensitivity by coating size was established, providing a modified theory of FBG sensing. The designed sensor’s performance characterization and optimization model has been derived considering the parameters of coating and runway-shaped beam, leading to a low max full-scale error (MFSE, 3.46%) and inter-dimensional coupling error (8.96%). The step-coated FBG and least squares matrix libraries are united to form a hardware and algorithm collaborative fault-tolerant strategy with temperature self-compensation, achieving a real-time (0.2 ms) recovery rate of 25.7%. Experiment results demonstrate that the temperature self-compensation and long-time stability measure errors are less than 4.39% and 5.93%, respectively. A robot-assisted surgery system equipped with the designed sensor and Multi-channel Convolutional Gated Recurrent Unit-based (MCGRU) identification model has been constructed to monitor the force and stages during orthopedic procedures. The MCGRU realized a stage identification accuracy of 97.7%, only relying on wavelength data. The breakthrough detection and force control experiments have been implemented in bovine bone, animal skull, and corpse skull to further verify the design sensor feasibility and effectiveness for robot-assisted orthopedic surgery. © The Author(s) 2025.",2-s2.0-105003999287

"Robust Fault Detection for Fuzzy-Model-Based Networked Control Systems Under Denial-of-Service Attacks and Sensor Faults Within a Stochastic Communication Protocol This paper investigates the robust fault detection problem in non-linear networked systems, characterized by the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model. The analysis is complicated by Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks and sensor faults. In such systems, DoS attacks disrupt network communications, threatening both system stability and fault detection accuracy. Simultaneously, sensor faults compromise the reliability of the system's measurement outputs. To address these challenges, the stochastic communication protocol (SCP) is employed to optimize the transmission order between multiple sensors and the fault detector, effectively managing the limitations of communication capacity. Consequently, a fault detection scheme based on SCP is developed to generate residual signals, supported by an auxiliary residual system for stability analysis. Using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii (L-K) functional approach, sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the asymptotic stability of the residual system with a prescribed (Formula presented.) performance. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed fault detection scheme is validated through simulation examples. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2-s2.0-105002378094
"Replayable Augmented Reality Visualization for Robot Fault Diagnosis: A Comparative Study Efficient fault diagnosis in autonomous robotic systems is essential for minimizing downtime. This study compares the effectiveness of an Augmented Reality (AR) interface and sensor data replay (featuring a 15-second loop before the fault) in diagnosing common robot faults. In a user study, 24 participants experienced a series of eight staged robot fault scenarios. A tablet-based interface, presenting identical information, was favoured over AR due to its effectiveness and ease of use. Participant feedback highlighted the limitations of the AR interface including the low field of view and blurriness, suggesting potential improvements in future AR headset iterations.

"Active fault tolerant control based on adaptive interval observer for uncertain systems with sensor faults In this article, we present an active fault tolerant control scheme based on fault detection and isolation (FDI) for a class of uncertain systems subject to sensor faults. The FDI unit consists of a fault detection (FD) module and a fault isolation (FI) module, to determine when and where the sensor fault happens. It is noted that the FD module is based on a proposed adaptive interval observer where adaptive parameters instead of conservative uncertainty bounds are used, as a result, the sensitivity to faults is improved. When the FD module detects a fault, a compensation controller (CC) and an FI module are activated. The CC is designed to maintain some level of performance assuming all sensors are faulty. After the FI module determines the location of the fault, a reconfigured controller is activated to give improved performance with reduced conservatism. Importantly, the unmeasurable states and faulty output are approximated as a linear combination of their upper and lower bounds, and linear parameter are determined by adaptive laws. Finally, a simulation example is utilized to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2-s2.0-85100024062
"Train axle temperature detection and communication design based on wireless sensor The failure rate of the device will also increase under high temperature conditions, which will bring more severe challenges to the reliability of the chip. In this paper, the research will be carried out from the characteristics of the chip's elevated temperature and the characteristics of the application, and then an online temperature monitoring system is set up in the subway car in combination with communication technology and sensor network technology. In this paper, the main part of the node detection of temperature and the receiving and sending of files are studied. The temperature of the axle needs to be measured, and then the temperature data is sent to the main part. The node should have the characteristics of easy installation and the main power supply method is battery power. The energy consumption of the collection process should be as low as possible. If temperature collection is not required, the node can maintain low power operation and resume when needed. The structure detection mainly includes the detection module that only receives, and the temperature value module processed by the single-chip microcomputer. The traditional shaft temperature detection efficiency is low, and it is often detected after the fault occurs, which greatly reduces the safety. Therefore, the new shaft temperature detection mode should be combined with the communication technology to enhance the ability of information transmission. New electronic instruments can combine the modular software and hardware into one to test the program. The traditional measurement method is modularized, and finally, a program can be used to complete the specific link of each module, and all the functions can be gathered together to facilitate the realization of the role of the measuring instrument.

"Challenges Evaluation During Power Arcing Faults Radio Measurements According to the statistics derived from the power system protection field most of the system hazards are of single phase-to-ground fault types. Which are quite often associated with intermittent sparks discharges. Since these kinds of hazards are quite difficult to detect in the system, this paper proposes a novel approach which divorces completely with the conventional practices. In other words, this paper presents an alternative approach for the monitoring of the single phase-to-ground faults associated with the power arcing hazards with the aid of radio measurement only. Bearing in mind that although this novel proposed method tries to divorce the conventional faults’ mitigation techniques, it intends to provide a backup solution which could supplement these above-mentioned traditional fault protection schemes. However, referring to the discovery of Marconi, in addition to several physics’ theories namely Faraday’s laws and Maxwell’s differential equations, it is evident nowadays to relate the electric arcing (or sparks discharges) intermittent current path and the electromagnetic energy fields. Based on this evidence this paper introduced a novel method which relies exclusively on the arc fault sparks discharges induced Electromagnetic Radiated energy (EMR) to decide both the detection and the location of these electric arcs. Since under a real field measurement condition, the air-bone signals sensors such as the antennas can detect any kind of Radio Frequency (RF) signals, therefore the main objective of this study consists of evaluating the possible challenges which might emerge during radio measurement. These potential challenges concern the reliability and capability of the antenna’s operation and function. In other words, the fundamental objective consists of providing evidence that during the electric arc radio measurement process these wireless sensors are capturing the arc induced EMR signals waves instead of those radiated by other external sources including the energized power lines for instance. To provide evidence of the antenna potential in clarifying the detection of the power arcing faults EMR from those generated by the external sources, this paper has undergone sophisticate and significant experimental measurements. As a result, it follows that despite the existence of the external noises interference, still the radio measurement of the electric arcs is not only a distinctive, but it is also a promising tool which needs to be further scrutinized to be incorporated in the power system protection field. © 2024 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.-All rights reserved.",2-s2.0-85213511162
"Sensor fault diagnosis in nonlinear stochastic systems: a hybrid system formulation This paper introduces a novel Fault Diagnosis (FD) approach for nonlinear stochastic dynamic systems susceptible to multiple, potentially concurrent sensor faults. We formulate the FD problem as a hybrid state estimation problem. To achieve this, a vector of binary state variables is introduced to augment the continuous-valued state variables. These binary variables act as an on-off switching mechanism, providing a framework for independent reasoning about the presence or absence of each sensor fault. Leveraging this hybrid dynamic system formulation, encompassing both binary and continuous-valued states within a single Particle Filter (PF) framework, enables our approach to efficiently co-estimate fault modes alongside dynamic system states. This innovation ensures efficient diagnosis of multiple, potentially concurrent sensor faults while circumventing the need for the cumbersome bank of estimators characteristic of traditional Multiple Model (MM) approaches used for FD. The performance of the proposed algorithm in diagnosing multiple sensor faults is evaluated using a benchmark nonlinear system from the literature. The results demonstrably validate the algorithm's efficacy, solidifying its potential for practical sensor FD applications under conditions of single or multiple faults. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2-s2.0-85210587966
"Enhanced Method for Localization of Partial Discharges in Oil-Filled Transformers Using Acoustic Emission Signals Accurate measurement of partial discharges (PD) in power transformers is crucial for fault identification and effective maintenance planning. Acoustic emission (AE) sensing, less susceptible to external electromagnetic interference, offers non-invasive PD detection. This paper investigates the relationship between AE detection intensity, PD source type, and distance using AE sensors. Corona discharges exhibited the strongest AE wave intensities, followed by creepage discharges and PD in bubbles. AE wave intensity varies significantly based on discharge propagation speed, medium, and discharge space volume. The study experimentally compared three Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) calculation methods for localization: energy criterion, Generalized Cross-Correlation (GCC), and GCC with Phase Transformation (PHAT). The energy criterion excelled in distributed sensor setups, while GCC-PHAT was superior in centralized configurations. GCC-PHAT, effectively suppressing noise and reflections, consistently outperformed standard GCC in accuracy, even at low discharge intensities. These findings promise improved precision and effectiveness in power transformer maintenance diagnostics. © 2024, Prognostics and Health Management Society. All rights reserved.",2-s2.0-85207383030

"Liner Wear Prediction Using Bayesian Regression Models and Clustering Chutes, bins, and hoppers are critical assets in bulk commodity handling. Sacrificial wear liners are employed to protect these assets from abrasive wear. An essential maintenance challenge is optimising the timing of liner replacements. Traditionally, episodic human inspections have been in place, but now, real-time wireless IoT sensing systems that measure liner thickness are being used. We propose a novel approach to estimate the remaining useful chute liner life. Instead of linear extrapolation based on individual sensor wear rates (commonly used in industry), we leverage a Clustered Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling (BHM). Two models are developed: Model 1 (Cluster Exemplar) uses parameters from the closest cluster exemplar, while Model 2 (Spatial and Temporal BHM) incorporates data from the active sensor, with prior distribution informed by Model 1. Data are drawn from a single hopper with 88 sensors, 20 of which reached their end-of-life threshold. Both Model 1 and Model 2 outperform the industry regression approach, significantly reducing overprediction. Notably, Model 2 predicts remaining useful life within 95% credible intervals and identifies anomalous sensor performance.

"Observer-based fault diagnosis for autonomous systems With the advancement in sensor and communication technology, autonomous systems have been incrementally reshaping the execution of tasks in commercial and military sectors. Since the systems are designed to complete tasks without or with minimal human intervention, fault diagnosis based on sensor data has been crucial to preventing accidents and fatalities. In this paper, fault diagnosis for autonomous systems is designed based on nonlinear adaptive observers, tested in numerical simulations, and implemented in a robotic platform. To this end, we utilize the persistence of excitation conditions on the parametric model of the faults. We derive sufficient conditions for the nonlinear adaptive observer in terms of linear matrix inequality to ensure the convergence of the estimates. Furthermore, we consider one-sided Lipschitz conditions to obtain less conservative results. The main advantage of using the nonlinear adaptive observer is that the method converges quickly to the actual fault and requires minimum computational effort. However, solving the linear matrix inequality might not be trivial.

Nevertheless, the model accuracy could be degraded by sensor measurement error, which may arise due to environmental interferences or inadequate maintenance practices. In the study, the impacts of sensor measurement error on the convolutional neuron network (CNN) based FDD model for the data center composite cooling system are assessed. Additionally, the coupled effects of sensor error and system control strategies on the FDD model are investigated. The results indicate that in vapor compression mode, a negative fixed sensor error of 1 K leads to an average 5 % greater decline in the CNN model accuracy compared to a positive error of the same magnitude. In contrast, the positive fixed error causes a 6.5 % higher decrease in heat pipe mode. Additionally, sensor errors have a negligible impact on model accuracy until exceeding the threshold, and the threshold of fixed error is 0.2 K in CNN model. Further, as a key control strategy involved parameters, the evaporating temperature error is critical to FDD model accuracy.

"Sensor fault estimation based on the constrained zonotopic Kalman filter For solving the additive and multiplicative sensor faults in the constrained system with unknown but bounded noise, the constrained zonotopic Kalman filter-based additive sensor fault estimator and multiplicative sensor fault estimator are designed, respectively. In the fault estimation process, the states of the system are contained in the zonotopic sets estimated by the constrained zonotopic Kalman filter. The fault detection is carried out by judging whether the true value of the system's output is within the upper and lower bounds of its estimated zonotopic set. Once a fault is detected in the system, the corresponding sensor fault estimator can be used to estimate the additive or multiplicative sensor faults, and the corresponding zonotopic set and interval set can be obtained, respectively. Finally, comparative analyses of the proposed constrained zonotopic Kalman filter-based fault estimators and the zonotopic Kalman filter-based fault estimators in both numerical and case simulations prove the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and show the advantages of this algorithm in view of conservativeness. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2-s2.0-85107054291
"A method of fault tolerance and mitigation in wireless sensor networks For a system fault tolerance is the ability to do the work without any interference. In present era wireless sensor network has wide role or a variety of applications with unlimited future scopes. In Wireless Sensor Networks there are several types of failures just because of various environmental hazards, such as interference, internal factures(battery failure, hardware failure, link errors, DoS attack, processor failure, transceiver failure etc., which affects the whole transmission and therefore the deployment of Wireless Sensor Network is not effective. In this manner fault tolerance is most critical issue in Wireless Sensor Networks. This paper presents, how the faulty nodes of mobile communication can be detect and mitigate. It is very tough to monitor the WSNs continuously by manual operator, so there is a requirement of a system which is in capable of overcoming the failures and can send the data in proper manner. The WSN should be designed in such a way that it should be able to find out the faulty nodes, try to resolve and then transmit the sensed data if any fault occurs and make the fault free network by improving fault tolerance capability. In this paper we have proposed an algorithm for fault detection, which will rectify the fault and make the network fault free, ultimately maximizes the efficiency of the cluster and improves the network performance. © 2021 River Publishers.

"INTELLIGENT MAINTENANCE STRATEGIES FOR TRANSPORT SYSTEMS: A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH TO THERMOMECHANICAL STRESS REDUCTION Modern transport systems are increasingly challenged by significant thermomechanical loads encountered during operation. These include high temperatures, mechanical stress, vibrations, and dynamic forces, which lead to accelerated component wear, decreased reliability, and rising operational costs-necessitating a re-evaluation of conventional maintenance strategies. This paper emphasizes the potential of predictive maintenance (PdM) powered by artificial intelligence, which allows for early identification of component wear and damage before they reach critical levels. By leveraging machine learning, neural networks, big data analytics, and digital twins, PdM enables the optimization of operating conditions, reduction of thermomechanical stress, and real-time monitoring of transport system health through sensors, IoT devices, and cloud computing platforms. The study's findings demonstrate that AI-driven maintenance significantly reduces accident rates, prolongs equipment lifespan, lowers repair expenses, and enhances both economic and environmental performance. Promising future directions include deeper integration with digital twins, autonomous algorithm updates, and the application of quantum computing to further improve prediction accuracy. © 2025, International Organization on 'Technical and Physical Problems of Engineering'.

"Automatic machinery fault detection via using distributed sensor information It is critical in intelligent manufacturing that monitors devices to sustain normal status. Recently, the artificial intelligence-powered diagnosis is the key in smart monitoring process and has become a hot topic in the engineering field. In previous diagnostic methods, complete failure samples are the premise to activate the intelligent diagnostic model. However, the actual failures of the mechanical diagnostic are far more than that we can obtain under running state in advance. In order solve this issue, this paper adopts Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) by using simulated data to obtain complete failure samples, which builds a bridge between artificial intelligent model and mechanical fault diagnostic system. In mechanical diagnostic system, we first use finite element simulation to generate the missing fault samples. The generated and existing fault samples are supplemented each other to construct complete failure samples. The complete failure samples are used as training set to train an intelligent model which is used to predict the status for future status of mechanical system. The status of mechanical system is represented as the signal from distributed sensors.

"A Novel Sliding Online Intelligent Fault Diagnosing Observer with Maintenance Technique Based on Probability Distributions for Uncertain Systems – This paper introduces an intelligently optimised Additive Fault Observer, the Intelligent Fault Diagnosing Observer (IFDO). It is designed to manage plants affected by additive faults while accounting for sensor white noise. The paper also presents an innovative online performance evaluation algorithm. The IFDO plays an essential role in the fault diagnosis process by verifying Lyapunov conditions and incorporating rules for fault estimation. Additionally, it features an essential sequential sampling filter based on the likelihood ratio, which integrates both target and sampling distributions. In order to evaluate effectively the observer performance, a comparison has been conducted between the Kalman filter and the high-gain observer while accounting for sensor white noise and four distinct types of additive faults: constant, white, coloured, and non-Gaussian. In the presence of white sensor noise, the evaluation focuses on the discrepancy between the plant's output and the results from the two observers, along with the Kalman filter, rather than the state errors. In an innovative online performance assessment, the algorithm's parameters are informed by essential metrics like mean physical error, relative error, coefficient of determination, correlation, F1 score, curve fitting parameters, diagnosed fault size, and kernel density estimates for the residuals' mean and maximum values. The execution is systematically divided into a set number of batches, each one containing multiple samples. Through rigorous data analysis, the simulation illustrates that the Online Performance Evaluation (OPE) algorithm encompasses vital criteria for effectively monitoring plant health during each iteration.

"Milling tool wear prediction using an integrated wireless multi-sensor tool holder and convolutional neural networks In precision machining, it is necessary to predict tool wear and estimate the remaining useful life to produce high-quality products at a low cost. To meet this need, it is necessary to monitor the machining process by developing a multi-sensor dynamometer for data acquisition and a system for signal processing and tool wear estimation. The cutting force and vibration of the tool are two important parameters in tool condition monitoring. In this work, a new multi-sensor tool holder is designed, fabricated, and tested to simultaneously and wirelessly measure the torque, tri-axial vibration, and angular position of the tool. It has high rigidity, the ability to change the sensitivity, and the least interference for different working environments and provides data instantly in real-time. All sensors and data transmission systems are placed in the tool holder. In the present work, a new approach in the application of Convolutional Neural Networks is used for tool wear prediction. First, the Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) parameters are optimized by the Sparrow Search Algorithm. VMD is a new technique for decomposing signals into intrinsic mode functions. Tool signals are then converted into images by using the Hilbert–Huang spectrum through optimized VMD. The sharp and worn cuttings tool shows different characteristics in the images. Finally, Dense Net is used for image classification and tool wear prediction. The results of the experiments showed that the designed system can quickly transmit sensor data and detect tool wear in a very short time with 93% prediction accuracy, which shows a suitable performance of the system. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature 2024.",2-s2.0-85202657014
"IoT based maintenance for mine hydraulic excavators Maintenance problems in mining equipment are considered as ill-structured problems for which effective algorithmic results are not possible due to lack of unknown nature of failures and mine conditions.

Majority of the maintenance optimization models are, in general, considers a fixed value of the cost of breakdown maintenance. But, the cost of breakdown maintenance not only includes down time losses and repair/replacement cost, but may also include various indirect cost. Prior detection of faults represents the most effective way to reduce the breakdown but the existing Indian scenario in terms of machine maintenance reveals the predominance of breakdown maintenance culture in the coal mining industries in particular and industries involving heavy duty earth moving machinery in general.

"Fault Tolerance analysis of an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System for mandatory lane changing decisions in automated driving Past research has developed a binary decision model for mandatory lane changes based on the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). This ANFIS Decision Model (simply called ADEM), developed and tested with the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) data, mimics the sensory inputs and decisions of human drivers. This research assumed that ADEM will be implemented as part of the automated lane changing system in Automated Vehicles (AVs). The system in AVs will depend on active radar sensors to make measurements. The sensor outputs will be converted into the input parameter values of ADEM. This research tested ADEM's performance when the sensors could only measure the distance of surrounding vehicles within 50m, and when one of the sensors malfunctions. The original NGSIM test data set was modified to simulate the sensors’ detection range limit in Scenario 0, plus six other scenarios in which each sensor took turns to fail and assumed either the minimum or maximum possible output values. The results show that: (i) ADEM performs in a safer manner when considering the sensors’ limited detection range; (ii) the minimum value of 0m should be used as the default sensor output when a sensor fails, so that ADEM makes safer mandatory lane changing decisions; and (iii) the most critical sensors, by which failure of any of them would cause the greatest degradation to ADEM's performance, are the two sensors that measure the distances to the preceding and the following vehicles in the target lane. © 2022 Tongji University and Tongji University Press",2-s2.0-85134304665
"Fault analysis of three phase using auto reset for temporary fault and trip for permanent fault The motive of this paper is to create a routine tripping mechanism. For a three phase system, the output of our project resets for the temporary fault, while, in case of permanent fault, it trips the system. These shortcomings are detected by our gadget and it naturally separates the inventory to keep away from blast/fire harm which may influence the control equips in the sub-stations. The stumbling framework is made by utilizing 3, 1-stage transformers which have both info and yield in star association, and 3 transformers in delta associations with contribution of 220 volt and yield of 12 volt. Here low voltage testing is shown. For both transient and long span flaws 555 clocks are utilized. To activate tripping mechanism, switches are used which creates the three types of fault in low voltage side.

"An inverse fault detection and diagnosis (IFDD) strategy for practical application on chiller product; [Une stratégie de détection et de diagnostic inverse des défaillances (IFDD) pour une application pratique sur les refroidisseurs] Current research on chiller fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) is usually based on the multi-classification method for mixed multiple fault types. The establishment of a multi-classification FDD model requires obtaining extensive test data of normal operation and multiple common faults at different fault levels, so the cost-to-benefit ratio will not be accepted. In addition, because of the information interference between different types of fault data, FDD model is hard to avoid over-fitting or under-fitting, and there may be an intolerable high false alarm rate existing in product application. Therefore, it is difficult to promote FDD in actual chiller product applications. This paper proposes an inverse fault detection and diagnosis (IFDD) strategy, which is based on the characteristics of the target fault (the fault to be concerned) to establish a two-classification fault diagnosis model. Compared with the multi-classification method, the amount of fault test data required by the two-classification methods to realize fault diagnosis can be greatly reduced. With IFDD strategy, the detection and diagnosis are completed simultaneously, while fast calculation speed, high diagnosis accuracy rate and low false alarm rate are achieved. The core of the IFDD strategy is to concentrate resources to capture the characteristics of the target fault, and no longer classify other types of faults and normal operating conditions, so it can avoid the influence of information interference between multiple types of fault data in the fault diagnosis model. In order to verify the feasibility of this strategy, a 200 ton variable-speed screw chiller has been tested on the laboratory, and a database of normal operation, refrigerant leakage, refrigerant overcharge faults, and a new operating condition of insufficient cooling water flow is initially established. Based on the sensors configured by the chiller unit and using the exponentially weighted moving-average (EWMA) control chart for IFDD, the model's fault diagnosis accuracy for the target fault reaches 100%, and no false alarm appears after the transition period. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd and IIR",2-s2.0-85126115106

"The impact of improved PCA method based on anomaly detection on chiller sensor fault detection; [L'impact de la méthode PCA améliorée basée sur la détection d'anomalies sur la détection des défaillances des capteurs du refroidisseur] With the widespread use of building automation systems (BAS), a large amount of chiller operating data is often readily available, which provides a good basis for optimizing the control of unit sensors. However, these data are highly coupled and contain a large number of outliers which would significantly affect sensor fault detection. Compared with the traditional PCA method, the improved kernel PCA can effectively handle nonlinear data. Meanwhile, anomaly detection has shown excellent ability in rejecting outliers, so an anomaly detection step before fault detection is also necessary. Therefore, to address the problem of data presence coupling and outliers, this study attempts to investigate the impact of different anomaly detection methods on PCA and KPCA based chiller sensor fault detection. Based on the optimal combination of features screened by importance and correlation analysis to construct a fault detection model, the impact of two anomaly detection methods (Isolation Forest and K-means) on KPCA fault detection was analyzed and compared. To obtain general results, an experimental dataset of RP-1043 is used to validate the study. The results show that both anomaly detection methods can improve the overall quality of the original training data. Compared with the traditional PCA method, KPCA improves the detection efficiency by 1.7%–28.29% at all fault magnitudes. The IF-KPCA and Kmeans-KPCA improve the fault detection efficiency by 3.66%–14.63% and 3.17%-20% on top of KPCA.

"Machine learning tool for the prediction of electrode wear effect on the quality of resistance spot welds The quality of resistance spot welding (RSW) joints is strongly affected by the condition of the electrodes. This work develops a machine learning-based tool to automatically assess the influence of electrode wear on the quality of RSW welds. Two different experimental campaigns were performed to evaluate the effect of electrode wear on the mechanical strength of spot welds. The resulting failure load of the joints has been used to define the weld quality classes of the machine learning tool, while data from electrode displacement and electrode force sensors, embedded in the welding machine, have been processed to identify the predictors of the tool. Some machine learning algorithms have been tested. The most performing algorithm, i.e., the neural network, achieved an accuracy of 90%. This work provides important theoretical and practical contributions. First, the decreasing thermal expansion of the weld nugget as the electrode degradation advances results in a strong correlation between the difference of the maximum displacement value and the last value recorded during the welding and the relative failure load. Then, this work offers a practical decision support tool for manufacturers. In fact, the automatic detection of low-quality welds allows to reduce or eliminate unnecessary redundant welds, which are performed to compensate for the uncertainty of electrode wear. This leads to savings in time, energy, and resources for manufacturers. Finally, general recommendations for the timing of redressing or replacing the electrode are provided in the manuscript based on the company willingness to accept some non-compliant welds or not. © The Author(s) 2024.",2-s2.0-85184925141

By leveraging machine learning algorithms to predict when equipment failure will likely occur, maintenance teams can proactively schedule maintenance activities and prevent unexpected breakdowns. Fault detection and diagnosis are essential components of PdM. Fault detection involves analyzing sensor data collected from equipment to identify deviations from normal behavior. Diagnosis, however, involves identifying the root cause of a fault or failure. A dataset of an industrial asset is used to evaluate the proposed study. K-means clustering anomaly detection approach is employed. Implementing machine learning (ML)-based fault categorization approaches revealed that Random Forest had the best results. Significant progress has been made in fault detection and diagnosis using ML, but the degree of their explainability is significantly limited by the ""black-box""character of some ML techniques.

"Design of a fault detection and recovery method for cluster based underwater wireless sensor networks In the past few years Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSN) has achieved a tremendous area of interest in research. Large number of sensor nodes operates independently in harsh underwater environment. Failures and faults are inevitable in UWSN because of high water pressure, high node mobility ratio, low bandwidth etc. The network operation and data communication will cause the sensor nodes to dissipate their energy at a faster rate. As replacing the underwater sensor nodes is a challenging task, it’s not easy to recharge the batteries of the nodes when energy is dissipated. Failure of nodes may cause data loss and connectivity loss. Therefore it is necessary to identify such faults and failures within the network and propose some mechanism to overcome such problems. In this research work we propose a Cluster Based Fault Detection and Recovery method to identify the occurrence of fault within the CH. We observe that this method proves it is fast and efficient solution for robust and scalable UWSN. The proposed algorithm is compared with other methodologies like RCH and SDMCGC. The simulation results show that in proposed methodology delay is reduced by 10% to 15%, Packet Delivery Ratio is increased by 5% and 15%, and Packet Drop Ratio is reduced by 10% to 24%.

To ensure the security of the system, a bank of residual-based detectors is designed to detect sensor faults in the form of deviation, and a consistency-checking scheme is proposed by using the redundancy of the multi-sensor structure, where multiple anomaly detectors are developed to monitor inconsistencies between observations from the BDS and each auxiliary sensor, thereby exposing the stealthy attack against the BDS. Compared with the existing watermarking technology-based detection methods, the proposed method avoids the risk of key information being cracked, providing more security. By using the detection results, a covariance intersection algorithm-based isolation scheme is proposed to eliminate the impact of faults and attacks on system performance. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are demonstrated on a semi-physical simulation platform. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2-s2.0-105010522115
"Fault detection in networked control systems under DoS attacks via the round-robin scheduling protocol This paper explores fault detection (FD) in networked control systems (NCSs) exposed to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, with a particular emphasis on the round-robin (RR) scheduling protocol. The RR scheduling protocol is employed to alleviate data congestion and optimise energy consumption, thereby transforming the discrete system into a protocol-induced periodic system. A challenge addressed in this paper is the disruption of communication between sensors and the zero-order holder (ZOH) caused by DoS attacks, which obstruct the flow of critical data. To address these issues, we first construct an associated residual system. Using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii (L-K) functional method, we derive sufficient conditions that ensure both asymptotic stability and specified (Formula presented.) performance of the residual system. Based on these conditions, we design an FD filter and determine its optimal parameters. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed FD filter is validated through numerical simulations. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2-s2.0-105008666430
"Interval observer design for unobservable switched nonlinear partial differential equation systems and its application This paper designs an interval observer for switched nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) systems. Initially, persistent dwell-time switching rules are used to model switched PDE systems with fast and slow switching phenomena. Next, for unobservable systems caused by uncertainties, the interval observer for the target PDE systems is proposed by utilizing unknown but bounded information of the initial states, boundary conditions, external disturbances, and measurement noises. Subsequently, by utilizing the estimated state's upper and lower bounds, an interval observer-based control strategy is devised to stabilize the studied systems, and sufficient conditions to ensure the stability of the target systems and the observation error dynamics are provided. Furthermore, the designed interval observer is employed to detect sensor failures in the presence of various uncertainties. Finally, two examples, including the lithium-ion battery's temperature estimation and fault detection, are utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained methods. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2-s2.0-85199342693
"Experimental evaluation of power saving mode against powering down in an NB-IoT modem Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is standardized by 3GPP to support low power devices that are deployed in locations that mandate requirements such as deep coverage and long battery life. This technology is adopted in applications such as smart water and gas metering, agriculture and many that require infrequent access to NB-IoT network. In such applications, the devices are in deep sleep more than 95% of the time. In deep sleep, the modems are expected to consume near zero currents. In order to support such applications 3GPP introduced power saving mode (PSM). During this deep sleep devices are not reachable for any downlink communication. Some NB-IoT modems such as one from Quectel provide an option to power down the modem, henceforth called as power down mode (PDM). This option looks more attractive as the modem consumes less current compared to PSM. This paper experimentally evaluates PDM and PSM using a Quectel modem. It is observed that even though current consumption in PDM is less than PSM for more than 95% of the time, still PSM is better than PDM when looked at holistically, i.e. cumulative of active, idle and sleep current consumption. Additionally, PDM generates additional signalling compared to PSM. © 2021 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85142364174
"Aircraft Flight Movement Anomaly Detection using Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) is an aircraft backup radar device that transmits aircraft sensor information via radio frequency. This data can be used to detect aircraft changes that occur significantly or abnormally (anomaly). Anomaly detection in this study aims to reduce and prevent flight accidents by analyzing abnormal data on aircraft flights using the Deep Learning (DL) model. Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) and Bidirectional GRU (Bi-GRU) models are proposed as DL models which are implemented on ADS-B data using data mining methods. The data is generated from the ADS-B device that records the plane crash incident and is stored on the Flightradar24 community server. Data containing sensor changes from anomalous aircraft movements are studied for predictability on other flight data. The class breakdown is divided into two, anomaly and normal, based on information on the time span of anomaly occurrences in the accident investigation report of each aircraft using the sliding window technique in the data mining methodology. In evaluation, the confusion matrix measurement method is used to predict predictive analysis of the tested data. The results of the model evaluation performance show that the Bi-LSTM proposed in this study has the best accuracy of 99.44% and the f1-score of 99.51% is slightly superior to the Bi-GRU model. The model in this study can be applied in the ADS-B device to detect aircraft movement anomalies and as material for reviewing technicians in periodic maintenance and measuring the accuracy of the ADS-B device used as a backup radar. © International Journal on Informatics Visualization is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International License.",2-s2.0-85145923406
"Ensemble-based extreme learning machine model for occupancy detection with ambient attributes Context-aware computing is a growing research domain in present circumstances due to technological advancements in the area of sensors technology, big data, artificial intelligence and robotics and automation. It has many applications for making the daily life of human beings sustainable, comfortable, and smooth. Context ware computing also includes ambient intelligence and applications such as occupancy detection, prediction, user recognition etc. Occupancy detection and recognition help in developing intelligent applications which help the energy management, intelligent decision making, that results in cost reduction and fault and failure prevention of services and products in advance.

"Arcs Faults Induced Electromagnetic Signals Remote Sensing Study in Frequency Domain Since Marconi’s radio experiments in addition to several relevant measurement published results through scientific literatures, it is nowadays undeniable evidence that the electric arcs are indeed sources of Electromagnetic (EM) signal frequency energy radiated intensity contents (sferic). Based on this evidence this paper presents the arcs EM sferic sources points triangulation algorithm solution in frequency domain instead of time domain. As these EM sferic sources points triangulation technique is generally referred to as the Radio Measurement (RM) method. Which contrasts with the conventional electric fault monitoring schemes and practices. Thus, these traditional schemes and practices rely on exclusively the arc electric quantities, namely the arc-current and-voltage to decide the existence of the system abnormalities. However, since the power distribution networks landscape is quite huge and unfriendly, therefore the knowledge of the sferic spectrum bands is of critical importance. Because this knowledge of these sferic spectrum bands could help to design efficient wireless sensors devices for the purpose of providing efficient sferic novel monitoring system development. This novel system could be beneficial for both the power utilities and the customers from suffering considerably from these sferic impacts in terms of power outages and economics losses. However, the advantage and benefit of this novel method reside in the fact that it performs a pre-fault conditioning in terms of both the detection and location functions during the sferic earlier stage of formation. Especially when these arcs faults are not detectable by the conventional fault protective switchgears. Thus, reducing the power losses in terms of power outages together with the related economics issues as aforesaid. Moreover, through this novel method, the arc fault exact location can be provided regardless of any Euclidean plane been considered. Thus, reduces also considerably the fault hunting-and restoration-times. In the scientific contribution point of view this paper performs and evaluates several laboratory measurements and experiments which give a satisfactory background for further development of this novel proposed RM method. As this can be tested afterwards on real data. Bearing in mind that another contribution of this paper is that it provides a clear picture of the arc induced sferic spectrum bands which could help to discriminate the arc induced EM sferic from the existing external noises interference. These existing external noises transmitters include the man-made radio-, television-, mobile-, telephone-and several other kinds of broadcasts in addition to the natural phenomena including the lightning-, the solar flares-and corona-noises together with those generated by the neutron stars and black holes to some extent. In fact, most of the studies conducted by most of these aforesaid published scientific literatures were done in a time domain exclusively, especially in this RM field. Hence the limited number of relevant literatures concerning the detail and better understanding of these arcs’ hazards phenomenon. Therefore, unlike these literatures, this paper scrutinizes further these arcs hazards phenomenon nature, characteristics, behavior and properties in a frequency domain exclusively. As a result, it appears that this novel proposed arc faults monitoring system has shown its potential in clarifying the arc fault induced EM sferic detection and location algorithm solutions in frequency domain this time. © 2024 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.-All rights reserved.",2-s2.0-85213496345
"Improved fault tolerant SPRT detection method for node replication attacks in wireless sensor networks As the internet of things (IoT) emerges, the application and usage of the wireless sensor network (WSN) have been increasing quickly. Meanwhile, there are many threats and risks of information security that need to be effectively dealt with. One of these network attacks is the node replication attack. The attackers may catch sensor nodes, clone them, release them into the original network, and launch various internal attacks. Many replica detection instruments/methods are proposed for this type of attack. However, most detection are characterised as high computation and communication costs. Some detection methods based on the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) indicate much lower requirements of system overhead, but these prior works may sacrifice efficiency due to frequent retransmission of the message. In this paper, we propose a fault-tolerant method for replica detection based on the SPRT in WSNs. To improve the efficiency and reliability, we use the residual energy and slope of energy consumption of the node as appendices and then apply the SPRT to adjust the detection rate dynamically. The simulation results show that our proposed scheme achieves a better performance on the efficiency of detection and reduction of error rates.  © 2022 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",2-s2.0-85138099927
"Sliding mode based fault diagnosis with deep reinforcement learning add-ons for intrinsically redundant manipulators This article presents a fault diagnosis control scheme for intrinsically redundant robot manipulators based on the combination of a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach and a battery of sliding mode observers. The DRL plays the role of detecting and isolating possible sensor faults, thus generating an alarm and pin-pointing the source. This in turn allows to compensate the sensor faults independently from the actuator ones. The latter are therefore detected and isolated by a set of sliding mode observers driven by input laws designed according to an optimal reaching algorithm. In order to design and apply such observers, a global feedback linearization is performed, which transforms the multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear robot model into a chain of double integrators. The proposal is analyzed and assessed in realistic conditions using the PyBullet environment in which a 7 degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) Franka Emika Panda robot manipulator is reproduced. © 2023 The Authors.

"Fault detection and diagnosis in refrigeration systems using machine learning algorithms; [Détection et diagnostic des défaillances dans les systèmes frigorifiques à l'aide d'algorithmes d'apprentissage machine] The functionality of industrial refrigeration systems is important for environment-friendly companies and organizations, since faulty systems can impact human health by lowering food quality, cause pollution, and even lead to increased global warming. Therefore, in this industry, there is a high demand among manufacturers for early and automatic fault diagnosis. In this paper, different machine learning classifiers are tested to find the best solution for diagnosing twenty faults possibly encountered in such systems. All sensor faults and some relevant component faults are simulated in a high fidelity Matlab/Simscape model of the system, which has previously been used for controller development and verification. In this work, Convolutional Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Principal Components Analysis-SVM, Linear Discriminant Analysis-SVM, and Linear Discriminant Analysis classifiers are compared. The results indicate that the fault detection reliability of the algorithms highly depends on how well the training data covers the operation regime.

"An online compressor liquid floodback fault diagnosis method for variable refrigerant flow air conditioning system; [Méthode de diagnostic en ligne des défaillances de retour de liquide au compresseur dans un système de conditionnement d'air à débit de frigorigène variable] Compressor liquid floodback not only can drop the performance of the variable refrigerant flow (VRF) system, but also may cause mechanical failure. Therefore, this is necessary to perform a timely online diagnosis of that fault. The present paper proposes an online compressor liquid floodback fault diagnosis method for VRF system based on back-propagation neural network (BPNN), which fills the online compressor liquid floodback fault diagnosis knowledge gap. The proposed method main article context as follow: Firstly, the sensors in VRF system record and save the data every three seconds to form the raw dataset. Secondly, after preprocessing the raw dataset, the correlation analysis is used to filter the data variables. Thirdly, the BPNN model is established by using back-propagation neural network algorithm. The testing dataset was used to verify the reliability of the model. The online dataset was used to test the model's online diagnostic capability, and its results were also compared and analyzed to the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) model. This result indicates that the BPNN method has a low degree of over-fitting and high reliability, and its online diagnostic accuracy is up to 99.48%.

"Predicting remaining useful life of turbofan engines using degradation signal based echo state network The field of Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) in industries is gaining greater popularity to achieve high reliability by shifting the preventive maintenance to predictive maintenance. Estimation of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) is an effective prognostic measure that forecasts the health state of machine based on degradation modelling and condition monitoring.

"Bearing fault diagnosis using motor current signature analysis and the artificial neural network Bearings are critical components in rotating machinery. The need for easy and effective bearings fault diagnosis techniques has led to developing different monitoring approaches. In this research, however, a fault diagnosis system for bearings is developed based on the motor current signature analysis (MCSA) technique. Firstly, a test rig was built, and then different bearing faults were simulated and investigated in the test rig. Three current sensors, type SCT013, were interfaced to Arduino MEGA 2560 microcontroller and utilized together for data acquisition. The time-domain signals analysis technique was utilized to extract some characteristic features that are related to the simulated faults. It was noticed that the simulated bearing faults have led to generating vibrations in the induction motors, which in turn cause a change in its magnetic field. For classification (identification) of the extracted features, the artificial neural network (ANN) was employed. An ANN model was developed using the Matlab ANN toolbox to detect the simulated faults and give an indication about the machine health state. The obtained features from the captured motor current signals were utilized for training the ANN model. The results showed the effectiveness of using MCSA based on the timedomain signal analysis in combination with ANN in diagnosis different bearings faults. © 2020 Insight Society.",2-s2.0-85081209801
"Interval Observer Based Fault Detection for Lipschitz Nonlinear Systems Under Ellipsoidal Analysis This study devotes itself to the issue of fault detection for a class of discrete-time Lipschitz nonlinear systems by virtue of a set of restricted frequency-domain specifications. First of all, unlike traditional Luenberger-like observers, which only contain a unitary parameter matrix, a novel, more design–degree of freedom incorporated fault detection observer (FDO) under linear-matrix-inequality (LMI) conditions is innovatively constructed to access a more flexible practical adjustment range. And the evaluations of both fault sensitivity and disturbance robustness were quantified via finite-frequency (Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.) indices, respectively. Besides, the actuator and sensor faults were concurrently addressed in a more wide circumstance, where the reformulated Lipschitz property is utilized to handle what the complex nonlinear term causes. Furthermore, a novel, less computational dynamic threshold based on the ellipsoidal set-membership technique was creatively synthesized during timely fault detection so as to guarantee a smaller range of residual intervals.

"Sensor fault diagnosis in fractional-order singular systems using unknown input observer This paper investigates the design of an unknown input observer for sensor fault diagnosis in linear fractional-order singular systems. The considered system is rectangular in general form. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the proposed observer are derived, and a systematic design approach is presented. The designed observer is nonsingular and uses only the original coefficient matrices to reconstruct the sensor faults. The proposed diagnosis method can decouple both the unknown inputs appearing in the system dynamics and the output equation, using only the available inputs and measurable output signals. The asymptotic stability conditions of the designed observer are obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Moreover, the proposed approach is developed for sensor fault diagnosis in fractional-order singular one-sided Lipschitz systems. The convergence conditions of the designed nonlinear observer are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities by introducing a continuous frequency distributed equivalent model and using indirect Lyapunov approach.

"Integrity monitoring for Kalman filter-based localization The problem of quantifying robot localization safety in the presence of undetected sensor faults is critical when preparing for future applications where robots may interact with humans in life-critical situations; however, the topic is only sparsely addressed in the robotics literature. In response, this work leverages prior work in aviation integrity monitoring to tackle the more challenging case of evaluating localization safety in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied environments. Localization integrity risk is the probability that a robot’s pose estimate lies outside pre-defined acceptable limits while no alarm is triggered. In this article, the integrity risk (i.e., localization safety) is rigorously upper bounded by accounting for both nominal sensor noise and other non-nominal sensor faults. An extended Kalman filter is employed to estimate the robot state, and a sequence of innovations is used for fault detection. The novelty of the work includes (1) the use of a time window to limit the number of monitored fault hypotheses while still guaranteeing safety with respect to previously occurring faults and (2) a new method to account for faults in the data association process. © The Author(s) 2020.",2-s2.0-85087075543

Relying on conventional configuration designs to integrate these features into a single robot is challenging. Inspired by octopus crawling, we report a highly agile miniature continuous-elastomer piezoelectric robot (CEPR). Starting from the comparable modal vibration characteristics of ring-shaped structures and extracting their dominant configurations, the robotic square-circular ring structure is created in a module splicing method. The CEPR is easier to miniaturize and fabricate, measuring 28.5 × 28.5 × 7.2 mm3 and weighing 4.3 g.

Moreover, the CEPR possesses enhanced motion performance with linear and rotational speeds reaching 14.3 and 4.01 body lengths per second (BL/s), respectively. Sub-micron and sub-milliradian positioning accuracies are achievable, and the load-to-weight ratio of 47.84 exhibits its strong load-bearing capacity.

"Fault Signal Perception of Nanofiber Sensor for 3D Human Motion Detection Using Multi-Task Deep Learning Once a fault occurs in the nanofiber sensor, the scientific and reliable three-dimensional (3D) human motion detection results will be compromised. It is necessary to accurately and rapidly perceive the fault signals of the nanofiber sensor and determine the type of fault, to enable it to continue operating in a sustained and stable manner. Therefore, we propose a fault signal perception method for 3D human motion detection nanofiber sensor based on multi-Task deep learning. First, through obtaining the fault characteristic parameters of the nanofiber sensor, the fault of the nanofiber sensor is reconstructed to complete the fault location of the nanofiber sensor. Second, the fault signal of the nanofiber sensor is mapped by the penalty function, and the feature extraction model of the fault signal of the nanofiber sensor is constructed by combining the multi-Task deep learning.

"Optimal production and predictive maintenance decisions for deteriorated products under advance-cash-credit payments In the 4th industrial revolution era, manufacturers tend to integrate predictive maintenance into production systems to maximize the lifespan of equipment and avoid costly disruptions. Using internet of things sensors and data analyses, predictive maintenance can significantly reduce the production downtime by detecting and predicting system problems before they become uncontrollable, resulting in a lower defective rate. Additionally, an advance-cash-credit (ACC) payment scheme is commonly applied in real-world business transactions to enhance cash flow flexibility among supply chain members. In this study, we developed a supplier–manufacturer chain, wherein a predictive-maintenance-adopting manufacturer received an ACC payment from a supplier, to demonstrate a supply chain management situation within the imperfect economic production quantity framework. The inventory system of the manufacturer was modeled as a cost minimization problem to determine the optimal replenishment cycle time and predictive maintenance effort for deteriorated products. The proposed model also adopted a discounted cash-flow analysis to consider the time value of the cost function, which was proven to be strictly convex in the replenishment time and predictive maintenance effort. Furthermore, a numerical and sensitivity analysis was conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and gain management insights. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",2-s2.0-85182027148

"Development of a novel sensor for gear teeth wear and damage detection Health monitoring of mechanical transmission systems is an important area of research. Mechanical transmission systems, especially gear boxes in aircraft, automobiles, and wind turbines etc. account for many of the maintenance costs due to repairs, replacements and downtime. Gear boxes can experience high level of failure due to varied load conditions and harsh environments. Replacing the gear box is quite an expensive process and has significant downtime. Current gear box monitoring involves mainly measuring vibrations, however vibrations occur when the fault in the gear has already progressed significantly. Gear teeth monitoring lacks sensor technology to successfully detect tooth damage and misalignment. This paper presents a new concept gear teeth damage detection using eddy current sensors fitted on to the teeth of an idler gear at various locations. These sensors detect various faults encountered in a gear such as micro and macro pitting of the tooth surface, contact wear etc. Eddy current sensors are already being used to detect turbomachinery blade vibrations and tip clearance as they are robust and immune to contamination. In the present case, we use an idler gear that incorporates miniature eddy current sensors and state of the art electronics with wireless data transmission to enable the device to operate remotely and in harsh environments. A rotating rig with gears (spur and helical) and oil supply was built to test and validate the sensor by seeding various faults on the tooth surface. The results show that the idler sensor gear was able to detect various faults.

"Intelligent IoT-Cloud Integrated Wireless RF Framework for Transformer Fault Diagnosis and Predictive Maintenance Transformers play a significant role in the energy management aspect of distribution networks, particularly in the management of energy and voltage regulation. Defeated transformers result in an unsteady power supply, damaged equipment, and economic damage. Old-fashioned monitoring methods depend on excruciatingly slow manual checks that are only done on a reactive basis and are inefficient for advanced fault identification. The amplified need for dependable power highlights the necessity for real-time autonomous transformer efficiency monitoring. The incorporation of the IoT with cloud computing and wireless RF has changed the pace of industrial automation, allowing real-time data capture, monitoring, and maintenance from personnel geographically far away. IoT enables persistent tracking of crucial measurable figures like voltage, current, temperature, and humidity, while LoRa RF is the long-range, low-power radio ideal for electricity transformers situated in isolated regions. Data analytic tools hosted on the cloud easily visualize information, enabling faster maintenance and improved fault diagnosis accuracy. Traditional techniques like DGA, vibration monitoring, and thermal imaging used in fault diagnosis rest upon a feeble premise of slow detection of fault problems, expensive maintenance requirements, and poor flexibility. Our proposal seeks to address the aforementioned issues with an IoT-based Smart Transformer Monitoring System that utilizes machine learning for predictive maintenance, cloud analytics, and an almost limitless range achieved through LoRa RF. While traditional wireless technologies like ZigBee fail to work on transformers due to their range limitation, wired networks suffer from data loss and physical damage, offering no protection against these threats.

"Rethinking maintenance terminology for an industry 4.0 future Sensors and mathematical models have been used since the 1990’s to assess the health of systems and diagnose anomalous behavior. The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) increases the range of assets on which data can be collected cost effectively. Cloud-computing and the wider availability of data and models are democratizing the implementation of prognostic health (PHM) technologies. Together, these advancements and other Industry 4.0 developments are creating a paradigm shift in how maintenance work is planned and executed. In this new future, maintenance will be initiated once a potential failure has been detected (using PHM) and thus completed before a functional failure has occurred. Thus corrective work is required since corrective work is defined as “work done to restore the function of an asset after failure or when failure is imminent.” Many metrics for measuring the effectiveness of maintenance work management are grounded in a negative perspective of corrective work and do not clearly capture work arising from condition monitoring and predictive modeling investments. In this paper, we use case studies to demonstrate the need to rethink maintenance terminology. The outcomes of this work include 1) definitions to be used for consistent evaluation of work management performance in an Industry 4.0 future and 2) recommendations to improve detection of work related to PHM activities. © 2021, Prognostics and Health Management Society.

"Early warning signals of failures in building management systems In the context of sensor data generated by Building Management Systems (BMS), early warning signals are still an unexplored topic. The early detection of anomalies can help preventing malfunctions of key parts of a heating, cooling and air conditioning (HVAC) system that may lead to a range of BMS problems, from important energy waste to fatal errors in the worst case. We analyse early warning signals in BMS sensor data for early failure detection. In this paper, the studied failure is a malfunction of one specific Air Handling Unit (AHU) control system that causes temperature spikes of up to 30 degrees Celsius due to overreaction of the heating and cooling valves in response to an anomalous temperature change caused by the pre-heat coil in winter period in a specific area of a manufacturing facility. For such purpose, variance, lag-1 autocorrelation function (ACF1), power spectrum (PS) and variational autoencoder (VAE) techniques are applied to both univariate and multivariate scenarios. The univariate scenario considers the application of these techniques to the control variable only (the one that displays the failure), whereas the multivariate analysis considers the variables affecting the control variable for the same purpose. Results show that anomalies can be detected up to 32 hours prior to failure, which gives sufficient time to BMS engineers to prevent a failure and therefore, an proactive approach to BMS failures is adopted instead of a reactive one.  © J.J.

"Remaining useful life estimation using neural ordinary differential equations Data-driven machinery prognostics has seen increasing popu-larity recently, especially with the effectiveness of deep learning methods growing. However, deep learning methods lack useful properties such as the lack of uncertainty quantifica-tion of their outputs and have a black-box nature. Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) use neural networks to define differential equations that propagate data from the in-puts to the outputs. They can be seen as a continuous generalization of a popular network architecture used for image recognition known as the Residual Network (ResNet). This paper compares the performance of each network for machinery prognostics tasks to show the validity of Neural ODEs in machinery prognostics. The comparison is done using NASA’s Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (C-MAPSS) dataset, which simulates the sensor information of degrading turbofan engines. To compare both architectures, they are set up as convolutional neural networks and the sensors are transformed to the time-frequency domain through the short-time Fourier transform (STFT).

"Safety monitoring of machinery equipment and fault diagnosis method based on support vector machine and improved evidence theory Safe and reliable operation of machinery is the primary requirement of enterprise production and the basis for realising the economic benefits. Some of the fault diagnosis methods use evidence theory to determine the fault type by collecting the vibration signals. However, in a complex operating environment, the evidence of vibration signal is high-conflict, so it is difficult to obtain the correct fault type. In order to solve this problem, an improved evidence theory-based fault diagnosis method is proposed. First, vibration sensors are used to monitor operating conditions of mechanical equipment and collect vibration signals, and then the dimensionless indicators of these vibration signals are calculated to build the feature dataset. Next, the support vector machine (SVM) is applied to the preliminary fault diagnosis, and the probability of various fault types obtained by the SVM primary fault diagnosis is used as the basic probability assignment (BPA) of evidence. Finally, the improved evidence combination rule based on the Tanimoto coefficient and information entropy is used to fuse the evidence, thus forming the final diagnosis result.

"Supporting the implementation of predictive maintenance – a process reference model The perception of predictive maintenance as a proactive maintenance strategy to anticipate and reduce severe and costly failures and by thus increasing asset reliability has grown significantly in recent years. Due to the availability of machine sensor data and the intention to use these data in a purposeful way, the introduction of predictive maintenance provides a logical step towards maintenance optimization in industry. Several German industrial surveys highlight the growing interest in the topic by the majority of the addressed companies. Nevertheless, most of these companies are considering predictive maintenance on their future agenda and are currently only at the beginning of its implementation. This is, in many cases, due to missing internal knowledge and systematic guidance for maintenance practitioners. Existing process models and supportive guidance build on theoretical knowledge from experts; however, they often lack the complexity and challenges of industrial applications. In addition, most theoretical models focus on specific aspects of the entire process, target particular application areas, or present a few high-level steps. This paper, therefore, introduces the Process Reference Model for Predictive Maintenance (PReMMa), a comprehensive three-stage hierarchical process reference model for the implementation of predictive maintenance for industrial applications. The process reference model synthesizes existing process models as well as results from interviews with eleven practitioners from both management consultancies and experts from several industrial fields. With regard to four main phases and the predictive maintenance application, results are presented with consideration of the essential steps, their deliverables as well as the involved persons. © 2021, Prognostics and Health Management Society.

"A framework for unsupervised learning and predictive maintenance in Industry 4.0 In recent decades, the economic importance of maintaining machines, equipment, and production facilities has prompted many scholars to examine various aspects of the maintenance of physical assets. However, the industry continues to face the recurring problem of improving product and equipment maintenance processes. New opportunities for improving these processes arise from Industry 4.0 technologies because they make it possible to realize better solutions to the problem of predictive maintenance. Starting from a Big Data and Internet of Things (IoT) architecture as a reference, this paper proposes an abstract framework for predictive maintenance using unsupervised learning models to support decision-making in maintenance programs. From the abstract framework, a predictive maintenance system was developed to enable effective just-in-time maintenance strategies. An unsupervised machine learning algorithm, based on the Gauxian mixtures model, allows us to study the influence on a machine’s behavior of a single variable, a group of variables of the same type, and combined variables of different types. The algorithm provides experts with information on which part of the machine they need to focus on to find potential causes of future failures.

"Cross-Validation-Based Multi-Fault Detection of Gas Turbine Operating in harsh environments, gas turbines may encounter a variety of faults. Failure to promptly detect these faults can severely impact their safe and stable operation. During actual operations, accurately detecting the specific location of faults in gas turbines, such as sensors, actuators, or gas paths, to ensure prompt maintenance and safe, stable operation, is a crucial aspect of gas turbine maintenance. To address this issue, this study proposes a multi-fault detection method based on cross-validation. In situations with limited data, we have designed a classification method grounded in logical reasoning and constructed a cross-validation system.

"Fuzzy Observer Design for State and Fault Estimation for Takagi-Sugeno Implicit Models In this study, we develop a fuzzy observer for a class of discrete-time nonlinear implicit models that are described by the Takagi-Sugeno structure and affected by actuator and sensor faults with unmeasurable premise variables satisfying the Lipschitz constraints. This study is based on separating dynamic and static equations in discrete-time Takagi-Sugeno implicit models. The design of a fuzzy observer is proposed to estimate unknown states, actuators, and sensor faults simultaneously. It is designed by considering the fault variables constituted by the actuator and sensor faults as auxiliary state variables. The observer gain is calculated by studying the exponential convergence of the state estimation error using the Lyapunov theory and the stability condition given as a linear matrix inequality.

"Demonstrating a Condition Monitoring Process for Axial Piston Pumps with Damaged Valve Plates Unexpected pump failures in mobile fluid power systems result in monetary and productivity losses, but these failures can be alleviated by implementing a condition monitoring system. This research aims to find the best condition monitoring (CM) technique for a pump with the fewest number of sensors, to accurately detect a defective condition. The sensors choice in a CM system is a critical decision, and a high number of sensors may result in disadvantages besides additional cost, such as overfitting the CM model and increased maintenance. A variable displacement axial piston pump is used as a reference machine for testing the CM technique. Several valve plates with various magnitudes of quantifiable wear and damage are used to compare “healthy” and “unhealthy” hydraulic pumps. The pump parameters are measured on a stationary test rig. This involves observing and detecting differences in pump performance between the healthy and unhealthy conditions and reducing the number of sensors required to monitor a pump’s condition. Observable differences in drain flow were shown, and machine learning algorithms were able to successfully classify a faulty and healthy pump with accuracies nearing 100%. The number of sensors was reduced by implementing a feature selection process and resulted in only five of the 23 sensors to correctly detect pump failure. These sensors measure outlet pressure, inlet pressure, drain pressure, pump speed, and pump displacement. The resulting reduction of sensors is reasonably affordable and relatively easy to implement on mobile applications. © 2022 River Publishers",2-s2.0-85132324412
"Remaining useful life prediction via a deep adaptive transformer framework enhanced by graph attention network Accurate monitoring of mechanical device conditions requires a large number of sensors working together. There are potential connections between sensors throughout the degradation monitoring process of mechanical devices. Conventional deep learning (DL) models suffer from the following shortcomings when dealing with this type of multi-sensor degraded data. To begin with, most existing methods based on DL mainly use CNN as the feature extractor, focusing too much on temporal correlations and ignoring spatial correlations of multiple sensors. Then, the most popular remaining useful life (RUL) model is based on recurrent neural network, which oftentimes suffer from the issue of gradient exploding and vanishing. Therefore, a bran-new end-to-end framework based on a deep adaptative transformer enhanced by graph attention network, named GAT-DAT, is proposed to tackle these weaknesses. First, the graph data is constructed by the correlation of sensors. Next, GAT submodules fuse node features to extract spatial correlation. Finally, the DAT submodule is used to efficiently abstract the temporal features of the data through a self-attention mechanism and adaptively implements RUL prediction for mechanical equipment. Two case studies are employed to attest the efficacy of our proposed GAT-DAT model and the analysis of the experimental data illustrates that the GAT-DAT framework outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85160424249
"Automated Fault Tree Learning from Continuous-valued Sensor Data: A Case Study on Domestic Heaters Many industrial sectors have been collecting big sensor data. With recent technologies for processing big data, companies can exploit this for automatic failure detection and prevention. We propose the first completely automated method for failure analysis, machine-learning fault trees from raw observational data with continuous variables. Our method scales well and is tested on a real-world, five-year dataset of domestic heater operations in The Netherlands, with 31 million unique heater-day readings, each containing 27 sensor and 11 failure variables. Our method builds on two previous procedures: the C4.5 decision-tree learning algorithm, and the LIFT fault tree learning algorithm from Boolean data. C4.5 pre-processes each continuous variable: it learns an optimal numerical threshold which distinguishes between faulty and normal operation of the top-level system. These thresholds discretise the variables, thus allowing LIFT to learn fault trees which model the root failure mechanisms of the system and are explainable. We obtain fault trees for the 11 failure variables, and evaluate them in two ways: quantitatively, with a significance score, and qualitatively, with domain specialists. Some of the fault trees learnt have almost maximum significance (above 0.95), while others have medium-to-low significance (around 0.30), reflecting the difficulty of learning from big, noisy, real-world sensor data. The domain specialists confirm that the fault trees model meaningful relationships among the variables. © Bart Verkuil et al.",2-s2.0-85135139918
"Machine learning supported acoustic emission technique for leakage detection in pipelines Acoustic emission (AE) based method is a very promising passive measurement technique for detection of faults and incipient damage in in-service structures. Considering the advantage of detecting even the weak acoustic signals emitting from in-service critical infra-systems for characterizing the fault/damages/leakage in the structures, AE technique is considered to be one of the efficient NDT techniques. In the present work, acoustic emission technique has been utilised to detect leakage in the pipelines by systematically analysing the signal parameters. The leakage in the pipeline is simulated by means of pressure release valves provided at identified locations. Leakage detection in the pipe is carried out for different rate of leakage through valve. AE signals are measured from the sensors attached to the pipeline and the measured signals are analysed to extract the leakage sensitive acoustic wave features. The AE features evaluated from the acoustic signals are further processed to identify- and localize-the leakage (varying flow rates) in the pipe. Out of all the AE features, AE counts, cumulative AE energy, and signal strength are found to be very sensitive parameters to indicate the leakage in the pipelines. Further, support vector machine (SVM) learning and Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) pattern recognition algorithms are employed to develop the hyperplanes and to classify the leakage by using binary- and multiclass-classifications. Results of the study clearly showed that the SVM and RVM enabled AE features can effectively be utilised for identification and localization of leakage in the pipelines. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85095445741
"A vibration fault diagnosis method for vehicle bearings based on acoustic sensing technology To improve the diagnostic sensitivity of vibration faults of removed bearings, the paper proposes a diagnostic method based on acoustic sensing technology. Firstly, a capacitive sound pressure sensor is used to collect vibration signals of vehicle bearings and perform denoising processing to calculate the modal component change rate of bearing vibration displacement.

"ACO-GCN: A FAULT DETECTION FUSION ALGORITHM FOR WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORK NODES Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has become a solution for real-time monitoring environments and is widely used in various fields. A substantial number of sensors in WSNs are prone to succumb to failures due to faulty attributes, complex working environments, and their hardware, resulting in transmission error data. To resolve the existing problem of fault detection in WSN, this paper presents a WSN node fault detection method based on ant colony optimization-graph convolutional network (ACO-GCN) models, which consists of an input layer, a space-time processing layer, and an output layer. First, the users apply the random search algorithm and the search strategy of the ant colony algorithm (ACO) to find the optimal path and locate the WSN node failures to grasp the overall situation. Then, the WSN fault node information obtained by the GCN model is learned. During the data training process, where the WSN fault node is used for error prediction, the weights and thresholds of the network are further adjusted to increase the accuracy of fault diagnosis. To evaluate the performance of the ACO-GCN model, the results show that the ACO-GCN model significantly improves the fault detection rate and reduces the false alarm rate compared with the benchmark algorithms.

"A Method to Detect and Isolate Brake Rotor Thickness Variation and Corrosion Brake rotors are essential parts of the disc brake systems. Brake rotor thickness variation (RTV) and corrosion are among top failure modes for brake rotors, which may lead to brake judder and pulsation, steering wheel oscillations and chassis vibration. To improve customer satisfaction, vehicle serviceability and availability, it is necessary to develop an onboard fault detection and isolation solution. This study presents a methodology to monitor the state-of-health of brake rotor system to reduce costs associated with scheduled inspection for autonomous fleet or corrective maintenance. We converted the vehicle signals from time-domain to angle-domain and determined health indicators to estimate the RTV level of the rotors. Variance, envelope and order analysis of the brake circuit pressure, longitudinal acceleration and wheel speed sensor signals in angle-domain were promising health indicators to differentiate healthy and faulty rotors. A classification model was developed to fuse the health indicators and estimate the state-of-health of the rotors to report the most degraded rotor with corner isolation. Results showed that using this concept we were able to detect failure levels of 20 microns and larger and meet the customer requirement. Robustness analysis showed that the concept is robust to the noise factors of tire type, tire pressure and vehicle weight. The sensitivity analysis showed that the algorithm is sensitive to two of the calibration parameters (i.e., brake pedal position gradient (BPPG) threshold and the filter order used to derive BPPG) used to determine the brake event and enable the algorithm. © 2023, Prognostics and Health Management Society.

"Improved neural network-based sensor fault detection and estimation strategy for an autonomous aerial vehicle Purpose: This paper aims to design an adaptive nonlinear strategy capable of timely detection and reconstruction of faults in the attitude’s sensors of an autonomous aerial vehicle with greater accuracy concerning other conventional approaches in the literature. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed scheme integrates a baseline nonlinear controller with an improved radial basis function neural network (IRBFNN) to detect different kinds of anomalies and failures that may occur in the attitude’s sensors of an autonomous aerial vehicle. An integral sliding mode concept is used as auto-tune weight update law in the IRBFNN instead of conventional weight update laws to optimize its learning capability without computational complexities. The simulations results and stability analysis validate the promising contributions of the suggested methodology over the other conventional approaches.

"IoT Enabled WSN and Machine Learning Techniques to Surveillance the Smart Irrigation System Farmers try to follow their experience in farming. They will not be aware of the changes that happens in the environment that directly affect the profit as well as the outcome from the farm field. The adoption of smart technologies in farming helps the farmers to utilize resources efficiently. The important resource of farming is water. The consumption of water should be frugal enough to regulate the water supply. The incompetent way of irrigation results in water wastage. Therefore, implementing IoT-enabled WSN techniques allows to moderate the irrigation system known as smart farming or smart agriculture. The smart irrigation system helps to efficiently use the water resource in farming. Sensors are deployed to sense environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity and soil moisture content. The continuous sensed data will be processed and sent to farmers. Based on the data received, farmers decide the water supply to the farm field. Injecting false or incorrect data results in overwatering or under-watering that affects the yield of the farm field directly. Detection of such false data is accomplished using two phases of classification. The two phases of classifications implemented in the proposed scheme are machine learning techniques and fault detection algorithm (FDA). The data that are classified as non-anomalous from the first phase of classification are subjected to the second phase that is FDA. This two-phase of classification concludes that the data received are non-anomalous. This entire classification process is done at the base station (BS). The data that are detected as anomalous either at the first phase or at the second phase are dropped directly without considering for further process. The data that are processed completely at BS will be forwarded to the farmers of the particular farm field. © 2023, Ismail Saritas. All rights reserved.",2-s2.0-85174808237

"RNN-Autoencoder Approach for Anomaly Detection in Power Plant Predictive Maintenance Systems Induced Draft Fans (IDF) and Primary Air Fans (PAF) are critical equipment in steam power plants. Anomaly detection based on machine learning models is an approach that is currently being developed for optimization and increasing the effectiveness of predictive maintenance (PDM) as well as increasing the reliability of thermal power plants. The research aims to develop a data-driven model for diagnostic and prognostic equipment, produce accurate predictions using many sensor data taken in real-time from the SCADA system, and design a PDM management framework using an anomaly detection system. This research proposes to use a combined recurrent neural network (RNN)-autoencoder approach as a ""normal"" behavior model (NBM) with the Mahalanobis Distance (MD) statistical method for the detection of anomalies in power plant equipment. Based on time-series input sensor data, the RNN – autoencoder is utilized to predict the behavior of the equipment in health circumstances. In contrast, the MD is used to determine the distance between the actual parameters of the equipment and its ""normal"" behavior prediction to determine the anomaly condition. This study examined the performance of the long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) models in modeling normal behavior with hyperparameter optimization. The LSTM with the best hyperparameters had a validation loss of 5,690 x 10-4 and a validation accuracy of 93.36 percent, whereas the GRU with the best hyperparameters had a validation loss of 4.484 x 10-4 and a validation accuracy of 93.47 percent.

"Anomaly detection in cyber-physical systems using actuator state transition model Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are vulnerable to cyber attacks which disrupt the operations of the associated physical process. Sensors are deployed in CPS to observe its functioning and control systems like actuators, Remote Terminal Units (RTU), programmable logic controllers (PLC), etc., are used to change the state of the CPS. Any abnormal state transitions due to cyber attack or natural fault may not be detected by the traditional Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Behavior specification-based IDS, which employs laws of physics to detect the intrusion, may be helpful in this context. However, specifying acceptable behaviors based on the laws of physics for all the installed control systems for a complex CPS like a smart grid, water treatment plant, etc., is a challenging task. Here, we employ a data-driven strategy to model the behavior of each control system installed in a CPS. Later, we use the models to predict the acceptable states of all the control systems. We utilize an AI-based classifier to model control systems such as actuators. Subsequently, we juxtapose the actual states of the actuators with their predicted states, examining how this combination correlates with the overall state of the CPS to identify anomalies. Typically, there should be a strong correlation between predicted and actual states, making the Hamming distance between them a crucial factor in our experimentation. To establish the relationship between controller states and CPS states, we employ a novel deep neural network-based approach for classification.

"Dual-sensor blade tip timing with multi-source information and adaptive dictionary update Blade tip timing (BTT) has emerged as a critical non-contact vibration measurement technique, increasingly supplanting traditional strain gauge methods for monitoring the operational safety of high-speed rotating machinery, such as aircraft engines and gas turbines. Despite its advantages, conventional BTT approaches face several limitations: undersampling often leads to the loss of high-frequency signals; the requirement for multiple sensors and stringent layout specifications escalates system complexity and cost; and dependence on a single displacement data source restricts the extraction of comprehensive vibration features. Furthermore, traditional BTT methods lack adaptability to varying operating conditions, impeding accurate signal reconstruction. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes a novel dual-sensor BTT sparse reconstruction method. This approach leverages multi-source information, including both displacement and velocity data, to adapt to diverse operating conditions. It employs a dynamic dictionary update process based on the primary frequency range during sparse reconstruction, eliminating the need for at least four sensors to reconstruct synchronous vibration signals under constant speed conditions. This innovation reduces sensor layout constraints and enhances the robustness and accuracy of signal reconstruction. The proposed method is experimentally validated using dual capacitive and dual eddy current sensors for vibration signal identification. The results indicate that integrating multi-source information significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of vibration signal reconstruction, rendering the method highly effective for health monitoring and fault diagnosis in high-speed rotating machinery. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-105000986235
"Enhanced Multidimensional Nonlinear Correlation via Phase Reconstruction and Broad Learning for Distributed Fusion Detection of Weak Pulse Signals Due to the intricate chaotic environments encountered in distributed sensor applications, such as sea monitoring, machinery fault diagnosis, and EEG weak signal detection, neural networks often face insufficient data to effectively carry out detection tasks. In contrast to traditional machine learning models, a statistical approach employing multidimensional nonlinear correlation (MNC) exhibits an unparalleled signal pattern prediction capability and possesses a streamlined yet robust framework for signal processing. However, the direct application of MNC to weak pulse signal detection remains constrained. To surmount these challenges and achieve high-precision signal detection, we explore a novel MNC approach, integrating phase reconstruction and manifold broad learning, specifically tailored for distributed sensor fusion detection amidst chaotic noise. Initially, the distributed observational data undergoes phase space reconstruction, transforming it into fixed-size arrays. These reconstructed tuples are then processed through the high-dimensional sequence of manifold broad learning, serving as inputs for the nonlinear correlation module to extract spatiotemporal features. Subsequently, a MNC system augmented with a QRS detector layer is devised to predict and classify the presence of a weak pulse signal. This integrated MNC approach, combining phase reconstruction and broad learning, operates within an enhanced feature space of the source domain, realizing detection fusion across distributed sensors through a majority voting principle. Simulation studies and experiments conducted on sea clutter datasets demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of the proposed MNC method, leveraging phase reconstruction and manifold broad learning strategies, for distributed sensor weak pulse signal fusion detection within chaotic backgrounds.

"Feedback-driven error-corrected single-sensor analytics for real-time condition monitoring In this paper, a single-sensor based output-only algorithm is proposed for real-time condition monitoring of mechanical vibrating systems. Four key aspects of real-time condition monitoring and maintenance are presented through Recursive singular spectrum analysis (RSSA): (a) Filtering, (b) Enhancification, (c) Fault detection, and (d) Modal identification. Recent prominence of eigen perturbation (EP) solutions for condition monitoring has led to the development of RSSA as the go-to real-time algorithm for single-sensor diagnosis. As single-sensor econometrics has been long sought as a viable option for cases involving instrumentation redundancies, non-optimal sensor placement, and cost considerations, RSSA provides replication, scalability, and transferability for real-time fault detection studies. With the output vibration signals streaming in real-time, the Hankel covariance matrix is formed which filters out the noise subspace in the grouping stage. Online enhancification becomes particularly useful when the signal statistics are masked by time-varying non-stationary excitation. Application examples involving AM–FM signals and operational noise in structural systems demonstrates the versatility of RSSA towards spatio-temporal fault detection in real-time. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is further validated by experimental investigations of real-time complete modal identification from partial sensor information.

This paper takes the traction system of the CRH2 EMU as the research object, calculates the multi-dimensional fuzzy harmonic closeness of the speed sensor fault signal and the normal signal, and extracts the harmonic interference characteristics. Experimental results show that the diagnostic accuracy of the proposed method is high, the time-consuming is stable below 150 ms, and the packet loss rate is stable at about 2%, which is significantly better than other comparative systems.

"Economic Fault Detection for Axial Piston Pumps Under Variable Operating Conditions This paper presents a method for an economic condition monitoring implementation on axial piston pumps. The vision is to use only one “low-budget” sensor that records as much information as possible. It shows the detection of three typical faults - valve plate cavitation, slipper wear and axial slipper-piston clearance. A variety of sensors were used to collect data on efficiencies, flow rates, temperatures, and accelerations of the new and the faulty pump for 100 different operating conditions. Using a representative set of operating conditions with different speed, pressure and swash plate angle, the faults were predicted for two different machine learning algorithms for different sensors. The triaxial acceleration sensor achieves the best accuracy of 100% with a sampling rate of 16.4 kHz. To further reduce costs, the sampling rate is virtually downsampled until 4.1 kHz, resulting in a drop to 91% prediction accuracy. Moreover, the prediction accuracy for different sets of operating conditions with constant speed, pressure and swash plate angle are compared to each other showing best results for remaining the speed constant. This paper shows, that it is possible to achieve accuracies over 98% on fault detection with only using the y-component of an acceleration sensor with a sampling rate of 4.1 kHz. © 2025 River Publishers.",2-s2.0-105011325648
"Diamond-Coated Mechanical Seal Remaining Useful Life Prediction Based on Convolution Neural Network Reliable remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of industrial equipment key components is of considerable importance in condition-based maintenance to avoid catastrophic failure, promote reliability and reduce cost during the production. Diamond-coated mechanical seal is one of the most critical wearing components in petroleum chemical, nuclear power and other process industries. Estimating the RUL is of critical importance. We consider the data-driven approaches for diamond-coated mechanical seal RUL estimation based on AE sensor data, since it is difficult to construct an explicit mathematical degradation model of seal. The challenges of this work are dealing with the noisy AE sensor data and modeling the degradation process with fluctuation. Faced with these challenges, we propose a pipeline method CDF-CNN to estimate the RUL for mechanical seal: WPD-KLD to raise the signal-to-noise ratio, novel CDF-based statistics to represent seal degradation process and CNN structure to estimate RUL. To acquire AE sensor data, several diamond-coated seals are tested from new to failure in three working conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately predict the RUL of diamond-coated mechanical seal based on AE signals. The proposed prediction method can be generalized to other various mechanical assets. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.",2-s2.0-85071658611
"A Complete Analysis of the New Hyper-thin Sensor for Cartridge Valves Predictive Diagnosis Functional Safety asks for diagnose-ability of systems and components in order to check for faults to be recovered in real time to avoid dangerous consequences of the faults themselves. At the same time, new technologies offer new materials and new production processes, which allow the creation of new sensors to meet the requirements of the functional safety certification. In some applications, the diagnosis of failures is not sufficient for safety requirements, because it is necessary to prevent the occurrence of dangerous failures; for that reason predictive diagnosis would be most desirable. Furthermore, diagnostics and predictive diagnosis are not only related to functional safety, but rather to reliability and function availability, which represent two very important aspects of products quality. Cartridge valves are widely used in many hydraulic systems, both in mobile and in industrial applications, and they are often part of systems that must meet high performance level functional safety requirements. Currently available sensors do not contain information on the state of health of the valve itself and its state with respect to the average life and the distance from a dangerous failure. Besides, there are few sensors directly embedded in valves, with the consequence that the diagnosis of valve faults often comes from inference of information from indirect sensors. This contribution deals with describing an innovative sensor and its ability to detect valve failures before they can occur, even with a reasonable time in advance of the moment in which the fault occurs. These hyper-thin strain gauges sensors fit the valve pole tube and their thickness allows installing them between valve body and coil. The innovation is described and both mechanical, electromagnetic, fabrication, signal conditioning and installation aspects are addressed. Burst and Endurance tests on prototypes are shown to demonstrate the efficacy of sensors for valve condition monitoring. © 2025 River Publishers.",2-s2.0-105011180135
"Facilitating Energy Monitoring and Fault Diagnosis of Pneumatic Cylinders with Exergy and Machine Learning Pneumatic systems are widely used in industrial production sectors. Increasing penetrations of Intelligent Manufacturing and Green Manufacturing are highlighting the drawbacks of pneumatic technology in terms of particularly low energy efficiency and low-level fault diagnosis intelligence. Here we propose that a combined energy-based maintenance and fault diagnostic approach for pneumatic systems could be a game-changer for pneumatics. In this study, a pneumatic cylinder with internal and external leakages is examined and a typical pneumatic experimental system is built. Exergy is adopted for evaluating the available energy of compressed air. Data-driven machine learning models, SAE + SoftMax neural network model and SAE + SVM model, are developed for fault detection and diagnosis. By comparing different machine learning methods with various pressure, flowrate, and exergy data, it is found that the diagnostic accuracy when using pressure and flowrate data is highly dependent on operating conditions, while the diagnostic accuracy when using exergy data is always high regardless of operating conditions. This indicates the promise of developing an exergy-based maintenance paradigm in pneumatic systems. Besides, with exergy and machine learning, more downstream faults can be detected and diagnosed with fewer upstream sensors. This study is the first attempt to develop an exergy-based maintenance paradigm in pneumatic systems. We hope it could inspire the following investigations in other energy domains. © 2023 River Publishers.",2-s2.0-85177982982
"Tool condition monitoring framework for predictive maintenance: a case study on milling process In metal cutting processes, tool condition monitoring has a great importance to prevent surface damage and maintaining the quality of surface finishing. With the development of digitalisation and connection of industrial machines, it has become possible to collect real-time data from various types of sensors (e.g. vibration, acoustic or emission) during the process execution. However, information fusion from multiple sensor signals and tool health prediction still present a big challenge. The aim of this paper is to present a data-driven framework to estimate the tool wear status and predict its remaining useful life by using machine learning techniques. The first part of the framework is dedicated to sensor data preprocessing and feature engineering, while the second part deals with the development of prediction models. Different types of machine learning algorithms are used and compared to find the best result.

"Low- and high-fidelity modeling of sandwich-structured composite response to bird strike, as tools for a digital-twin-assisted damage diagnosis The constant requirement of aerospace industry to enhance the structural efficiency has driven to the usage of high-performance composite materials, either monolithic or sandwich. However, aerospace composite structures are prone to damage due to high-velocity impact events such as bird strike, hail impact, etc. These impact events can result in extensive damage including structure perforation, which will eventually degrade its post-impact residual strength. Therefore, the early detection of damage in composite structure is imperative to avoid catastrophic failure. This paper develops the computational models which predict the dynamic behavior of a helicopter composite sandwich structure undergoing a bird strike. The models are aimed to be used as virtual tools for a future digital-twin-assisted fault detection technique. Firstly, a high-fidelity (HF) FE/SPH model was developed in LS-DYNA, and it was validated against the soft body impact experiments. Afterwards, a computationally efficient low-fidelity (LF) model was developed and correlated with the high-fidelity model. It was concluded that the high-fidelity model can sufficiently accurately predict the strain history experimentally recorded by the FBG sensors, and that size of the predicted delamination area at the front face of the sandwich structure agrees very well with the experimentally observed delamination area. It was also shown that the LF model can rapidly predict the global dynamic response of sandwich panel under the impact loading, through the good agreement between the numerical strain histories with the FBG measurements. Consequently, the LF model can be used as a quick numerical guide for the identification of the loading condition, whereas the HF model can be used as virtual damage detector and estimator of damage extension before the scheduled inspection. © 2021",2-s2.0-85118481169
"Heuristics for Mixed Strength Sensor Location Problems Location-detection problems are pervasive. Examples include the detection of faults in microprocessors, the identification of contaminants in ventilation systems, and the detection of illegal logging in rain forests. In each of these applications a network provides a convenient modelling paradigm. Sensors are placed at particular node locations that, by design, uniquely detect and locate issues in the network. Open locating-dominating (OLD) sets constrain a sensor's effectiveness by assuming that it is unable to detect problems originating from the sensor location. Sensor failures may be caused by extreme environmental conditions or by the act of a nefarious individual. Determining the minimum size OLD set in a network is computationally intractable, but can be modelled as an integer linear program. The focus of this work is the development and evaluation of heuristics for the minimum OLD set problem when sensors of varying strengths are allowed. Computational experience and solution quality are reported for geometric graphs of up to 150 nodes. © 2023 IGI Global. All rights reserved.",2-s2.0-85168090511
"Development of a Real-Time Anomaly Detection System for Dry Vacuum Pumps Using Low-Cost IoT Devices and Machine Learning Data-driven health diagnosis methods based on machine learning have been receiving a lot of attention with the hope that they can open a new era for mechanical researchers and engineers. Machine learning algorithms including deep learning can show insights or state trends through complicated electro-mechanical sensor signals, but it is difficult for machine learning algorithms to go beyond the given data boundaries and to generalize their inferring rules from one case to the other. Researchers have even artificially damaged common mechanical parts in their experiments to collect fault signals for machine learning training. Creating and gathering the sensor signals covering a variety of machine status may be time-consuming or impossible in reality. Anomaly detection for dry vacuum pumps started from the recognition that the artificially induced fault signals may not reflect the natural malfunctioning state of the pumps. Anomaly detection algorithms use only normal data for training, so abnormal state data is not necessarily required. In this research several anomaly detection algorithms were tested and compared with time-domain input features and frequency-domain input features when acceleration signals were injected in for training. A long short-term memory based autoencoder (LSTM-autoencoder) scheme with discrete wavelet transformed (DWT) input signals was chosen for the finalist due to its superior capability capturing the nature of normal state characteristics. The output of LSTM-autoencoder’s loss could be used as an indicator of the machine’s health deterioration. Furthermore, we successfully demonstrated that the developed algorithm worked well on low-cost Internet of Things devices such as Raspberry Pi 4 and Arduino Mega 2560 boards for real-time monitoring. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Korean Society for Precision Engineering 2024.",2-s2.0-85196093064
"Low-cost ultrasonic based object detection and collision avoidance method for autonomous robots This work focuses on the development of an effective collision avoidance algorithm that detects and avoids obstacles autonomously in the vicinity of a potential collision by using a single ultrasonic sensor and controlling the movement of the vehicle. The objectives are to minimise the deviation from the vehicle’s original path and also the development of an algorithm utilising one of the cheapest sensors available for very lost cost systems. For instance, in a scenario where the main ranging sensor malfunctions, a backup low cost sensor is required for safe navigation of the vehicle while keeping the deviation to a minimum. The developed algorithm utilises only one ultrasonic sensor and approximates the front shape of the detected object by sweeping the sensor mounted on top of the unmanned vehicle. In this proposed approach, the sensor is rotated for shape approximation and edge detection instead of moving the robot around the encountered obstacle. It has been tested in various indoor situations using different shapes of objects, stationary objects, moving objects, and soft or irregularly shaped objects. The results show that the algorithm provides satisfactory outcomes by entirely avoiding obstacles and rerouting the vehicle with a minimal deviation. © 2020, The Author(s).",2-s2.0-85091783529
"Predictive maintenance of lead-acid batteries with sparse vehicle operational data Predictive maintenance aims to predict failures in compo-nents of a system, a heavy-duty vehicle in this work, and do maintenance before any actual fault occurs. Predictive maintenance is increasingly important in the automotive industry due to the development of new services and autonomous ve-hicles with no driver who can notice first signs of a compo-nent problem. The lead-acid battery in a heavy vehicle is mostly used during engine starts, but also for heating and cooling the cockpit, and is an important part of the electrical system that is essential for reliable operation. This paper develops and evaluates two machine-learning based methods for battery prognostics, one based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks and one on Random Survival Forest (RSF). The objective is to estimate time of battery failure based on sparse and non-equidistant vehicle operational data, obtained from workshop visits or over-the-air readouts. The dataset has three characteristics: 1) no sensor measure-ments are directly related to battery health, 2) the number of data readouts vary from one vehicle to another, and 3) readouts are collected at different time periods. Missing data is common and is addressed by comparing different imputation techniques. RSF-and LSTM-based models are proposed and evaluated for the case of sparse multiple-readouts. How to measure model performance is discussed and how the amount of vehicle information influences performance. © 2020, Prognostics and Health Management Society.

"Multi-Strategic Trust Evaluation for Intrusion Detection in Wireless Sensor Networks Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have gained a huge research interest due to their nature of deployment and widespread applicability in several applications. However, the distributed deployment nature of WSNs poses several security challenges. In this paper, an Intrusion (Outlier) detection system is proposed based on multi-strategic trust metrics, which is flexible for constantly varying WSN characterized by changes in the variations in direct trust value, recommendations and capacities. Under the multiple strategic trust metrics, this approach considered three trust metrics; they are subjective trust, witness trust and Capacity trust. Furthermore, the capacity trust is modeled as the combination of fault tolerance trust and stability trust. Each node in the network measures the overall trust of its neighbor nodes based on these three metrics and decides whether it is malicious or not. Similarly, among the available routes, one route is finalized which has more Route Trust. Extensive Simulations are conducted over the proposed intrusion detection mechanism and the performance is evaluated through Malicious Detection Rate, False Positive Rate and Packet Delivery Ratio. From the results, we have noticed that the average Malicious Detection Rats of proposed model is 93.4012% while the False Positive rate and Packet Delivery Ratio are observed as 5.5000% and 74.1745% respectively.

"Evaluation of predicted fault tolerance based on C5.0 decision tree algorithm in irrigation system of paddy fields Purpose: Taking into consideration the current human need for agricultural produce such as rice that requires water for growth, the optimal consumption of this valuable liquid is important. Unfortunately, the traditional use of water by humans for agricultural purposes contradicts the concept of optimal consumption. Therefore, designing and implementing a mechanized irrigation system is of the highest importance. This system includes hardware equipment such as liquid altimeter sensors, valves and pumps which have a failure phenomenon as an integral part, causing faults in the system. Naturally, these faults occur at probable time intervals, and the probability function with exponential distribution is used to simulate this interval. Thus, before the implementation of such high-cost systems, its evaluation is essential during the design phase. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed approach included two main steps: offline and online. The offline phase included the simulation of the studied system (i.e. the irrigation system of paddy fields) and the acquisition of a data set for training machine learning algorithms such as decision trees to detect, locate (classification) and evaluate faults. In the online phase, C5.0 decision trees trained in the offline phase were used on a stream of data generated by the system. Findings: The proposed approach is a comprehensive online component-oriented method, which is a combination of supervised machine learning methods to investigate system faults. Each of these methods is considered a component determined by the dimensions and complexity of the case study (to discover, classify and evaluate fault tolerance). These components are placed together in the form of a process framework so that the appropriate method for each component is obtained based on comparison with other machine learning methods. As a result, depending on the conditions under study, the most efficient method is selected in the components. Before the system implementation phase, its reliability is checked by evaluating the predicted faults (in the system design phase). Therefore, this approach avoids the construction of a high-risk system. Compared to existing methods, the proposed approach is more comprehensive and has greater flexibility. Research limitations/implications: By expanding the dimensions of the problem, the model verification space grows exponentially using automata. Originality/value: Unlike the existing methods that only examine one or two aspects of fault analysis such as fault detection, classification and fault-tolerance evaluation, this paper proposes a comprehensive process-oriented approach that investigates all three aspects of fault analysis concurrently. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2-s2.0-85179963202
"Theoretical analysis and potential engineering application of an energy harvester The technique of energy harvesting, which captures the energy from ambient vibrations, has received increasing attention due to its potential to power low-powered wireless sensors. Therefore, it is important to reveal the nonlinear dynamic mechanism to design a high-performance energy harvester. This paper describes an energy harvester with the decoupled bistable potential (DBEH), in which the potential function can be controlled independently by the barrier height or the barrier width. The harmonic balance method (HBM) is used to obtain the theoretical solutions, and the Jacobian matrix is provided to determine their stability. Thirdly, this paper thoroughly discusses the influence of barrier height and width on output responses and the multi-solution range. Finally, numerical simulations observe the stochastic resonance (SR) phenomenon and the inverse SR phenomenon of the DBEH with Gaussian white noise injection. The SR phenomenon of the DBEH is applied to bearing fault diagnosis, effectively enhancing fault characteristics. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85190738390
"Data-driven approach for labelling process plant event data An essential requirement in any data analysis is to have a response variable representing the aim of the analysis. Much academic work is based on laboratory or simulated data, where the experiment is controlled, and the ground truth clearly defined. This is seldom the reality for equipment performance in an industrial environment and it is common to find issues with the response variable in industry situations. We discuss this matter using a case study where the problem is to detect an asset event (failure) using data available but for which no ground truth is available from historical records. Our data frame contains measurements of 14 sensors recorded every minute from a process control system and 4 current motors on the asset of interest over a three year period. In this situation the ``how to'' label the event of interest is of fundamental importance. Different labelling strategies will generate different models with direct impact on the in-service fault detection efficacy of the resulting model. We discuss a data-driven approach to label a binary response variable (fault/anomaly detection) and compare it to a rule-based approach. Labelling of the time series was performed using dynamic time warping followed by agglomerative hierarchical clustering to group events with similar event dynamics. Both data sets have significant imbalance with 1,200,000 non-event data but only 150 events in the rule-based data set and 64 events in the data-driven data set. We study the performance of the models based on these two different labelling strategies, treating each data set independently. We describe decisions made in window-size selection, managing imbalance, hyper-parameter tuning, training and test selection, and use two models, logistic regression and random forest for event detection. We estimate useful models for both data sets. By useful, we understand that we could detect events for the first four months in the test set. However as the months progressed the performance of both models deteriorated, with an increasing number of false positives, reflecting possible changes in dynamics of the system. This work raises questions such as ``what are we detecting?'' and ``is there a right way to label?'' and presents a data driven approach to support labelling of historical events in process plant data for event detection in the absence of ground truth data. © 2022, Prognostics and Health Management Society.

"A deep learning approach for integrated production planning and predictive maintenance This paper considers a multi-period multi-product capacitated lot-sizing problem. It develops an integrated predictive maintenance and production planning framework using deep learning and mathematical programming. The objective is to minimise the sum of maintenance, setup, holding, backorder, and production costs, while satisfying the demand for all products over the horizon under consideration. Based on a rolling horizon approach, the model dynamically integrates data-driven predictive maintenance and production planning. The used maintenance policy includes replacements and minimal repairs that are considered as preventive and corrective maintenance, respectively. To select preventive maintenance actions, a long short-term memory model is employed to accurately predict the health condition of the machine. Each rolling horizon consists of ordinary and forecast stages, and by collecting new sensor data, the maintenance and production decisions are simultaneously updated. The resulting integrated framework is validated using a benchmarking data set.

"Knowledge-based and Expert Systems in Prognostics and Health Management: a Survey Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) has become increasingly popular in recent years, and data-driven methods and artificial intelligence have emerged as dominant tools within the PHM field. This trend is mainly due to the increasing use of sensors and the ability of machine learning techniques to leverage condition monitoring data. However, despite their utility and effectiveness, these techniques are not without draw-backs. One major issue is that data-driven methods often lack transparency in their reasoning, which is crucial for understanding fault occurrences and diagnostics. Additionally, the availability of data can be a challenge. In some cases, data are scarce or hard to obtain, either due to the cost of installing necessary sensors or the rarity of the required in-formation. Lastly, the insights derived from data can some-times diverge from those obtained through expert analysis and established norms. This contrasts with knowledge-based approaches such as expert systems, which formally organize the knowledge acquired from norms and experts, and then de-duce the desired conclusion. While research is increasingly exploring data-driven techniques, industry tends to still fre-quently employ knowledge-based methods. To fill this gap, this paper offers a detailed survey of knowledge-based and expert systems in PHM, examining methodologies such as propositional logic, fuzzy logic, Dempster-Shafer theory and Bayesian networks. It assesses the integration and impact of these techniques in PHM for fault detection, diagnosis and prognosis, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and potential future developments.

"FAILURE DETECTION USING AN EXTENDED SEMI-STRONGLY STABILIZING CONTROLLER WITH A POLE AT THE ORIGIN AND TWO PAIRS OF POLES ON THE IMAGINARY AXIS To make control systems stable using a stable controller is called the strongly stabilization. The strongly stabilizing controller, which is a stable controller that makes the system internally stable, is often used to make the control system stable even if a sensor or actuator fails for stable plants. However, the strongly stabilizing controller has some problems: not make the output follow the step reference input or sinusoidal reference input, and not make the step disturbance or sinusoidal disturbance be attenuate. This is because the strongly stabilizing controller is not able to have poles at the origin and on the imaginary axis. Since sinusoidal inputs are often used to detect the faulty in some reliable control system design, it is important to overcome problems that the strongly stabilizing controller has. To overcome these problems, the extended strongly stabilizing controller, which has a pole at the origin and two pairs of poles on the imaginary axis, has been proposed. Using the extended strongly stabilizing controller, we can construct a reliable control system that has failure detection and follows the output to the reference input. In this paper, we propose a control system with failure detection without an error between the output and the reference input by using the extended semi-strongly stabilizing controller that has a pole at the origin and two pairs of poles on the imaginary axis. © 2024, ICIC International.

Modern technologies like IoT and cyber-physical systems are transforming product quality assurance, making it faster, more efficient, and adaptable to environments. This paper advocates for using cyber-physical systems (CPS) in production industries to enhance quality assurance. The reasons include ensuring production consistency, increasing efficiency, cutting costs by minimizing manual labor and inspections, improving defect detection accuracy, and offering scalability for evolving production demands. This paper, therefore, introduces a CPS system to assure product quality. For the experimental investigation, the paper used the casting product of defective and non-defective samples. A machine learning model is presented for quality assurance. The model is termed a stepwise noise removal and learning model (SNRLM) in which a digital filter is used to remove the noise from the captured product images.

"How to Select Algorithms for Predictive Maintenance: An Economic Decision Model and Real-World Instantiation Predictive maintenance represents a promising application of Artificial Intelligence in the industrial context. The evaluation and selection of predictive maintenance algorithms primarily rely on statistical measures such as absolute and relative prediction errors. However, a purely statistical approach to algorithm selection may not necessarily lead to the optimal economic outcome, as the two types of prediction errors are negatively correlated, thus, cannot be jointly optimized, and are associated with different costs. As the current literature lacks corresponding guidance, we developed a decision model for industrial full-service providers, applying an economic perspective to selecting predictive maintenance algorithms. The decision model was instantiated and evaluated in a real-world setting with a European machinery company providing full-service solutions in the field of car wash systems. Building on sensor data from 4.9 million car wash cycles, the instantiation demonstrates the applicability and effectiveness of the decision model with fidelity to a real-world phenomenon. In sum, the decision model provides economic insights into the trade-off between the algorithms' error types and enables users to focus on economic concerns in algorithm selection.

"Design of an IoT platform for data analytics based fault detection and classification in solar PV power plants using CFKC and ODENN New policies are commenced all over the globe to diminish the use of fossil fuels, which gives rise to the augmented utilization of solar energy (SE). The photovoltaic (PV) system's performance is extremely environmental variables reliant. Long-range transmission of SE is incompetent as well as complex to carry in the PV system. It can be affected by disparate sorts of faults, which cause severe energy loss all through the system operation. Thus, it is vital to incessantly monitor the solar PV (SPV) system to detect as well classify the faults by preventing energy losses. The IoT applications in SE production engage sensor devices that are fixed to the generation, and transmission, together with distribution equipment. These devices assist in monitoring the operation of the SPV power plant (SPVPP) system remotely in real-time. Presenting a new algorithm that can perform fault detection and classification in a PV system to a higher level of accuracy is the major contribution of this work. Thus, this work designs as well as develops an IoT platform for carrying out analytical tasks that can analyze data generated as of IoT operating systems to detect as well as classify faults in the SPVPP.

This model will be used to generate data for building a data-driven mode. Thus, the combination of these two models provides the hybrid model-based approach (HyMAs). The physics-based model of the HVAC system is divided into four principal parts: cooling subsystems, heating subsystems, ventilation subsystems, and vehicle thermal networking. First, the subsystems are modelled, considering the sensors embedded in the real system. Next, the model is synchronised with the real system to give better simulation results and validate the model. The cooling subsystem, heating subsystem and ventilation subsystem are validated with the acceptable sum square error (SSE) results. Second, the new virtual sensors are defined in the model, and their value to future research is suggested. Copyright © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",2-s2.0-85108869435
"Advanced Artificial Intelligence Drivers and IoT Network Systems for Data Collection and Network Transmission in the Industry 5.0 Era The primary bases of Industry 5.0, the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and big data (BD) may serve as a basis for applying the concepts of smart manufacturing, innovative goods and services, and predictive maintenance (PDM) into practice. Assessing the remaining useful life of components using failure data and state monitoring information constitutes the AI techniques for predictive maintenance (PDM), which are critical in Industry 5.0. However, it is sometimes challenging to identify the annotation of component usage, creating an open problem for obtaining accurately labeled information and understanding it. This problem needs to be rectified if Industry 5.0 progress is proceeded with. In order to solve the PDM job, this study presents a new data-driven decision system (DDS) based on AI that overcomes the earlier issue. It does by concentrating on an actual industrial use scenario that involves modern processing and monitoring machines. Specifically, the most fundamental components of the recommended DDS include cloud-based storage, data interpretation, predictive modeling, recognition of features using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and data collecting. An efficient prediction model called the unique moth flame search-tuned light gradient boosting machine (MFS-LGBM) technique is presented in this work. By enabling the ongoing gathering of identified samples and offering a data analysis environment to assist the maintainer/operator, the suggested approach resolves the PDM task. The research findings showed that when compared to the previous approaches, the suggested approach accomplishes the greatest conceivable balance between comprehension, computational effort, and forecasting accuracy in terms of quality estimation. Based on the suggested methodology, the performance is examined in terms of RMSE (600.10), MAE (390.60), R2 (0.790) and MAPE (25.70) measures. By incorporating it into the cloud structure, the suggested technique minimizes maintenance expenses and enhances production efficiency by improving machining processes, assisting maintainers, and delivering current operating risk alerts.  © 2025 World Scientific Publishing Company.",2-s2.0-85209711518
"Fatigue monitoring and maneuver identification for vehicle fleets using a virtual sensing approach Extensive monitoring comes at a prohibitive cost, limiting Predictive Maintenance strategies for vehicle fleets. This paper presents a measurement-based virtual sensing technique where local strain gauges are only required for few reference vehicles, while the remaining fleet relies exclusively on accelerometers. The scattering transform is used to perform feature extraction, while principal component analysis provides a reduced, low dimensional data representation. This enables direct fatigue damage regression, parameterized from unlabeled usage data. Identification measurements allow for a physical interpretation of the reduced representation.

"Fuzzy based Reliable Data Collection and Communication in Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) Networks Enhancing the efficiency of Internet of Things (IoT) operations is the primary objective of Artificial Intelligence for Things. In harsh environments, IoT nodes are prone to failures due to hardware faults, battery depletion and external events etc. By analyzing the correctness and quality of received data, the IoT device’s quality can be assessed. In this paper, Fuzzy based reliable data collection and communication (FRDCC) is proposed. For detecting the data faults, each device applies machine learning based Autoencoder technique. The fault detection module receives the device readings as input which is then used to monitor the data correctness. In order to ensure reliable data collection and transmission, a set of data collectors are determined by applying Fuzzy logic model. The variables queue size, total energy consumption and reliability index are considered as fuzzy inputs and the selection probability is returned as the Fuzzy output.

"RUL Prognostics: Recursive Bayesian Ensemble Prediction with Combining Artificial Degradation Patterns With the rising complexity of manufacturing processes, resulting from rapid industrial development, the utilization of remaining useful lifecycle (RUL) prediction, based on failure physics and traditional reliability, has remained limited. Although data-driven approaches of RUL prediction were developed using machine learning algorithms, uncertainty-induced challenges have emerged, such as sensor noise and modeling error. To address these uncertainty-induced problems, this study proposes a stochastic ensemble-modeling concept for improving the RUL prediction result. The proposed ensemble model combines artificial degradation patterns and fitness weights, which incorporate formulas reflecting failure patterns and various reliability function data with the observed degradation factor. Furthermore, a recursive Bayesian updating technique, reflecting the difference between expected and observed remaining life sequentially, was leveraged to reduce the prediction uncertainty. Moreover, we comparatively studied the predictive performance of the proposed model (recursive Bayesian ensemble model) against an existing baseline method (exponentially weighted linear regression model). Through simulation and case datasets, this experiment demonstrated the robustness and utility of the proposed algorithm. © 2023, Prognostics and Health Management Society.

"Fault-tolerant control with high-order sliding mode for manipulator robot The safety of manipulators systems is receiving a lot of attention these days. Faults have the ability to carry out harmful activities that harm equipment, the environment, or persons. As a result, it is critical to detect and diagnose problems as soon as possible, as well as to incorporate fault tolerance to avoid performance deterioration and harmful circumstances. Robust sensor fault detection and isolation (FDI) as well as fault-tolerant control (FTC) for a robotic system are discussed in this work. The goal of this research is to create an FDI method that uses a super-twisting third-order sliding mode (STW-TOSM) observer to estimate residual signals. A suggested system based on a higher-order sliding mode (HOSM) observer/controller approaches is used to accomplish this.

"Anomaly detection and circuit-based categorisation of fault in PV systems This paper includes the hybrid technique for anomaly detection and fault diagnosis in the PV systems. The sensor-based and sensorless fault detection techniques (FDTs) are not applicable in case of multiple fault detection in each string at the same time. The existing sensor-based FDTs have no alternative option in case of sensor failure conditions. To overcome the discussed problem, a hybrid technique is designed to prevent the PV system from serious fire hazards. The fault detection in case of sensor failure events can be solved by the sensorless anomaly detection technique. Furthermore, maximum power points-based anomaly technique uses the inflection point to identify the partial shading and fault conditions. To categorise the multiple fault conditions the n-th numbers of voltage sensors are used for n number of strings.

"Condition Monitoring of an Axial Piston Pump on a Mini Excavator The locus of this paper is to show the process of developing a condition monitoring system for an axial piston pump mounted on a mini excavator. This work outlines some previous condition monitoring work on axial piston pumps but addresses the lack of research conducted on mobile hydraulics. The valve plate of the pump is chosen as a case study to demonstrate varying degrees of wear and damage to represent healthy and faulty pump conditions. The wear and damage of these valve plates is measured using an optical profilometer, and efficiency measurements were conducted to characterize the fault levels. Once the faults were characterized, the mini excavator was introduced and instrumented to demonstrate what parameters were being considered. Next, three duty cycles were introduced: controlled, digging, and different operator cycles. The controlled cycles are a very repeatable condition that eliminated the need of an operator. The digging cycle was more of a realistic cycle where an operator dug into a loose pile of soil. The different operator cycle is the same as the digging cycle, but a different operator was employed. The sensors that proved to be the most useful in delecting valve plate faults were the drain pressure, pump port pressures, engine speed, and pump displacement. Fault deteclabilily accuracies of 100% were achievable under the controlled cycle utilizing the Fine KNN classification machine learning algorithm. The digging cycle could achieve a fault detection accuracy of 93.6% using the same algorithm and sensors. Finally, the cross-compatibility between a model trained under once cycle and using data from another cycle as an input was investigated. This study showed that a model trained under the controlled duty cycle does not give reliable and accurate fault delectability for data run in a digging cycle, below 60% accuracies. However, cross-compatibility may be achievable if more extreme faults are present. This work concluded by recommending a diagnostic function for mobile machines to perform a preprogrammed operation to reliably and accurately delect pump faults. © 2023 River Publishers.",2-s2.0-85161847216
"Fault detection and power quality analysis of wind turbine system using integrated systems Growth in the need for electric energy and fossil fuel scarcity endorses renewable energy generation sources. The generation cost of electric power utilizing wind turbines is cost-effective and straightforward compared to other renewable energy sources (RES). Recently, hasty research and developments have been presented in wind turbines (WT) by researchers globally. Although wind-based energy production is more content, planting the WT is challenging. Maintaining the WT from fault incidence is highly crucial. The fault in the WT distresses the power quality of the produced energy. This condensed power quality affects the transmission systems, substations, and loading end of the renewable source. Also, gear malfunctioning is the primary reason for most of the downtime in wind turbines. This work successfully proposed and implemented a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing-based control technique to reduce the drive train vibration. Therefore, fault detection and monitoring in WTs play an active part in power production and quality maintenance. In this work, a vibration-grounded WT gearbox fault observing scheme is proposed to increase the power quality. Precisely, a wavelet is executed to chart the vibration gesture.

"Optimized dual path analysis using finite automata theory in wireless sensor networks Purpose: With the rapid growth of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), they have become an integral and substantial part of people's life. As such WSN stands as an assuring outlook, but because of sensor's resource limitations and other prerequisites, optimal dual route discovery becomes an issue of concern. WSN along with central sink node is capable of handling wireless transmission, thus optimizing the network's lifetime by selecting the dual path. The major problem confronted in the application of security mechanisms in WSNs is resolving the issues amid reducing consumption of resources and increases security. Design/methodology/approach: According to the proposed system, two metrics, namely, path length and packets delivery ratio are incorporated for identifying dual routes amid the source and destination. Thereafter by making use of the distance metric, the optimal dual route is chosen and data transmission is carried out amid the nodes. With the usage of the recommended routing protocol high packet delivery ratio is achieved with reduced routing overhead and low average end to end delay. It is clearly portrayed in the simulation output that the proposed on demand dual path routing protocol surpasses the prevailing routing protocol. Moreover, security is achieved make use of in accord the data compression reduces the size of the data. With the help of dual path, mathematical model of Finite Automata Theory is derived to transmit data from source to destination. Finite Automata Theory comprises Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) that is being utilized for Dual Path Selection. In addition, data transition functions are defined for each input stage. In this proposed work, another mathematical model is 10; introduced to efficiently choose an alternate path between a receiver and transmitter for data transfer with qualified node as relay node using RR Algorithm. It also includes Dynamic Mathematical Model for Node Localization to improve the precision in location estimation using Node Localization Algorithm. As a result a simulator is built and various scenarios are elaborated for comparing the performance of the recommended dual path routing protocol with respect to the prevailing ones. Findings: Reliability and fault-tolerance: The actual motive in utilizing the approach of multipath routing in sensor network was to offer path resilience in case of a node or link failures thus ascertaining reliable transmission of data. Usually in a fault tolerant domain, when the sensor node is unable to forward the data packets to the sink, alternative paths can be utilized for recovering its data packets during the failure of any link/node. Load balancing: Load balancing involves equalizing energy consumption of all the existing nodes, thereby degrading them together. Load balancing via clustering improves network scalability. The network's lifetime as well as reliability can be extended if varied energy level's nodes exist in sensor node. Quality of service (QoS): Improvement backing of quality of service with respect to the data delivery ratio, network throughput and end-to-end latency stands very significant in building multipath routing protocols for various network types. Reduced delay: There is a reduced delay in multipath routing since the backup routes are determined at the time of route discovery. Bandwidth aggregation: By dividing the data toward the same destination into multiple streams (by routing all to a separate path) can aggregate the effective bandwidth. The benefit being that, in case a node possesses many links with low bandwidth, it can acquire a bandwidth which is more compared to the individual link. Research limitations/implications: Few more new algorithms can be used to compare the QoS parameters. Practical implications: Proposed mechanism with feedback ascertains improvised delivery ratio compared to the single path protocol since in case of link failure, the protocol has alternative route. In case there are 50 nodes in the network, the detection mechanism yields packet delivery of 95% and in case there are 100 nodes, the packet delivery is lowered to 89%. It is observed that the packet rate in the network is more for small node range. When the node count is 200, the packet ratio is low, which is lowered to 85%. With a node count of 400, the curve depicts the value of 87%. Hence, even with a decrease in value, it is superior than the existing protocols. The average end-to-end delay represents the transmission delay of the data packets that have been successfully delivered as depicted in Figure 6 and Table 3. The recommended system presents the queue as well as the propagation delay from the source to destination. The figure depicts that when compared to the single path protocol, the end-to-end delay can be reduced via route switching. End-to-end delay signifies the time acquired for the delay in the receival of the the retransmitted packet by each node. The comparison reveals that the delay was lower compared to the existing ones in the WSN. Proposed protocol aids in reducing consumption of energy in transmitter, receiver and various sensors. Comparative analysis of energy consumptions of the sensor in regard to the recommended system must exhibit reduced energy than the prevailing systems. Originality/value: On demand dual path routing protocol. Hence it is verified that the on demand routing protocol comprises DFA algorithms determines dual path. Here mathematical model for routing between two nodes with relay node is derived using RR algorithm to determine alternate path and thus reduce energy consumption. Another dynamic mathematical model for node localization is derived using localization algorithm. For transmitting data with a secure and promising QoS in the WSNs, the routing optimization technique has been introduced. The simulation software environment follows the DFA. The simulation yields in improvised performance with respect to packet delivery ratio, throughput, average end-to-end delay and routing overhead. So, it is proved that the DFA possesses the capability of optimizing the routing algorithms which facilitates the multimedia applications over WSNs. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2-s2.0-85084501458

"CONSTRUCTION OF AN ELECTROMECHANICAL AUTOMATION AND FAULT DIAGNOSIS SYSTEM USING DATA-DRIVEN TECHNOLOGY IN THE CONTEXT OF BIG DATA The sensor faults in electromechanical equipment are diagnosed and predicted to accelerate the industrial automation and stable operation of electromechanical equipment. Firstly, several basic fault prediction methods are introduced, and the data of electromechanical equipment during production can be well diagnosed and processed through data-driven technology. Secondly, the principal component analysis (PCA) method is introduced, and accordingly, the optimized dynamic principal component analysis (DPCA) method and several common sensor faults are proposed. Thirdly, the specific steps of the PCA and DPCA methods are discussed in sensor faults diagnosis, respectively. The PCA method can study the multivariate nonlinear data concurrently. On this basis, the optimized DPCA method can analyse the dynamic features of the real-time data collected by sensors. Finally, the fault type that produces a fixed deviation is studied. Then, the experiment of the draw-wire displacement sensor is simulated through the optimized PCA and DPCA. The square prediction error (SPE) and prediction-error rate are compared with the error. The results show that both methods can predict the fault of the sensor. The results of the T2 statistics obtained through the PCA show that the sensor fault can be effectively predicted, but the prediction-error rate and fault-omission rate are also high. In the DPCA algorithm, the SPE statistics show that the DPCA algorithm can predict the fault with a small prediction-error rate and fault-omission rate, which is far lower than the PCA algorithm. Therefore, dynamic factors analysis can improve sensor fault prediction, which is of great significance to the acceleration of industrial automation and equipment intelligence. © 2021, Cefin Publishing House.

"Evaluating Image Classification Deep Convolutional Neural Network Architectures for Remaining Useful Life Estimation of Turbofan Engines Accurate estimation of the remaining useful life (RUL) is a key component of condition-based maintenance (CBM) and prognosis and health management (PHM). Data-based models for the estimation of RUL are of particular interest because expert knowledge of systems is not always available, and physical modeling is often not feasible. Additionally, using data-based models, which make decisions based on raw sensor data, allow features to be learned instead of man-ually determined. In this work, deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures are investigated for their abil-ity to estimate the RUL of turbofan engines. To improve the accuracy of the models, CNN architectures, which have proven successful in image classification, are implemented and tested. Specifically, the blocks used in the Visual Ge-ometry Group (VGG) architecture, inception modules used in the GoogLeNet architecture, and residual blocks used in the ResNet architecture are incorporated. To account for varying flight lengths, the input to the models is a window of time series data collected from the engine under test. Window locations at the climb, cruise, and descent stages are considered. To further improve the RUL estimations, multiple overlapping windows at each location are used. This increases the amount of training data available and is found to increase the accuracy of the resulting RUL estimations by averaging the estimates from all overlapping segments. The model is trained and tested using the new Commercial Mod-ular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (N-CMAPSS) data set, and high prognosis accuracy was achieved.

"Long-term predictive opportunistic replacement optimisation for a small multi-component system using partial condition monitoring data to date The advanced condition monitoring tools and sensors have changed the decision making on maintenance in modern manufacturing. To face the change, an integrated ‘prognostics-replacement’ framework is proposed to optimise the replacement decision from component-level layer into production system-level layer by using condition monitoring data in this paper. Some special situations such as no failure or suspension histories of many of same or similar components for prognosis, etc., are considered. A novel degradation prediction model is introduced and the failure risk of a component is estimated based on its degradation level and service time. A total current-term cost rate function is defined to determine the replacement clusters and time for performing replacement from an integrated and economic view. A conservative window is used to adjust the replacement time and overcome the prognostic results varying at different inspection time in a long task. To optimise the replacement clusters effectively, a random-keys genetic algorithm (GA) based on convex set theory is developed. The proposed framework is validated by different small systems.

"Anomaly Detection for Early Failure Identification on Automotive Field Data The automotive industry is witnessing its next phase of transformation. The vehicles are getting defined by software, becoming intelligent, connected and more complex to design, develop and analyze. For these complex vehicles, prognostics and proactive maintenance has become ever more critical than before. OEMs and suppliers analyze probable failures that a vehicle component is likely to encounter, define fault codes to identify those failures, and provide procedure or guided steps to resolve them. For smarter vehicles, it is required that vehicles be capable to catch potential problems as soon as the component’s condition starts to deteriorate and becomes a failure. These failures could be known (defined) or new (undefined). Given the vehicle development timelines and increasing complexity, many problems are not analyzed at design stage and remain undetected before production. Hence, no fault code or test case exist for them. Diagnosing such problems become very difficult, postproduction. The aim of this paper is to propose a Machine Learning (ML) based framework which utilizes minimally labelled or unlabeled sensor data generated from a vehicle system at a given frequency. The framework utilizes an ML model to identify any anomalous behavior or aberration, and flag it for further review. This framework can be adopted on large amount of real time or time series data to identify known as well as undefined failures early. These models could be deployed on cloud or on edge (on vehicles) for analyzing real-time sensor data for a given system/component and flag any anomaly.

A Video of an Airborne Image Recording System (AIRS) is used to process in obtaining the results. By using this method, there is a wide scope of detection of a much greater number of parameters, i.e., typically to the tune of 150 to 200. As of now, The Aircraft incidents/accidents are investigated based on the evidence provided by the two flight recorders, namely, Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) and FDR.

"A method for fault prediction of air brake system in vehicles Fault diagnosis is a complex problem that concerns effective decision-making. Air brake system is a crucial safety unit and failure of which leads to the loss of vehicle yaw stability and increase in stopping distance of the vehicle. Fault detection and isolation in brake system is critical for continuity of the performance and the safe running of autonomous vehicles.

The rough set reduction principle is applied to find all reducts, and then a set of generalized classification rules for predicting the faults of Air brake system was extracted. The results show that the presented method can effectively enrich the vehicle condition monitoring system, able to give a feedback to the driver regarding the working condition of air brake system, detect and identify the location of faults, minimize the resources, such as time, cost of maintenance, etc. © International Research Publication House.",2-s2.0-85087387721
"A new Online Hall Effect Sensor Fault Detection and Location in Brushless DC Motor Based on Normalized Phases Currents Analysis In this paper, a new online technique for Hall Effect sensor fault diagnosis in brushless DC (BLDC) motor is proposed. The proposed technique is based on phase current waveform analysis and does not need any Hall sensor information. The normalized phases current values are analyzed per and post-sensor fault in every cycle. Using a definition of suitable conditions and threshold values for normalized currents values, all sensor fault types (i.e. set to 0 and 1) could be detected and located online effectively. The main contribution of this paper is introducing an online BLDC sensor fault detection and location technique under low-speed operation and transient conditions. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed technique in all of the sensor faults types diagnosis without any sensor output value information. Two different types of BLDC motors are considered for fault diagnosis using the proposed technique. Simulation results during starting and low-speed operations of BLDC motor are well confirmed by the experimental results. ©2023 The author(s).",2-s2.0-85173854009
"Nonlinear observer-based exhaust manifold pressure estimation and fault detection for gasoline engines with exhaust gas recirculation This article presents a nonlinear observer-based method to estimate the exhaust manifold pressure for the gasoline engines equipped with an exhaust gas recirculation system. A dynamic model is designed to estimate the exhaust manifold pressure, which includes both the intake manifold and exhaust manifold dynamics focusing on gas mass flows. Based on the developed model, a nonlinear exhaust manifold pressure observer is proposed to replace the exhaust manifold pressure sensor, and the global convergence is analyzed by a constructed Lyapunov function and the physical meaning of the time-varying parameters. The experimental validations show that the observer-based exhaust manifold pressure estimator is able to converge to the real value at arbitrary initial value and estimates the exhaust manifold pressure accurately during both the steady-state and transient conditions. Finally, the proposed exhaust manifold pressure observer is applied into the fault detection problem for the exhaust gas recirculation system. The experimental validations show that the observer is able to be used to estimate the exhaust gas recirculation ratio and as an extra signal to assist to detect the faults of the exhaust gas recirculation system accurately. © IMechE 2019.",2-s2.0-85074556454
"A novel methodology for marine dual fuel engines sensors diagnostics and health management The sensors abnormalities, faults, failure detection and diagnosis for marine engines are considered crucial for ensuring the engine safe and smooth operation. The development of such system(s) is typically based on the manufacturers experience on sensors and actuators faults and failure events. This study aims to introduce a novel methodology for the sensors diagnostics and health management in marine dual fuel engines by employing a combination of thermodynamic, functional control and data-driven models. The concept of an Engine Diagnostics System (EDS) is developed to provide intelligent engine monitoring, advanced sensors’ faults detection as well as timely and profound corrective actions. This system employs a neural networks (NN) Data-Driven (DD) model along with appropriate logic controls. The DD model is set up based on the derived steady state data from a thermodynamic model of high fidelity and is capable of real-time prediction of the engine health condition behaviour. The concept of a novel Unified Digital System (UDS) is proposed that combines the engine’s existing control and diagnostic systems with the EDS. The functionality of the UDS system is validated by employing a digital twin of the considered marine dual fuel engine by investigating scenarios for assessing the engine performance that entail abnormalities in the engine’s speed and boost pressure sensors. The simulation results demonstrate that the developed UDS is capable of sufficiently capturing the engine’s sensors abnormalities and applying appropriate corrective actions to restore the engine operation in its original state. This study benefits the development future systems facilitating the engines condition assessment and self-correction of the engine sensors’ abnormalities, which will be required for smart and autonomous shipping. © IMechE 2021.",2-s2.0-85101236961
"Machine Learning Technics for Remaining useful Life Prediction using Diagnosis Data: a Case Study of a Jaw Crusher Predictive maintenance currently involves digital transformation with all the technologies developed to serve the latter. This maintenance strategy is believed to be an efficient solution to end late/early intervention issues. It is for this reason that machine health state monitoring by Remaining Useful Life prognosis is very crucial. However, in the literature, most studies focus on failure diagnosis more than the system's Remaining Useful Life. In addition, to prepare models to serve the prognosis, the use of actual machinery data is critical to assure the later scalability of the application. The literature about predictive maintenance has often evaluated data-driven approaches with machine learning techniques processing simulated Data rather than real ones. To tackle this problem, the authors propose a continuity of previous work treating a jaw crusher default diagnosis in the context of the ore mining industry. The RUL of the crusher components is estimated upon completion of the fault diagnosis data. Smart sensors Data have been preprocessed to serve the evaluation of four regression machine learning models: Bayesian Linear Regression, Poisson Regression, Neural Network Regression, and Random Forest. Poisson regression and Neural Network required data normalization in this case study to improve their performance. Linear regression methods proved their inability to forecast the machine degradation state, while the bagging ensemble method, Random Forest, was able to track the actual values. This paper aims to enhance the Prognosis and Health Management of the machine while contributing to the literature enhancement on failure prognosis using real industrial data. © 2022 The authors.",2-s2.0-85141211408
