Abstract: """"""Diagnosability of fair transition systems The integrity of complex dynamic systems often relies on the ability to detect", during operation, the occurrence of faults, or, in other words, to diagnose the system. The feasibility of this task, also known as diagnosability, depends on the nature of the system dynamics, the impact of faults, and the availability of a suitable set of sensors. Standard techniques for analyzing the diagnosability problem rely on a model of the system and on proving the absence of a faulty trace that cannot be distinguished by a non-faulty one (this pair of traces is called critical pair). In this paper, we tackle the problem of verifying diagnosability under the presence of fairness conditions. These extend the expressiveness of the system models enabling the specification of assumptions on the system behavior such as the infinite occurrence of observations and/or faults. We adopt a comprehensive framework that encompasses fair transition systems, temporally extended fault models, delays between the occurrence of a fault and its detection, and rich operational contexts. We show that in presence of fairness the definition of diagnosability has several interesting variants, and discuss the relative strengths and the mutual relationships. We prove that the existence of critical pairs is not always sufficient to analyze diagnosability, and needs to be generalized to critical sets. We define new notions of critical pairs, called ribbon-shape, with special looping conditions to represent the critical sets. Based on these findings, we provide algorithms to prove the diagnosability under fairness. The approach is built on top of the classical twin plant construction, and generalizes it to cover the various forms of diagnosability and find sufficient delays. The proposed algorithms are implemented within the XSAP platform for safety analysis," leveraging efficient symbolic model checking primitives. An experimental evaluation on a heterogeneous set of realistic benchmarks from various application domains demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.""""""",2-s2.0-85129048758

Abstract: ""Enhancing the Evaluation of Fault Detection Models in Smart Agriculture Using LLM Agents for Rule-Based Anomaly Generation In the context of Agriculture 4.0", advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and big data analytics play a critical role in enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of farming operations. These innovations enable real-time monitoring and decision-making, improving the efficiency, sustainability, and productivity of agricultural systems. Central to Agriculture 4.0 is the deployment of sensors embedded in agricultural machinery, such as tractors, which continuously collect data on key operational metrics, including engine performance, fuel consumption, soil conditions, and equipment health. The effective analysis of such data is essential for predictive maintenance, as early detection of potential anomalies can prevent costly breakdowns and reduce downtime. However, finding real-world datasets containing examples of anomalies in agricultural machinery is highly challenging, making it difficult to develop and assess the effectiveness of anomaly detection models. Additionally, classical methods for anomaly generation, such as stochastic and adversarial approaches, may be difficult to apply given the intricate patterns and time dependency of these data. To address this gap, our work leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic workflows to generate realistic anomaly scenarios from agricultural data. Using a rule-based approach that combines prompt engineering techniques with a multiagent system, we create synthetic anomalies that can later be used to evaluate anomaly detection models. These models would then enable the timely identification of potential machinery failures, reducing maintenance costs, minimizing downtime, and significantly lowering the environmental impact by preventing inefficiencies such as increased fuel consumption from faulty equipment, reducing the need for replacement parts," and conserving energy and resources used in repairs.""",2-s2.0-86000713671
