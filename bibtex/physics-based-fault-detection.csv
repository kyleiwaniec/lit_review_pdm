However, the commonly used chiller sequencing control strategy often deviates from expectations significantly due to common sensor measurement uncertainties encountered in practice. To address this problem, this study proposes a physics-guided chiller sequencing control strategy that improves the system's robustness and energy efficiency by adaptively adjusting chiller switching thresholds to accommodate sensor measurement uncertainties. First, a physics-guided fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) supervisor is developed to diagnose the fault types associated with each chiller-ON event under the corresponding switching thresholds. Subsequently, based on the identified fault type, a self-adaptive switching threshold supervisor is developed to adaptively adjust the chiller switching thresholds (i.e., key parameters for determining the chiller stages) for mitigating the adverse impacts resulting from the sensor measurement uncertainties. The test results show that the proposed control strategy can significantly enhance the robustness under negative measurement uncertainties and save the total system energy consumption by up to 7.46 % without sacrificing robustness under positive measurement uncertainties. © 2025","Chiller sequencing control; Energy efficiency; Fault detection and diagnosis; Measurement uncertainties; Robustness","Adaptive control systems; Cooling systems; Fault detection; Chiller sequencing control; Chiller system; Control strategies; Energy; Fault detection and diagnosis; Fault types; Measurement uncertainty; Robustness; Sensor measurements; Switching thresholds; detection method; energy efficiency; measurement method; sensor; uncertainty analysis; Robustness (control systems)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000454768"

Although existing models can accurately predict performance at both design-and off-design conditions, they often overlook part-load conditions. Besides, during full-load modeling, the mismatch between ideal operational data (with fully opened IGV) and actual operational data (with nearly fully opened IGV) may introduce additional modeling errors. Moreover, existing part-load performance prediction methods are typically implemented based on specific assumptions that only work under certain preconditions. To tackle these problems, a novel GT full-and part-load performance prediction model is proposed. First, the baseline model is established, serving as a solid foundation for subsequent correcting. Then, the IGV correction coefficients are calculated to quantify the baseline model's prediction bias caused by varying IGV positions. Subsequently, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) enhanced with residual connection and feature engineering techniques is developed to accurately predict the IGV correction coefficients. Due to the small amount of input variables and training samples, feature generation and feature analysis methods are adopted to improve the prediction accuracy. Moreover, the residual connection is incorporated to partially mitigate the gradient vanishing phenomenon. Finally, the trained model is integrated into the physics model to calculate the corrected performance. The actual data adopted from various operating conditions are utilized to verify its efficiency and accuracy. The average prediction error is less than 1.59 %, indicating that the proposed method can accurately predict GT performance under both full- and part-load conditions, thereby providing a solid foundation for fault diagnosis. © 2025","Gas turbine; Performance prediction; Physics-data driven","Electric load forecasting; Failure analysis; Gas engineering; Prediction models; Data driven; Feature engineerings; Full-load; Gas turbine performance; Part load conditions; Performance; Performance prediction; Performance prediction models; Physic-data driven; Physics data; accuracy assessment; correction; detection method; foundation; performance assessment; turbine; Fault detection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008504845"

This study proposes a comprehensive approach integrating full-band vibration analysis, including high-order harmonics, to enhance diagnostic precision. A theoretical model coupling magnetostriction and thermodynamics was developed, combined with empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and Pearson’s correlation coefficient for fault characterization. A 10 kV transformer core vibration test platform was constructed, capturing signals under normal, partially loose, and completely loose states. The simulation results aligned with the experimental data, showing vibration accelerations of 0.01 m/s2 (Phase A) and 0.023 m/s2 (Phase B). A multi-physics coupling model incorporating Young’s modulus variations simulated core loosening, revealing increased high-frequency components (up to 1000 Hz) and vibration amplitudes (0.2757 m/s2 for complete loosening). The joint EMD–Pearson method quantified fault severity, yielding correlation values of 0.0007 (normal), 0.0044 (partial loosening), and 0.0116 (complete loosening), demonstrating a clear positive correlation with fault progression. Experimental validation confirmed the model’s reliability, with the simulations matching the test results. This approach addresses the limitations of traditional methods by incorporating high-frequency analysis and multi-physics modeling, significantly improving early fault detection accuracy and providing a quantifiable diagnostic framework for transformer core health monitoring. © 2025 by the authors.","fault diagnosis; joint algorithm; loosening fault; transformer core; vibration waveform","Electric transformer testing; Machine vibrations; Magnetostriction; Natural frequencies; Detection accuracy; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Faults diagnosis; High frequency components; Higher-frequency components; Joint algorithms; Loosening fault; Simulation analysis; Transformer core; Vibration waveforms; Vibration analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218474165"

Data-driven methods are efficient in differentiating healthy conditions from faulty conditions by characterizing machine signals, involving stages of data acquisition, feature extraction, and condition determination. Traditionally, feature extraction and condition determination were manual, but advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, especially deep learning, have automated this process. Although deep learning can automatically learn features from input data, the signal domain can affects model performance. Time and frequency domain representations are widely used in fault detection methodologies using vibration signals. In contrast, angular and order domains are more common in variable operating conditions, but their direct use with deep learning remains rare in the literature. Considering this, this study evaluates a bearing fault detection methodology using vibration signals in different domains (time, frequency, angular, and order) under various rotational conditions. Three distinct approaches were tested to assess the effectiveness of these representations. Results showed the frequency domain had the best performance, and the study concluded that angular and order domains offer no significant advantage over it. Nonetheless, it is recommended to conduct a more in-depth analysis with more diverse datasets, especially those containing early-stage bearing fault signals. © 2024 Prognostics and Health Management Society.

However, they are susceptible to various malfunctions due to harsh working environments and complex transmission media, which can significantly impact production safety and efficiency. To address the challenge of obtaining fault data in actual operational settings, we constructed a fault test bench for pneumatic control valves and simulated a variety of fault conditions. We collected 421 fault data samples across four valve opening conditions, categorizing them into 27 distinct states with varying sample sizes, averaging 3-4 samples per state. To tackle the small-sample issue, we proposed a data augmentation method using periodic extension, validated through comparative analysis with other algorithms. Additionally, we innovatively analyze the data flow of pneumatic control valves and explore the relationships between different parameters. Based on these relationships, the input structure of the residual network is optimized. The above theoretical approach reduces the number of variables that need to be captured by the pneumatic control valve inspection system. Finally, through experiments under extreme conditions, our approach successfully diagnoses faults in 26 subclasses of pneumatic control valves, providing a reliable safeguard for industrial production safety and stability. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd.","fault diagnosis; hybrid physics deep learning; pneumatic control valve; small-sample","Accident prevention; Deep learning; Fault detection; Pneumatics; Safety valves; Control valves; Fault data; Faults diagnosis; Hybrid physic deep learning; Industrial processs; Industrial production; Pneumatic control valve; Process automation; Production safety; Small samples; Failure analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199682794"

Therefore, it is imperative to determine a real-time PD monitoring system, that can consider relevant sensor data which is continuously collected and analyzed. In this study, hall-effect sensors are chosen to detect changes in the magnetic flux, this signal is processed to detect and localize PD within a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM). Traditionally, methods for PD detection require invasive current sensors, or expensive optical sensors for accurate localization. In this study, we show that the use of hall effect sensors with advanced machine learning techniques can accurately detect and localize PD in a PMSM. The proposed framework combines time series modeling, machine learning for data generation, digital twin modeling, and ensemble learning for detection and localization of PD. This methodology is generalizable for discrete-time faults within various engineered systems. For our application, experimental data is very limited, so a finite element (FE) simulation model is implemented to create initial datasets. From this data, a time-series model is utilized to indicate the instance of PD. This model is able to detect PD within a certain range around the hall-effect sensor, and ultimately an optimal network of sensors can be determined. Next, features are determined based on physics and first principles, which are then inputted into the ensemble learning classifier for localization of PD within the PMSM. This technique is enhanced by a digital twin model, namely a simulation of the healthy motor running in parallel. The difference between the healthy magnetic flux and the PD magnetic flux enables the classifier to make accurate localization. Since this machine learning model requires an adequate amount of training data, a Gaussian Process Regression model is utilized as a surrogate model to generate the necessary data. PD diagnostics is a big challenge in recent literature, and our proposed method has shown effectiveness for not only detecting PD, but also localizing it. The first stage stacking classifier, which localizes the PD to the winding section, has 100% accuracy and a Brier score of 0.02. The second stage bagging classifier, which localizes with more precision within the winding, has an accuracy of 83%, with a Brier score of 0.21. This is a satisfactory performance for PD diagnostics in PMSMs, especially with a noninvasive hall effect sensor. In addition, the proposed framework has the potential to be a generic monitoring system for discrete-time faults in various new engineering applications, where there may exist very little data and information for analysis. © 2025","Digital twin; Ensemble learning; Fault detection; Hall effect sensor; Partial discharge; Permanent magnet synchronous motor","Deterioration; Digital twin; Electric motors; Electric windings; Gaussian distribution; Hall effect; Hall effect transducers; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Magnetic flux; Regression analysis; Time series; Winding; Dielectrics breakdown; Discrete time; Ensemble learning; Faults detection; Hall-effect sensors; Localisation; Localised; Partial discharge diagnosis; Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor; Times series models; Fault detection; Partial discharges","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010077459"

Bayesian filters can be used for prognostics as they can update physics-of-failure models, establishing a quantitative relation between asset usage and the remaining useful life. However, such filters require real-time direct condition measurements (e.g. crack length), while in many practical applications, only indirect condition measurements (e.g. vibrations), are available. A quantitative diagnostic algorithm that converts indirect into direct condition measurements is needed to create the required input for Bayesian filters. Such a diagnostic algorithm requires (labeled) degradation data, which are often unavailable for real-world applications. Therefore, simulation models can be helpful to generate synthetic degradation data. This paper proposes to use bond graphs for the generation of synthetic degradation data. Bond graphs are especially helpful due to their modularity and reusability. The creation of synthetic degradation data is demonstrated on a case study concerning outer race damage of a rolling-element bearing. An existing algorithm for fault size estimation is applied to the synthetic data generated by bond graphs. The fault size, derived by the quantitative diagnostics algorithm, is implemented in a prognostic framework based on a Bayesian filter. It is shown that the bond graph accurately creates synthetic failure data. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that existing diagnostic methods are insufficiently accurate to represent all damage shapes in bearings while bond graphs create vibration data for specific fault shapes. Therefore, bond graphs can improve quantitative diagnostics. © 2025 The Authors","Bearings; Bond graphs; Diagnostics; Particle filter; Predictive maintenance; Prognostics","Bayesian networks; Condition monitoring; Failure (mechanical); Fault detection; Graph algorithms; Graphic methods; Outages; Predictive maintenance; Reusability; Signal filtering and prediction; Bayesian filters; Bearing; Bond graph; Condition; Degradation data; Diagnostic; Diagnostic algorithms; Particle filter; Predictive maintenance; Prognostic; Plasma diagnostics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011201077"

To address these challenges, this study introduces an online incremental learning approach based on a novel algorithm, the dynamic random forests in queue structure (DRFQS). This algorithm incorporates a universally applicable dataset shift detection method and clear stability-plasticity balance control. By integrating COP DRFQS predictors with mechanism models, heat pump and chiller models with self-evolution capabilities were developed. Simulation results including over 100 COP drop fault scenarios demonstrate that the self-evolution models outperform non-evolvable models trained via offline batch learning. The self-evolution models autonomously adapt to new time-varying and condition-dependent patterns in thermodynamic performance without interruptions, effectively overcoming dataset shift issues during long-term use. The models significantly enhance prediction accuracy for COP, thermodynamic perfection, and other parameters with prediction errors decreased by 37.1 %∼84.6 %.

MT-GPL models an optical network and the optical performance monitoring data collected in it as graph-structured data and makes use of graph neural networks to learn graph embeddings that capture both topological correlations (for fault localization) and fault discriminative patterns (for root cause analysis). MT-GPL interprets its reasoning by (i) introducing a prototype layer that learns physics-aligned prototypes indicative of each fault class using the Monte Carlo tree search method and (ii) performing predictions based on the similarities between the embedding of an input graph and the learned prototypes. To enhance the scalability and interpretability of MT-GPL, we develop a multi-task architecture that performs concurrent fault localization and reasoning with node-level and device-level prototype learning and fault predictions.

In this regard, their reliability, and health optimal performance are in the first priority. However, as the number of switches in a multilevel inverter increases, it comes so common to occur faults within the system. Ensuring the reliability of MLI is an important concern in power industries, making effective fault detection methods essential. Developing precise physics-based, model-based, and hardware-based models for fault detection is challenging, largely due to unknown parameters and incomplete understanding of the physical processes within the system. At this end, the proposed paper presents a highly efficient hyper-tuned machine learning (ML) model known as Isolation Forest (IF). This algorithm is an unsupervised method used for anomaly detection, which isolates outliers by recursively partitioning data points, as an effective way for identifying faults or rare events in large datasets with minimal computational complexity of the MLI system. To test this algorithm, a 17-level Cascaded H-Bridge (CHB) inverter is simulated with several faults, the proposed IF model is tested. In the next phase, the proposed model compared to the others, based on the performance indicators of F1-Score, Precision, Recall, and Accuracy, which the highest results retained for IF to have an accurate unsupervised fault detection model, that smoothens the way for a fully automated, and self-healing industrial application system. © The Author(s) 2025.","Artificial intelligence; Fault detection; Multi-level CHB inverters; Unsupervised learning","algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; electric potential; forest; human; learning; machine learning; outlier detection; reliability; simulation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004194573"

Traditional approaches with such systems of systems focus on reliability, robustness, and redundancy. These approaches seek to avoid failure rather than reduce overall risk. However, faults are inevitable, and understanding and managing the complex and emergent behavior and cascading events of such a complex system is critical. This study describes the development of HabSim, a computational simulation environment intended to support research to establish the know-how to design and operate resilient and autonomous SmartHabs. HabSim is a modular virtual testbed composed of many of the coupled dynamic systems expected in a typical SmartHab. A heterogeneous set of interconnected physics-based and phenomenological models is used to represent the essential functions of a SmartHab. HabSim further considers disruptions and models damage and repair of certain components. This paper discusses a) system and subsystem requirements of the deep space habitat included in the HabSim platform; b) architectural choices made in response to the requirements; c) technical considerations for developing, verifying, configuring, and executing HabSim; and d) illustrative sample results from a simulation of a representative disruption scenario. © 2024 by the authors.","Application Programming Interface; Computational Simulation; Deep Space Habitat; Environmental Control and Life Support System; Fault Detection and Diagnosis; Future Space Technologies; Lunar Environment; Planets; System Architectures; System Health Management","C (programming language); Space research; Structural dynamics; Tropics; Virtual environments; Applications programming interfaces; Computational simulation; Deep space; Deep space habitat; Environmental control and life support system; Fault detection and diagnosis; Future space technology; Lunar environment; Space habitat; Space technologies; Systems architecture; Systems health management; Testbeds","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85219752249"

However, individual energy monitoring tools, such as energy meters or cost allocators, are not always affordable or technically feasible to install. Therefore, the development of virtual tools that enable the study of energy consumption in existing buildings is necessary. Virtual sensors, particularly based on white-box models, offer the opportunity to recreate these behaviours. When calibrated with measured data, white-box models, which incorporate detailed building physics, become increasingly valuable for designing energy-efficient buildings. This research explores a novel approach to identifying building’s load period directly from energy data generated by these calibrated models. The volume of data generated by white-box models can be overwhelming for visual analysis, but the hypothesis here is that analysing this data through clustering techniques can reveal patterns related to occupant behaviour and operational schedules. By feeding indoor temperature data into the calibrated model and analysing the resulting energy outputs, the research proposes a method to identify the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system operation schedule, free oscillation periods and non-recurrent events. Validation is achieved by comparing the identified periods with actual measured data. This methodology enables the development of a virtual sensor for cost allocation, which minimises the need for physical sensor deployment while complying with European Union directives. The research not only demonstrates high accuracy but also the potential to outperform measured schedule. This suggests the ability of the method to identify missing sensor data or other factors affecting temperature curves, enabling fault detection and diagnostics (FDD). Consequently, this opens doors for setting optimised operation schedules that balance energy efficiency with occupant comfort. © The Author(s) 2024.","calibrated models; cluster; free oscillation; load; schedule; white-box","HVAC; Indoor air pollution; Network security; Calibrated model; Cluster; Clusterings; Energy-consumption; Free oscillation; Load; Schedule; Virtual sensor; White box; White-box models; Fault detection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212291050"

However, the complex multi-physical interactions within HFTs, including electromagnetic, thermal, and mechanical couplings, make them highly susceptible to various fault conditions, such as harmonic distortions and DC biasing. In this paper, a fault diagnosis method leveraging multi-physics field coupling and feature learning-based image analysis is proposed. The deformation and thermal stress fields under different operating conditions - including no-load, harmonic excitation, and DC bias - are simulated and captured through high-frequency image data. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is employed to automatically extract hierarchical features from the temperature and stress distributions, while a complementary bag-of-visual-words (BoVW) approach further enhances feature representation. The proposed method integrates data augmentation techniques tailored for multi-modal inputs, improving the generalization capability of the model under high-noise and small-sample scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the developed approach achieves a fault classification accuracy exceeding 97%, significantly outperforming traditional single-modal diagnostic methods. The model's ability to differentiate subtle fault patterns and handle overlapping feature distributions is validated, highlighting its robustness in diverse and noisy environments. © 2025 IEEE.","convolutional neural network; fault diagnosis method; feature learning; high frequency transformer; multi-physics field","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Electric fault currents; Electric power distribution; Fault detection; High frequency transformers; Industrial electronics; Learning systems; Modal analysis; Robotics; Stresses; Convolutional neural network; Fault diagnosis method; Feature learning; Field coupling; High-frequency transformers; Multi-physic field; Multi-physical fields; Multi-physics; Renewable energies; Transformer fault diagnosis; Failure analysis","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010826495"

Because of objective factors such as invisible area, low-loss circuit structure design, and frequency insensitivity, traditional algorithms based on visual and temperature features are limited in practice; therefore, the algorithm based on electromagnetic features containing rich physical connotations and prominent frequency features has received attention in PCB fault diagnosis. Based on the basic principles of electromagnetic physics and PCB fault relationship, this article proposes a scalar magnetic field source feature and further improves feature performance by adding topological relationships of multifaults to generate the fusion feature. The backbone of the PCB diagnosis model is established on the Transformer architecture, effectively using self-attention and parallel computing mechanisms to explore the inner correlation between each group feature.

Integrating the physical information related to bearing degradation into the optimization based HI construction process in a nonlinear form, has yet to be fully explored. To solve this problem, this study first proposes a novel nonlinear optimization-based weight learning model for constructing a HI. By introducing kernel methods, the model maximizes the correlation between the latest measured time series and previously measured time series while simultaneously minimizing the fitting error, effectively capturing the nonlinear relations between spectral components. We also explore how the bearing degradation-related physics information can be fully revealed from the built HIs and how this information can be used to explain the superior performance of the HIs in terms of diagnosis and prognosis. Moreover, the constructed HIs are utilized for remaining useful life (RUL) prediction based on a stochastic degradation modelling approach.

As PMSMs play an important role in electric vehicles, renewable energy systems and aerospace applications, ensuring their reliability is more important than ever. This work examines widely applied methods like Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA) and flux monitoring, alongside more recent approaches such as time-frequency analysis, observer-based techniques and machine learning strategies. These methods are discussed in terms of strengths/weaknesses, challenges and suitability for different operating conditions. The review also highlights the importance of experimental validations to connect theoretical research with real-world applications. By exploring potential synergies between these diagnostic methods, the paper outlines ways to improve fault detection accuracy and machine reliability. It concludes by identifying future research directions, such as developing real-time diagnostics, enhancing predictive maintenance and refining sensor and computational technologies, aiming to make PMSMs more robust and fault-tolerant in demanding environments. In addition, the discussion highlights how partial demagnetization or ITSC faults may propagate if not diagnosed promptly, necessitating scalable and efficient multi-physics approaches.

However, industrial applications often face significant challenges, including the scarcity of labeled samples and the presence of noise interference. To address these challenges, the study presents a semi-supervised bearing fault diagnosis method based on an improved Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (IWGAN). Initially, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is applied to denoise the signals and extract key features. Subsequently, a limited number of labeled samples along with a large quantity of unlabeled samples are fed into the IWGAN. The study employs a hybrid module consisting of CNN and Transformer as the foundation for the generator (G). In the architecture, the model incorporates convolutional operations to simultaneously leverage attention-based global feature capture and the local feature extraction capabilities of CNN, effectively capturing both local and global features. The discriminator (D) incorporates a dynamic sparse attention mechanism (DSAM), which adaptively enhances the key features while suppressing redundant information. By integrating semi-supervised learning strategies with a novel loss function, the proposed method achieves a synergy between supervised and unsupervised learning paradigms. Experimental validation on two representative bearing fault datasets demonstrates that the proposed approach achieves superior diagnostic accuracy and robustness against noise, even under conditions of substantial noise interference and limited labeled samples. The study introduces a novel and scalable diagnostic framework, providing an effective solution to the challenges of industrial fault diagnosis in real-world scenarios. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.","Bearing fault diagnosis; Continuous wavelet transform; Transformer; Wasserstein generative adversarial network","Bearings (machine parts); Electric fault currents; Fault detection; Labeled data; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Semi-supervised learning; Signal processing; Unsupervised learning; Wavelet transforms; Adversarial networks; Bearing fault diagnosis; Continuous Wavelet Transform; Faults diagnosis; Global feature; Key feature; Noise interference; Semi-supervised; Transformer; Wasserstein generative adversarial network; Article; computer analysis; continuous wavelet transform; convolutional neural network; data accuracy; deep adaptive graph convolutional network; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; environmental noise; fault diagnosis; fault tree analysis; feature extraction; full weight bearing; Gaussian noise; generative adversarial network; machine learning; mathematical analysis; mathematical model; multilayer perceptron; non optimizing generative adversarial network; nonhuman; observational study; physics-informed subdomain moment enhanced adaptation network; reliability; signal noise ratio; sparse dense matrix multiplication; synergistic effect; temporal analysis; training; Failure analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008936451"

The use of CACC technologies increases safety and the traffic throughput, and decreases fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. However, CAVs heavily rely on embedded software, hardware, and communication networks that make them vulnerable to a range of cyberattacks. Cyberattacks to a particular CAV compromise the entire platoon as CACC schemes propagate corrupted data to neighboring vehicles potentially leading to traffic delays and collisions. Physics-based monitors can be used to detect the presence of false data injection (FDI) attacks to CAV sensors; however, given enough system knowledge, adversaries are still able to launch a range of attacks that can surpass the detection scheme by hiding within the system disturbances and uncertainty - we refer to this class of attacks as stealthy FDI attacks. Stealthy attacks are hard to deal with as they affect the platoon dynamics without being noticed. In this manuscript, we propose a design methodology (built around a series convex programs) to synthesize distributed attack monitors and H∞ CACC controllers that minimize the joint effect of stealthy FDI attacks and system disturbances on the platoon dynamics while guaranteeing a prescribed platooning performance.

The term “light commercial building” typically refers to commercial buildings that have a surface area of less than 2350 square meters and no more than six stories. These buildings typically rely on relatively simpler HVAC systems that have similar configurations, which facilitates the development of scalable and replicable fault detection approaches. This paper introduces three inverse modeling approaches to establish a baseline for detecting anomalies in Air Handling Unit (AHU) systems within these light commercial buildings. The study aims to characterize AHU thermal loads using optimization techniques: artificial neural networks (ANNs), genetic algorithms (GA), and Physics-based neural networks (PBNN). Anomalies in energy consumption are then identified as deviations from this baseline. AHU data from a light commercial building in Montreal, Canada, is employed for validation. Results indicate superior performance of PBNN in baseline establishment compared to optimization methods. Detected anomalies using PBNN can aid in investigating programming logic faults following ASHRAE Guideline 36. The study underscores the importance of robust anomaly detection methods in enhancing the operational efficiency of AHU systems, particularly in light commercial buildings. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.","Air Handling Unit; Anomaly Detection; Inverse Model; Physics-Based Neural Network","Climate control; Inverse problems; Inverse transforms; Air-handling unit; Anomaly detection; Commercial building; Fault detection and diagnosis; Inverse modelling; Neural-networks; Physic-based neural network; Physics-based; Substantial energy; Unit systems; Office buildings","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213010645"

Faulty electromechanical equipment often produces unrecognizable electrical signatures that confound data-driven techniques. Fault signatures are typically unknown during training. For some loads, analytical models and simulation can predict fault signatures, facilitating their inclusion in the training set. However, this approach scales unfavorably with the number of parameters associated with faults. An alternate outlook recognizes that faults often change the power system conditions and the quality of power delivered. Assumptions about the character and quality of the local grid should be called into question during faulty load behavior. The objectives of this work are to correlate these changing grid behaviors with load and fault signatures as a step towards automatic fault detection. Our methodology involves creating supplemental “derived” data streams distilled from nonintrusive electrical measurements that can correlate changes in grid conditions and quality with load operation. Using real fault data from shipboard microgrids, our key findings illustrate that combining these derived streams with nonintrusive power data enables both nonintrusive load identification and fault diagnosis. Finally, this work presents a vision for implementing an integration of these streams with physics-based fault models in an automatic fault detection system. © 2013 IEEE.","Fault detection; nonintrusive load monitoring; power quality; smart metering","Electromechanical devices; Automatic fault detection; Condition based maintenance; Electrical monitoring; Fault conditions; Fault signature; Faults detection; Non-intrusive; Nonintrusive load monitoring; Power; Smart metering; Power distribution faults","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003827033"

However, in recent years, the problem of buffer layer erosion in corrugated aluminum sheath cables has become more prevalent, affecting the safety of equipment and systems. This article provides a comprehensive review of cable structure, buffer layer failure mechanisms, and buffer layer failure detection methods, aiming to provide references for research on buffer layer erosion issues in high-voltage cables, development of detection technologies, and formulation of efficient operation and maintenance strategies. Based on the analysis of the three-dimensional structure, development history, equivalent circuit principles, and key electrical parameters of cable buffer layers, this paper systematically analyzes three types of erosion mechanisms: chemical/electrochemical corrosion, suspended potential, and radial current concentration. It summarizes the reaction or action mechanisms of chemical/electrochemical corrosion, and the white powder formed after corrosion mainly consists of sodium polyacrylate, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, aluminum hydroxide, and aluminum oxide. The white powder on the surface of the insulation shielding layer mainly includes sodium polyacrylate precipitated by moisture and sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate precipitated by chemical reactions inside the buffer layer; the white powder on the surface between the buffer layer and the corrugated aluminum sheath includes sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate precipitated by chemical reactions inside the buffer layer, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, aluminum hydroxide, and aluminum oxide generated by chemical corrosion of the aluminum sheath, and aluminum hydroxide and aluminum oxide generated by electrochemical corrosion. Meanwhile, circuit models or multi-physics field simulation models are established to summarize the forms of suspended potential and radial current concentration faults and key influencing factors. It is found that increasing the thickness of the buffer layer can reduce the maximum surface electric field strength at the defect to a certain extent, but the difference is not by an order of magnitude, so the improvement effect is limited. However, the gap distance between the aluminum sheath and the buffer layer has a significant impact on the maximum surface electric field strength at the defect. When the gap distance increases from 0 to 1 mm, the maximum electric field strength decreases by 62%, indicating that adjusting the physical coordination between the aluminum sheath and the buffer layer is the key to improving the distribution of the electric field between the buffer layers. In addition, compared with the condition of radial current concentration erosion of the buffer layer combined with moisture and radial current concentration, the temperature rise of the buffer layer and the peak intensity of the heat source increase significantly, and the length of poor axial contact of the cable is shortened by nearly 58%. Finally, the feasibility and existing problems of three types of methods, namely X-ray detection, partial discharge detection, and characteristic gas detection, in buffer layer failure detection are discussed. It is found that the defect detection technology based on characteristic gas recognition has advantages such as high accuracy, nondestructive testing, and short detection time. It has great potential in diagnosing buffer layer erosion defects in cables, but it still needs to develop technologies suitable for on-site applications. The following conclusions can be drawn from simulation analysis and systematic review: (1) Water is the premise for the formation of white powder in the buffer layer, so preventing cables from getting wet is the key to avoiding chemical/electrochemical corrosion of the buffer layer. (2) Reasonable adjustment of the physical coordination between the aluminum sheath and the buffer layer is the key to improving the distribution of the electric field between the buffer layers. (3) The combination of buffer layer white powder and radial current concentration erosion conditions is more in line with actual engineering applications. Subsequent research on thermal erosion theory related to buffer layers should focus on the influence of white powder on the electrical characteristic parameters of the buffer layer. (4) The buffer layer defect detection technology based on characteristic gas recognition has broad development prospects. Subsequent research should focus on developing new types of inflatable cables with strong gas detection capabilities and accelerating the exploration and development of on-site portable devices for buffer layer erosion gas generation mechanisms, gas sampling, and gas detection. © 2025 China Machine Press.

However, the weak fault characteristics present during the early stages of fault initiation are often obscured by noise, posing significant challenges for machine health monitoring, particularly for incipient fault detection and diagnosis. To address this problem, this study proposes an interpretable time–frequency weight optimization methodology based on convex representation. First, compact convex hulls are employed to geometrically represent time–frequency spectrograms at different health conditions. A nearest-point convex hull optimization model is then introduced to implicitly learn interpretable weight matrix, enabling the identification of informative frequency bands within the time–frequency domain. Theoretical exploration of the optimized weight matrix reveals their geometric meanings and their correlation with fault characteristics in the time–frequency domain. Additionally, a condition indicator is constructed using information fusion, facilitating rapid detection of incipient faults. Simulated and experimental results validate the proposed method, demonstrating that the learned time–frequency weights are physics-informed and capable of identifying critical frequency bands for fault diagnostics in agreement with theoretical exploration. With explicit physical interpretability, the proposed methodology surpasses current approaches in its effectiveness for incipient fault detection and diagnosis. This study is the first to establish a theoretical framework for interpreting the physical meanings of the optimized weight matrix in the time–frequency domain by employing convex hull representation in the context of machine health monitoring. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Convex hulls; Machine health monitoring; Optimized weight matrix; Physics-informed; Theoretical exploration; Time-frequency spectrograms","Convex optimization; Diagnosis; Fault detection; Geometry; Matrix algebra; Spectrographs; Wavelet transforms; Convex hull; Machine health monitoring; Optimized weight matrix; Physic-informed; Theoretical exploration; Time frequency; Time frequency domain; Time-frequency spectrogram; Weight matrices; Weight optimization; Frequency domain analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000862562"

This paper presents an innovative hybrid modelling approach applied to DC electric motors, specifically the Kollmorgen AKM42 servomotor. The proposed Cooperative Hybrid Model for Classification (CHMC) combines physics-based and data-driven models to improve fault detection and extrapolation to new usage profiles. The integration of physical knowledge of the healthy behaviour of the motor into a recurrent neural network enhances the accuracy of bearing fault detection by identifying three health states: healthy, progressive fault and stabilised fault. Additionally, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is employed for the purposes of feature extraction and dimensionality reduction, thereby enhancing the model’s capacity to generalise with limited training data. The findings of this study demonstrate that a reduction in the input data of 90% preserves the essential information, with an analysis of the first harmonics revealing a narrow frequency range. This elucidates the reason why the first 20 components are sufficient to explain the data variability. The findings reveal that, for usage profiles analogous to the training data, both the CHMC and NHMC models demonstrate comparable performance without reduction. However, the CHMC model exhibits superior performance in detecting true negatives (90% vs. 89%) and differentiating between healthy and failure states. The NHMC model encounters greater difficulty in distinguishing failure states (83.92% vs. 86.56% for progressive failure). When exposed to new usage profiles with increased frequency and amplitude, the CHMC model adapts better, showing superior performance in detecting true positives and handling new data, highlighting its superior extrapolation capabilities. The integration of SVD further reduces input data complexity, and the CHMC model consistently outperforms the NHMC model in these reduced data scenarios, demonstrating the efficacy of combining physical models and dimensionality reduction in enhancing the model’s generalisation, fault detection, and adaptability. This approach has the advantage of reducing the need for retraining, which makes the CHMC model a cost-effective solution for motor fault classification in industrial settings. In conclusion, the CHMC model offers a generalisable method with significant advantages in fault detection, model adaptation, and predictive maintenance performance across varying usage profiles and on unseen operational scenarios. © 2025 by the authors.","classification; dimensionality reduction; direct current motor; failure monitoring; hybrid modelling; long short-term memory","AC motors; DC motors; Failure analysis; Input output programs; Long short-term memory; Network security; Outages; Steganography; Classification models; Dimensionality reduction; Direct current motors; Failure monitoring; Faults detection; Hybrid model; Industrial systems; Model reduction; Performance; Short term memory; article; classification; controlled study; diagnosis; dimensionality reduction; direct current; electric engine; feature extraction; health status; human; hybrid; long short term memory network; physical model; recurrent neural network; reliability; singular value decomposition; Extrapolation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001129624"

To this end, we proposed a hierarchical physics-informed neural network (HPINN) to identify/discover the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of a healthy/faulty rotor system from noise measurements and then assess the rotor condition based on the discovered ODEs. Specifically, the ODEs of a healthy rotor system are first stably identified from noisy measurement through HPINN guided by rotor dynamics. Based on the identified healthy ODEs, the extra fault terms in the ODEs of the faulty rotor system are then sparsely regressed from the predefined library embedded in HPINN, in which the phase compensation and alternating training strategy are developed to guarantee training convergence. Moreover, with the mathematical terms of discovered fault, the potential fault and the health indicator (HI) are diagnosed and constructed to assess the condition of the rotor system, respectively. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified with simulation and test bench datasets, showing the potential for practical industrial applications. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","fault diagnosis; health indicator; physics-informed neural network; Rotor system","Diagnosis; Fault detection; Rotors; Condition; Coupled nonlinearities; Faults diagnosis; Health assessments; Health indicators; Large rotating machinery; Measurement Noise; Neural-networks; Physic-informed neural network; Rotor systems; Rotating machinery","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003170925"

By incorporating the physics-based model in the fault diagnosis algorithm, we can access to several process variables not directly measured through sensors but related to the state of the PEMFC stack. The model estimates are subsequently combined with signals measured on the PEMFC stack and inputted to a LSTM neural network. The performance of the physics-guided LSTM is evaluated on an extensive dataset comprising a thousand hours of operation of a PEMFC stack under dynamic load profiles, proving the enhanced capability of the proposed fault diagnosis method in capturing complex fault patterns. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed method in dealing with PEMFC aging is tested by using data from the initial phase of stack operation for algorithm training and reserving the data from the aged stack operation for the testing phase.

The seismogenie structure of the three earthquakes is the Huya Fault. The Huya Fault is still a strong active fault, and there is still a possibility of major future earthquakes in the Songpan and Pingwu regions. Historical earthquake records only represent earthquakes that have occurred, and there is uneertainty in estimating earthquake motion using existing records, espeeially in near-fault areas without strong earthquake reeords. Estimating near-fault ground motion has become a researeh hotspot in the interdisciplinary field of seismology and engineering seismology in recent years. The researeh and methods differ from the design of earthquake motion methods for earthquake safety evaluation in engineering. They are developed by integrating earthquake source physics, seismic wave propagation theory, and engineering seismology. Based on the geological and geomorphological characteristics of the Songpan-Pingwu area in Sichuan Provinee and the process framework for construeting scenario earthquake models, we have developed three scenario earthquake source models with a magnitude of Mw7. 0. These models include rupture models and source mechanisms related to the Huya Fault. The seismic source parameters were referenced from existing Statistical models. Utilizing the three-dimensional finite difference method, we can simulate the long-term ground motion of scenario earthquakes for its facile discretization and computational efficiency. We set Virtual Observation stations within the calculated area, enabling the acquisition of velocity wave fields and waveforms across diverse earthquake scenarios. Besides, the velocity pulse identification method is combined to identify the seismic motion of the Virtual Station to study the distribution characteristics of regional velocity pulses. We use the pulse recognition method to identify velocity pulses of earthquake motion (observed or simulated earthquake motion). It can be summarized as a continuous wavelet transform of two orthogonal components of earthquake motion to determine whether it is a pulse. When the pulse index PI>0, the original record is determined to be a pulse, and the larger the PI, the stronger the pulse characteristics of the original record. When the pulse index PI<0, the original record is deemed nonpulse. This method can obtain the pulse amplitude and pulse period. Finally, the obtained results will be fitted with the probability distribution curve of velocity pulses to explore the impact of rupture mode and source meohanism on the distribution of velocity pulses. The results of this artiole indicate that; 1) The rupture mode is signifieant to the distribution of regional velocity pulses. For strike-slip faults, the velocity pulses caused by unilateral rupture mode are mainly in the E-W direction, and the peak value of the pulses does not exceed 50cm/s. The ränge of pulse distribution and the peak intensity of strong vibrations generated on the surface are smaller than the bilateral rupture mode. Strong velocity pulses not only appear near the projection area of faults on the surface but also trigger velocity pulses at a distance from the epicenter due to the directional effect of rupture. 2) The shape of the velocity pulse probability distribution curve is similar to the simulated velocity pulse distribution characteristics, and there are signifieant differences in the distribution of seismic motions under different source mechanisms. The current velocity pulse probability distribution model only considers the rupture characteristics and the relative position relationship between stations and faults without considering the influence of source parameters such as rupture velocity. There are deviations in the fitting effect for different components, such as E-W and N-S. The speed pulse period identified by Virtual stations varies from l-7s. By adding structural measures to the building strueture, the natural Vibration period of the strueture can be changed, thereby avoiding the potential hazards of pulse-type seismic motion. More actual Observation data is needed to study the distribution of velocity pulse periods in the future. This article's Simulation results are consistent with the existing understanding of earthquake motion. However, our study employs a simplified crustal strueture characterized by horizontal layers, temporarily ignoring the site condition in the Simulation of long-period ground motion. We do not encapsulate the complexities introduced by the site conditions. Average shear wave velocity at 30m Underground (Fs30) is a factor that affects the number of pulse recognition. In addition, this article does not discuss the effects of rupture speed, the number of asperities, and the position of asperities. Therefore, we will conduet more in-depth research on these factors in our subsequent work. The research in this article calculates the scenario earthquake of the Huya Fault under rupture mode and focal mechanism. The research results can be used for seismic analysis of long-period struetures, providing a reference for the construetion of signifieant projeets and seismic hazard analysis near the Huya Fault. This article referred to previous research when setting parameters for scenario earthquakes. However, due to the limitations of Statistical models, the set scenario earthquakes cannot fully represent the Huya Fault Situation and the region's possible earthquake scenarios. © 2024 State Seismology Administration.

In particular, under extreme conditions, the number of sensors is often severely limited, resulting in extremely sparse sensor data. This scarcity renders it challenging to obtain interpretable high-dimensional physical information in real-time. Many methods for condition monitoring predominantly rely on sensor data analysis, such as nonlinear fitting, which often lack physical interpretability. Hyper projection-based reduced order models (HPROMs) incorporating the physics, provide strong physical interpretability and high dimensional physical field real-time computing capability. However, HPROMs strictly adhere to forward calculation procedures because of approximation process of intrusive operators. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel physics-sensing framework (PSF) driven by a non-intrusive, inverse, hyper projection-based reduced order model (NII-HPROM) with extremely sparse sensor data. The NII-HPROM circumvents the approximation process of intrusive operators, enabling direct inverse computation of physical fields at hyper-reduced speeds.

This research introduces a novel approach to causal discovery and FDD using Variational Graph Autoencoders (VGAEs) enhanced with physics-informed constraints and conformal learning. Our method addresses limitations in conventional techniques, such as Granger causality, which struggle with high-dimensional, nonlinear systems. By integrating Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and an entropy-based dynamic edge sampling method, the framework focuses on high-uncertainty regions of the causal graph. Conformal learning establishes rigorous thresholds for causal inference. Validated through simulation and case studies, including an Australian refinery and the Tennessee Eastman Process, our approach improves causal discovery accuracy, reduces spurious connections, and enhances fault classification. Integrating domain-specific physics information also led to faster convergence and reduced computational demands.

Developing a diagnostic system with desirable fault isolability requires an accurate model and/or representative training data covering all possible faults. One promising approach involves using physics-based neural network residuals, known as grey-box models. These networks, designed to represent the system's nominal behavior and trained on fault-free data, are particularly advantageous when training data from faults are scarce. By incorporating causal relationships derived from physical insight, grey-box models retain the structural fault sensitivity of model-based residuals, enabling consistency-based diagnosis decision logic. However, despite their high accuracy in supervised learning benchmarks, neural networks often struggle with misclassification due to out of distribution data, a significant concern in diagnostic applications where false alarms are costly. This study highlights the importance of uncertainty quantification in neural network-based regression models and examines the interplay between different types of uncertainty in diagnostics. To address both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties and achieve desirable fault isolation, the study applies adaptive thresholds and a measure for testing the validity of the residuals. Additionally, it proposes a consistency-based diagnosis framework using data-driven residuals, with its effectiveness demonstrated on an aftertreatment system of a heavy-duty truck under various drive cycles and fault scenarios. © 2025","AI methods for FDI; Control and diagnosis of automotive systems; Filtering and change detection; Methods based on neural networks for FDI; Structural analysis and residual evaluation methods","AI method for FDI; Automotive Systems; Change detection; Control and diagnose of automotive system; Data driven; Evaluation methods; Filtering and change detection; Method based on neural network for FDI; Neural-networks; Structural analyze and residual evaluation method; Benchmarking","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85219010030"

However, existing solutions are affected by many different types of problems, such as managing heterogeneous and huge-scale data from dispersed industrial sensors, realising real-time analysis in high-speed data streams, and, at the same time, preserving interpretability while employing advanced techniques like deep learning and distributed machine learning. The recent approaches also use deep neural networks for fault detection and anomaly-based models for early warning signal identification with federated learning to ensure privacy-preserving data sharing.

To this end, one integrates machine-learning models with physics-based models across diverse datasets to enhance prediction accuracy while reducing false alarms and thus enabling proactive maintenance scheduling. In so doing, this approach will aim at shattering the present system's weaknesses by delivering robust anomaly detection along with decreased operational expenses in a scalable manner, thereby playing an important role towards further smarter, self-configurable manufacturing within the Industry 4.0 movement.  © 2025 IEEE.","Applied mathematics; Big data analytics; Industrial automation; Machine learning; Predictive maintenance","Anomaly detection; Data privacy; Data Sharing; Deep neural networks; Federated learning; Predictive analytics; Applied mathematics; Big data analytic; Data analytics; Industrial automation; Industrial automation system; Industrial sensor; Machine-learning; Potential benefits; Predictive maintenance; Production efficiency; Predictive maintenance","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002434453"

However, existing WTGCM methods based on SCADA overlook the fundamental thermal physics and sensor failure. To effectively address the challenges of weak feature generalization and numerous false alarms, we propose a highly robust WTGCM method based on energy flow. Firstly, based on the principles of thermal balance and wind energy conversion, a feature extraction method considering the physical change process of oil temperature is proposed. Secondly, the performance of different feature extraction methods is quantitatively analyzed using data evaluation criteria. The reasons why different feature extraction methods have different effects are revealed through dimensionality reduction analysis. Finally, we compare the proposed method with other feature extraction methods using four models to validate the excellent performance of the proposed method in the early fault warning. The results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces the average root mean square error by 18.21% during the healthy operation of the wind turbine gearboxes. Moreover, the proposed method performs excellently in early warning of mechanical and sensor faults, significantly reducing the number of false alarms.

Machine learning-based diagnostic models offer powerful solutions, but their effectiveness is challenged by substantial domain shifts caused by variations in operating conditions, such as changes in motor load. To address this challenge, a novel domain adaptation framework that combines physical domain knowledge with deep learning techniques is proposed. The framework employs envelope spectrum analysis to generate reliable pseudo-labels for unlabeled target domains. By incorporating local maximum mean discrepancy into the training process, the framework aligns feature distributions between source and target domains while preserving class-specific information. This method enhances the adaptability of diagnostic models to real-world industrial conditions, reducing the need for extensive labeled data and improving predictive reliability across different operating scenarios. Experimental results performed on the Case Western Reserve University bearing dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline models, achieving superior classification accuracy under significant domain shifts. By improving fault detection under varying load conditions, this approach contributes to more efficient predictive maintenance, reducing unexpected failures and operational downtime in industrial machinery.

While traditional empirical and physics-based models offer approximate predictions of power generation based on wind speed, they often fail to capture the complex, non-linear relationships between other input variables and the resulting power output. Data-driven machine learning methods present a promising avenue for improving wind turbine modeling by leveraging large datasets, enhancing prediction accuracy but often at the cost of interpretability. In this study, we propose a hybrid semi-parametric model that combines the strengths of both approaches, applied to a dataset from a wind farm with four turbines. The model integrates a physics-inspired submodel, providing a reasonable approximation of power generation, with a non-parametric submodel that predicts the residuals. This non-parametric submodel is trained on a broader range of variables to account for phenomena not captured by the physics-based component. The hybrid model achieves a 37% improvement in prediction accuracy over the physics-based model and performs comparably to a purely data-driven reference model, while offering additional advantages in terms of explainability and robustness. To further enhance interpretability, SHAP values are used to analyze the influence of input features on the residual submodel's output. Additionally, prediction uncertainties are quantified using a conformalized quantile regression method. The combination of these techniques, alongside the physics grounding of the parametric submodel, provides a flexible, accurate, and reliable framework. Ultimately, this study opens the door for evaluating the impact of unmodeled phenomena on wind turbine power generation, offering a basis for potential optimization. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.","Explainability; Hybrid models; Uncertainty quantification; Wind turbines","Data accuracy; Forecasting; Large datasets; Learning systems; Prediction models; Regression analysis; Turbogenerators; Uncertainty analysis; Wind effects; Wind power; Data driven; Explainability; Hybrid model; Interpretability; Physics-based models; Power- generations; Prediction accuracy; Submodels; Uncertainty quantifications; Wind turbine power; Wind turbines","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010938796"

Despite BD's appealing feature in adaptability and mathematical interpretability, a significant challenge persists: How to effectively integrate BD with fault-diagnosing classifiers? This issue is intricate to be tackled because the traditional BD method is solely designed for feature extraction with its own optimizer and objective function. When BD is combined with the downstream deep learning classifier, the different learning objectives easily get in conflict. To address this problem, this paper introduces classifier-guided BD (ClassBD) for joint learning of BD-based feature extraction and deep learning-based fault diagnosis. Towards this goal, we first develop a time and frequency neural BD that employs neural networks to implement conventional BD, thereby facilitating seamless integration of BD and the deep learning classifier for co-optimization of model parameters. In the neural BD, we incorporate two filters: (i) a time domain quadratic filter to utilize quadratic convolutional networks for extracting periodic impulses; (ii) a frequency domain linear filter composed of a fully-connected neural network to amplify discrete frequency components. Next, we develop a unified framework built upon a deep learning classifier to guide the learning of BD filters. In addition, we devise a physics-informed loss function composed of kurtosis, l2/l4 norm, and a cross-entropy loss to jointly optimize the BD filters and deep learning classifier. In so doing, the fault labels are fully exploited to direct BD to extract features in distinguishing classes amidst strong noise. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first of its kind that BD is successfully applied to bearing fault diagnosis. Experimental results from three different datasets highlight that ClassBD outperforms other state-of-the-art methods under noisy conditions.

NASA's SPARRCI project seeks to tackle these challenges through a catastrophic failure avoidance approach using enhanced battery monitoring and maintenance to detect performance anomalies that can help provide early warnings of potential faults and failures. This study explores a combination of thermal reduce order models (TROM), presented in Khasin et al. (2024), and anomaly detection (AD) algorithms to identify deviation in performance that can serve as a tool for predictive battery maintenance. TROM and AD algorithms were applied to various electric aviation flight profiles (UAS, eVTOL, and NASA's X-57). The results show that TROM parameters are identifiable for the thermal dataset generated by cycling nine commercial cells from three chemistries (Gr-LCO, SiGr-NMC811, and Gr-NCA) to their end-of-life. The summary statistics of cell temperature were neither sensitive nor accurate in detecting cooling faults or sensor errors.

As a result, the demand for new cognitive fault diagnosis algorithms is the need of the hour. Existing deep learning algorithms can detect faults but do not incorporate the system’s underlying physics into the prediction and model training processes. Therefore, the results generated by this class of fault-detecting algorithms sometimes do not make sense and fail to deliver when put to the test in actual operating conditions. We propose an end-to-end, autonomous hybrid physics-infused deep learning framework that consists of a low-fidelity physics model combined with a 1 Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) to address the aforementioned issues. The application system under consideration is a 6-cylinder, 4-stroke, 7.6 L Navistar diesel engine. The physics model in the hybrid framework ensures that the predictions made by the framework are in coherence with the actual dynamics of the engine. In contrast, the deep learning component of the hybrid framework makes up for the simplifications involved during the development of the physics model of the engine, where the 1D CNN module enables robust Spatiotemporal feature extraction. Using empirical results, we demonstrate that our proposed hybrid fault diagnostics framework is autonomous and efficient for fault detection and isolation. The robustness of this framework is put to the test against the data obtained by the engine when subjected to different operating conditions, such as varying speed, changing injection pressure, and injection duration. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024.","1 Dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN); Auto encoder (AE); Engine fault; Fault diagnosis; Physics-informed machine learning","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Diesel engines; Fault detection; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Network coding; 1 dimensional convolutional neural network; Auto encoder; Auto encoders; Convolutional neural network; Engine fault; Faults diagnosis; Learning frameworks; Machine-learning; Physic-informed machine learning; Physics modeling; Failure analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197861526"

Sensors are deployed in CPS to observe its functioning and control systems like actuators, Remote Terminal Units (RTU), programmable logic controllers (PLC), etc., are used to change the state of the CPS. Any abnormal state transitions due to cyber attack or natural fault may not be detected by the traditional Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Behavior specification-based IDS, which employs laws of physics to detect the intrusion, may be helpful in this context. However, specifying acceptable behaviors based on the laws of physics for all the installed control systems for a complex CPS like a smart grid, water treatment plant, etc., is a challenging task. Here, we employ a data-driven strategy to model the behavior of each control system installed in a CPS. Later, we use the models to predict the acceptable states of all the control systems. We utilize an AI-based classifier to model control systems such as actuators. Subsequently, we juxtapose the actual states of the actuators with their predicted states, examining how this combination correlates with the overall state of the CPS to identify anomalies. Typically, there should be a strong correlation between predicted and actual states, making the Hamming distance between them a crucial factor in our experimentation. To establish the relationship between controller states and CPS states, we employ a novel deep neural network-based approach for classification. Experimental validation of our approach leverages data from a water treatment testbed, where we achieve superior performance compared to the most state-of-the-art methods, achieving a F1-score of 0.96. © Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Computer Applications and Management 2024.","actuator modeling; anomaly detection; cyber physical system; Industrial control system; Intrusion Detection","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201793818"

Traditional diagnostic methods struggle with robust and interpretable fusion of multi-source information， limiting their practical deployment. This paper proposes a dual-channel intelligent diagnostic method for robotic transmission mechanisms， integrating physics-driven sensitivity weighting and residual uncertainty compensation (RUC). Specifically， vibration and torque signals, representing structural response and driving excitation respectively, are selected due to their distinct temporal scales and complementary physical characteristics. A three-layer mapping (fault type-dynamic response characteristic-sensing channel) is constructed to quantify channel dominance for different fault modes. Then，a multi-scale sensitivity evaluation mechanism based on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)， modulation index (MI)， and kurtosis guides adaptive weight allocation，while the RUC strategy enhances the expression of features from weakly dominant channels，improving fusion stability. Finally，a physically interpretable and lightweight diagnostic framework is established. Experiments conducted on a public gearbox dataset validate that the proposed method provides superior diagnostic accuracy，interpretability，and deployment potential，demonstrating significant promise for physically consistent multi-source fusion diagnosis in robotic transmission systems. © 2025 Nanjing University of Aeronautics an Astronautics.

However, it is important to consider that physics-based engineering models often carry assumptions, simplifications, and general imperfections when representing real-world dynamics. This research article investigates how imperfections in physics-based engineering models affect the accuracy of Physics-guided Neural Networks (PGNNs). Specifically, the study examines neural networks applied in fault detection for nonlinear dynamical systems. The PGNN models used in this article combine simulated measurement data with physics-based model estimates to augment the feature space. This improves training and inference, enhancing the neural networks' fault detection capabilities. The results shared in this article demonstrate that ideal PGNNs can significantly outperform unguided neural networks in detecting faults. However, introducing imperfections in the physics-based model reveals that small inaccuracies can lead to a drastic reduction in fault detection performance. The effectiveness of the PGNN is highly dependent on the reliability of the physics-based model and the underlying dynamics of the system. We explain the likely cause of these findings and highlight the need for careful consideration when applying PGNNs in engineering applications. © 2024","Dynamical systems; Fault detection; Model imperfections; Physics-guided neural network","Engineering modelling; Faults detection; Machine-learning; Model imperfection; Neural-networks; Physic-guided neural network; Physics-based; Physics-based models; Real-world; World dynamics; Neural network models","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214328368"

While deep-learning models have demonstrated remarkable performance in classifying the health states of mechanical systems under homogeneous conditions, their effectiveness often deteriorates because these models generalize poorly to operating conditions that differ from those seen during training, leading to a marked drop in classification accuracy. Moreover, the features extracted by conventional deep-learning models typically lack interpretability from a signal-processing perspective. To tackle these challenges, we propose a SKAN that employs a signal-processing-inspired network structure coupled with a physics-based feature-weighting strategy. Specifically, the proposed method leverages domain knowledge from spectral kurtosis to autonomously extract fault-related features with physical significance, while effectively transmitting these fault-related features through successive deep-learning layers. This novel approach not only improves fault-diagnosis capabilities but also significantly boosts the interpretability of the model, a critical aspect often overlooked in traditional methods. In this paper, we also introduce the SKAN-gram, which is an innovative feature representation technique that employs a binary tree format to further advance interpretability. SKAN's effectiveness is validated in our research by applying it to three case studies under various operating conditions, with various loads & speeds and time-varying speed conditions.

The challenge of reliable and timely identification of both single and multiple simultaneous faults under conditions of limited access to labeled data has been addressed. A threat to the safe operation of autonomous equipment is a common challenge in the field operating conditions where traditional model-based or data-driven approaches, used individually, prove to be ineffective. This work presents a hybrid approach to fault detection. The proposed solution combines an analytical bond-graph model and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The bond-graph generates residuals — the difference between values calculated based on the system physical laws and sensor measurements. The residuals are then analyzed by the CNN which is trained to detect and classify faults based on their characteristic features. Linear Fractional Transformation is employed to account for parameter uncertainties (e.g., resistance or capacitance). This approach allows combining a priori knowledge of the system physics with the capabilities of deep learning. The effectiveness of the approach was evaluated on a simulator of a hydraulic steering control system for autonomous equipment. Gaussian noise was added to the simulation to simulate real-world conditions. The experiments included incipient, abrupt, single, and multiple faults. Tests with varying amounts of training data, using sample sizes less than 128, demonstrated the higher effectiveness of the proposed hybrid approach compared to classical machine learning methods (such as Random Forest or K-Nearest Neighbors). A solution is proposed for fault detection in hydraulic control systems of autonomous equipment. The developed approach is particularly effective with limited data, making it suitable for field conditions. It allows for timely detection and classification of faults (e.g., valve leaks or solenoid valve failures), which reduces the risk of failures and ensures the safety of autonomous equipment. The results can be adapted and implemented for electrical, mechanical, and other complex technical systems. © 2025, Int. J. Pharm. Sci. Res.

Wear is one of the most critical fault mechanisms in gears, yet vibration-based gear diagnosis has mainly progressed for localized tooth faults due to the complexities associated with distributed wear. This study proposes a novel strategy for gear wear monitoring aligning with digital twins’ foundations, by integrating experiments, dynamic modeling, physical preprocessing, and machine learning. First, we propose an unsupervised learning-based sensitive health indicator for early wear detection, grounded in advanced physical preprocessing. Then, we introduce a novel few-shot learning approach for estimating wear severity, addressing the scarcity of labeled faulty measured data in real-world scenarios. We train a severity regressor using an extensive simulated training dataset, augmented and adapted to the inspected gear through transfer function estimation. The few-shot learning framework relies on measured training data, which includes healthy samples and a few faulty samples from a one label. The transfer of knowledge between the simulated and measured training datasets enables the severity regressor to make predictions on unseen measured data. The proposed strategy is demonstrated through controlled-degradation tests in gear wear, showcasing its superior performance in both fault detection and severity estimation, comparable to that of a fully supervised model, as if labeled measured data were available. Above all, this study highlights how a synergy between physics-based and AI-based approaches enhances performance while addressing practical challenges in wear diagnosis, paving the way for the implementation of digital twins in future endeavors. © 2025 The Author(s)","Fault severity estimation; Few-shot learning; Mechanical engineering; Poor lubrication; Spur gear; Steel; Vibration signals; Wear","Gear teeth; Gear trains; Wear of materials; Dynamics models; Fault severities; Fault severity estimation; Few-shot learning; Gear wear; Lubrication /; Mechanical; Poor lubrication; Training dataset; Vibration signal; Spur gears","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85215844634"

Yet, traditional diagnostic approaches often fall short due to the lack of labeled data and the intricate, nonlinear nature of fault patterns in real-world scenarios. To tackle these issues, this study introduces an innovative fault diagnosis framework for HTS cables, leveraging transfer learning (TL), adaptive grey wolf optimization (AGWO), and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) networks. Within this framework, AGWO is utilized to fine-tune the hyperparameters of BiLSTM through a comprehensive global search, significantly boosting the model's capacity to capture the transient behaviors of HTS cable quenching. Additionally, transfer learning is employed to transfer fault-related insights from a source domain to the target domain, effectively addressing the challenge of limited data and enhancing the model's adaptability across diverse operating conditions. Experimental findings reveal that the proposed method achieves an impressive 98.2% accuracy in diagnosing short-circuit faults.

The quality of CZ silicon crystals significantly affects the yield, performance, and even the reliability of ICs. As the feature size of ICs continues to decrease, stringent requirements are placed on various quality factors of CZ silicon crystals, including the radial uniformity of dopants, the concentration and radial uniformity of oxygen impurities, and the sizes and densities of grown-in oxygen precipitates and crystal-originated particles (COPs).The CZ growth of large-diameter CZ silicon crystals involves the interplay of multiple physical fields including thermal, flow, and electromagnetic fields. The coupling between these fields significantly affects the formation and evolution of the aforementioned defects, as well as the impurity concentration and distribution within the CZ silicon crystal. Under the circumstances, the traditional “trial-and-error” approaches to process optimization for large-diameter CZ silicon crystal growth are not only time-consuming but also entail substantial economic costs. With the advances in high-performance computational capabilities, the comprehensive numerical simulations of crystal growth that integrate multi-physics field coupling are increasingly becoming indispensable for optimizing CZ silicon crystal growth processes. Furthermore, with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), the deep learning-based surrogate models can replace the complex physical models to achieve high-accuracy simulations with reduced computational resources. AI can also learn the key physical principles governing the silicon crystal growth from the historical simulation results and the industrial production data, allowing iterative learning through simulated experiments on how different process conditions affect the silicon crystal quality. This enables an incremental approach toward identifying the optimal process parameters in complex multi-physics fields, thus providing the guideline for practical silicon crystal growth optimization.For the control of grown-in defects such as oxygen precipitates and COPs in CZ silicon crystals, an effective approach, besides improving the hot-zone structure and optimizing process parameters, is the intentional doping of impurities that are either benign or beneficial to silicon crystal performances. To effectively control the defects via doping of specific impurities, systematic studies are needed on the effects of non-electrically active impurities (e.g., nitrogen, carbon, germanium, and tin) and dopants (e.g., phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and boron) on the equilibrium concentrations of point defects at different temperatures, and on the interactions of these impurities with the point defects and oxygen impurities under varying thermal conditions.In a word, the quality control of large-diameter CZ silicon crystals is a critical link in the IC industry chain. Its associated theories and technologies intersect the disciplines such as mathematics, physics, materials science, computer science, automatic control, and AI. Since the beginning of the 21st century, the requirements on the quality of silicon wafers have been increasingly stringent due to the continuous reduction in IC feature size. To meet these requirements, the interdisciplinary integration must drive ongoing refinement in quality control theories and technologies for CZ silicon crystals, thereby improving the silicon wafer quality from the starting point of crystal growth. © 2025 Science Press.

Traditional methods for condition monitoring rely on physics-based models and statistical analysis techniques. However, these approaches often face challenges in dealing with complex systems and the limited availability of accurate physical models. In recent years, physics-informed machine learning (PIML) has emerged as a promising approach for condition monitoring, combining the strengths of physics-based modelling and data-driven machine learning. This study presents a comprehensive overview of PIML techniques in the context of condition monitoring. The central concept driving PIML is the incorporation of known physical laws and constraints into machine learning algorithms, enabling them to learn from available data while remaining consistent with physical principles. Through fusing domain knowledge with data-driven learning, PIML methods offer enhanced accuracy and interpretability in comparison to purely data-driven approaches. In this comprehensive survey, detailed examinations are performed with regard to the methodology by which known physical principles are integrated within machine learning frameworks, as well as their suitability for specific tasks within condition monitoring. Incorporation of physical knowledge into the ML model may be realized in a variety of methods, with each having its unique advantages and drawbacks. The distinct advantages and limitations of each methodology for the integration of physics within data-driven models are detailed, considering factors such as computational efficiency, model interpretability, and generalizability to different systems in condition monitoring and fault detection. Several case studies and works of literature utilizing this emerging concept are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of PIML in condition monitoring applications. From the literature reviewed, the versatility and potential of PIML in condition monitoring may be demonstrated. Novel PIML methods offer an innovative solution for addressing the complexities of condition monitoring and associated challenges. This comprehensive survey helps form the foundation for future work in the field. As the technology continues to advance, PIML is expected to play a crucial role in enhancing maintenance strategies, system reliability, and overall operational efficiency in engineering systems. © 2024 The Author(s)","Anomaly detection; Condition monitoring; Deep learning; Machine learning; Physics-informed machine learning","Computational efficiency; Condition monitoring; Deep learning; Fault detection; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Statistical Physics; Anomaly detection; Data driven; Deep learning; Engineering systems; Machine learning methods; Machine-learning; Physic-informed machine learning; Physical principles; Physics-based models; Anomaly detection","Review","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198938963"

The optimal hybrid model, combining RILS-ROLS and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), enhances prediction accuracy, particularly under extreme conditions, achieving error reductions of up to 55.2% compared to standalone models while maintaining lower complexity. By correcting residuals from the physics-informed RILS-ROLS model with the adaptive CatBoost model, the approach effectively captures nonlinearities, outperforming traditional methods that typically exhibit errors exceeding 5%–10%.

This is achieved through an innovative proposal that merges machine learning techniques with thermoeconomics to perform diagnoses in building thermal systems and identify cost overruns generated by intrinsic anomalies in the components and quantify their induced effects on the rest of the components. To date, the few contributions combining these techniques have been limited to industrial applications and cost calculation, without addressing their application to building thermal systems, both from a dynamic perspective and for maintenance purposes. Research using Physics-Informed Neural Networks, PINNs, in this area is even scarcer, which underlines the complexity of defining a suitable methodology. Thus, the proposal integrates PINNs with a thermoeconomic diagnosis based on characteristic curves, allowing the comparison of the current operating condition with an anomaly-free reference condition to assess the existence of anomalies and their effects. For this reason, reference models are generated for the first time with PINNs, which represents a break with the conventional maintenance approaches used by professionals in the sector. Therefore, this methodology incorporates techniques that require specialised knowledge in thermodynamic and informatics areas, which motivates the present work to be focused on the exhaustive description of the methodology and to highlight the importance of continuing to explore lines of research in this unexplored field. © 2024 by the authors.","fault detection; neural network; smart maintenance; thermoeconomic","Building thermal system; Energy in buildings; Faults detection; In-buildings; Neural-networks; Optimisations; Smart maintenance; Thermal; Thermoeconomic; Zero energies; Zero energy buildings","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211815316"

The Finite Element Method (FEM) is commonly employed for high-fidelity simulations, but its precision heavily depends on exact physical parameters such as the damping coefficient. These parameters are difficult to measure directly, and existing methods based on empirical values are both time-consuming and often inaccurate. This paper proposes a method using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) combined with experimental data to accurately invert damping parameters in vibration systems, exemplified by GIS. PINNs integrate physical laws into neural networks, improving accuracy, robustness, and generalization. By combining experimental data with PINNs, high precision and interpretability of key physical parameters in FEM simulations are achieved. The results show that without noise, the waveform similarity between the FEM and the experimental results is high, with an amplitude similarity coefficient of 0.869 and a normalized cross-correlation of 0.926. At the 1% noise level, the inversion error of the damping parameter is only 3%, and the method shows good noise resistance up to the 5% noise level. This approach improves simulation reliability and provides a new path to enhance the transparency and diagnostic capabilities of power equipment. © The Author(s) 2025.","Damping vibration system; GIS fault diagnosis; Parameter inversion; Physics-informed neural networks(PINNs)","adult; article; cross correlation; diagnosis; female; finite element analysis; gas; geographic information system; high-fidelity simulation; human experiment; nerve cell network; noise; physical parameters; reliability; simulation; vibration; waveform","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010181264"

The system models serve as digital surrogates that generate large quantities of data for training DNNs which would otherwise be difficult to obtain from the real-life system. In such a scenario, the uncertainty in the system model and in the DNN parameters will influence the predictions of the DNN. Here, we quantify the impact of this uncertainty on the performance of DNNs. The uncertainty from the system model is captured with two methods, namely assumed density filtering and heteroskedastic modelling. In addition to quantification, these methods allow training DNNs in an uncertainty-aware manner. The uncertainty in the DNN parameters is captured with Monte Carlo dropout. The proposed approach is demonstrated for fault diagnosis of electric power lines. Data generated from a physics-based model calibrated with real-life measurements is used to train three neural network architectures for fault diagnosis. The results reveal that uncertainty-aware models can provide 1% to 19% improvement in classification accuracy than their deterministic counterparts. The uncertainty-aware models also exhibit better robustness to uncertainty and, thus, offer more reliable models for deployment. Remarkably, the article provides a system-agnostic framework for uncertainty-aware training of DNN models for fault diagnosis and monitoring that explicitly accounts for the synthetic nature of training data. © 2024 The Author(s)","Assumed density filtering; Bayesian neural networks; Heteroskedastic neural networks; Uncertainty quantification","Bayesian networks; Electric lines; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Network architecture; Uncertainty analysis; Assumed density filtering; Bayesian neural networks; Faults diagnosis; Heteroskedastic neural network; Monitoring diagnosis; Neural network parameters; Neural-networks; System models; Uncertainty; Uncertainty quantifications; Deep neural networks","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199909272"

Therefore, development of such models can be extremely useful for design optimization, controls, fault detection and diagnostics of vapor compression based building Heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. As the complexity and scale of vapor compression systems (VCS) increase rapidly across the industry, a modular approach of generating and interconnecting data-driven component models enables model reuse and efficient adaption to arbitrary system layouts. Despite the flexibility, the modular integration for system model generation can suffer from nonphysical behaviors of violating conservation laws due to inevitable prediction errors associated with each component. This paper presents a data-driven modeling framework that exploits state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for constructing component models, while enforcing physical conservation for system simulations. A general-purpose system solver is developed to handle arbitrary configurations by automatically integrating data-driven or interchangeable physics-based component models into a system model.

While conventional continuous commissioning (CCx) is effective in detecting energy performance gaps, MBCCx goes further by using a system model as a reference to pinpoint operational inefficiencies and control faults arising from subsystem integration. The core of the proposed methodology lies in a calibrated physics-based model that represents the system performance as intended during the design phase. A key advantage is its applicability early in a building's operational phase, when data is limited, unlike data-driven methods that rely on extensive historical datasets. This enables the identification of energy-saving opportunities before the system reaches a stable operational state. To address the limitations of prior studies that often focus solely on individual GSHP component performance, this work pioneers the application of MBCCx to whole buildings equipped with GSHPs. The proposed approach employs a detailed 3D building model and component-level HVAC modeling to predict parameters such as room temperatures, heat pump power, and ground heat exchanger temperatures under normal conditions. Significant deviations between monitored values and model predictions serve as indicators of underperforming components or control sequence anomalies. The anomaly detection accuracy is then improved by merging HVAC system and GSHP performance indicators. The methodology is demonstrated through a case study of a recently retrofitted elementary school in Québec, Canada, equipped with five standing column wells as ground heat exchangers. © 2025 The Authors","Ground-source heat pump; Model-based continuous commissioning; Monitoring; Standing column wells; White-box modeling","Air source heat pumps; Building components; HVAC; Conditioning systems; Continuous commissioning; Ground heat exchangers; Groundsource heat pump (GSHP); Heating ventilation and air conditioning; Model-based continuous commissioning; Model-based OPC; Performance gaps; Standing column wells; White-box models; Geothermal heat pumps","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217975489"

Additionally, the encapsulated power devices are difficult to detect during regular high-altitude inspections making yaw converter failures highly concealed. If the fault is not detected early, it may lead to secondary faults in the converter and potentially damage the yaw motor. Considering the feasibility of engineering application, the rapidness of the diagnostic process and the ability to resist interference, an open-circuit fault diagnosis method of yaw inverters based on current vector magnitude and phase interval is proposed. Firstly, considering the characteristics of yaw operation, the three-phase current data outputted by the inverter, collected from the initiation of yaw until just before the yaw speed reaches its maximum, is utilized to obtain the magnitude and phase information of the current vector through the Clarke transform. Secondly, by setting a threshold for the standard deviation of the current vector magnitude, the identification of open-circuit faults in the inverter is achieved. Subsequently, feature quantities are constructed based on the current vector phase interval to locate the open-circuit fault in the inverter, enabling the diagnosis of single-switch and double-switch open-circuit faults for yaw inverters. Finally, the effectiveness of proposed method is validated through simulation and physics experiments. Research indicates that the proposed method requires no large number of fault samples and, with simple threshold settings, can accurately identify and localize 21 types of open-circuit faults in yaw inverters, under both noise interference and varying load conditions. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025.","Current vector; Open-circuit fault; Standard deviation; Yaw inverter","Computer testing; Electric fault location; Fault detection; Solar power generation; Current vectors; Faults diagnosis; Inverter-based; On currents; On-currents; Open-circuit fault; Power devices; Standard deviation; Vector magnitude; Yaw inverter; Wind turbines","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002642987"

To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes an interpretable wear detection method for the friction pairs of axial piston pumps based on physics informed neural networks. First, we establish an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the time derivative of discharge pressure to relate the instantaneous discharge pressure with the fluid film thicknesses in friction pairs that represent the wear condition of axial piston pumps. Second, we develop a physics informed neural network and a multi-parameter dynamic identification method to identify the fluid film thickness in each friction pair by inversely solving the ODE based on observed discharge pressure signals. Finally, we propose an interpretable wear detection method based on the pump's volumetric efficiency and effect size of fluid film thickness. Experimental results suggest that the identification results of fluid film thickness in the friction pairs have a good physical consistency, and the proposed method can locate the worn friction pair with a high model interpretability. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Axial piston pump; Friction pair; Model interpretability; Physics informed neural network; Wear detection","Discharge (fluid mechanics); Friction; Hydraulic equipment; Hydraulic machinery; Hydraulics; Pistons; Tribology; Wear of materials; Axial piston pump; Detection methods; Discharge pressures; Fluid film thickness; Friction pair; Interpretability; Model interpretability; Neural-networks; Physic informed neural network; Wear detection; Reciprocating pumps","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002488191"

While conventional machine learning and physics-based approaches remain prevalent, DL models provide superior performance in terms of accuracy, automation, and adaptability. This systematic review investigates trends in DL applications within mechanical engineering from 2015 to 2024. An initial search using the query “deep learning AND mechanical engineering” across seven major databases—Google Scholar, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, ERIC, Science Direct, Compendex, and Wiley Online Library—yielded 149 articles. After applying exclusion criteria (published before 2014, non-English, short or work-in-progress papers, not DL and/or mechanical engineering focus, or conceptual papers), 49 studies were selected for in-depth analysis. The results indicate that DL models improve prediction accuracy by 10%–35% over traditional techniques across various applications, including fault detection in rotating machinery and microstructural analysis in materials engineering. Despite notable gains, challenges persist related to data availability, computational intensity, and model interpretability. This review highlights the importance of addressing these limitations and recommends future research efforts toward improving model generalization, incorporating explainable AI techniques, and optimizing DL deployment under limited-data scenarios. Furthermore, the integration of DL with Industry 4.0 technologies—such as IoT, digital twins, and cyber-physical systems—presents a promising direction for real-time, intelligent decision-making in mechanical engineering systems. This review serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to apply or advance DL methods in mechanical engineering contexts. © 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","deep learning; fault diagnosis; material science; mechanical engineering","Microstructure; Papermaking machinery; Predictive maintenance; Rotating machinery; Complex problems; Conventional machines; Deep learning; Faults diagnosis; Learning models; Machine-learning; Material science; Mechanical; Predictive maintenance; Systematic Review; Paper","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004666066"

Therefore, in this work, a physics-informed machine learning (PIML) approach is proposed, which can effectively distinguish between CAs and OCFs in EDS. In this regard, the unique features associated with stator current, resulting from various CPAs, are used to estimate the stator voltage characteristics through a synchronous motor mathematical model. The proposed voltage-based features characterizing better correlation via distinctive EDS transients in response to these anomalies are further used as the system's prior information by a machine learning (ML) classifier. Moreover, active thermal management (ATM)-based model predictive control (MPC) is utilized in the control layer due to its benefits in device-level thermal cycling and power quality. In addition, various variations in electrical, mechanical, and thermal characteristics due to CPAs in EDS have also been analyzed. The presented approach is evaluated for the US06 standard drive cycle in real time via controller-hardware-in-the-loop (CHIL) experiment for various case study scenarios, resulting in a classification accuracy of 98.92%.  © 2015 IEEE.","Active thermal management (ATM)-based model predictive control (MPC); cyberattacks (CAs); electric drive system (EDS); physical fault detection; physics-informed machine learning (PIML)","Computer debugging; Computer viruses; Electric circuit breakers; Electric fault location; Hardware-in-the-loop simulation; Intelligent systems; Invariance; Machine learning; Speed regulators; Traction motors; Active-thermal management-based model predictive control; Cyber-attacks; Electric drive system; Faults detection; Machine-learning; Model-predictive control; Physic-informed machine learning; Physical fault detection; Physical faults; Thermal; Predictive control systems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206092632"

When a failure occurs, it can lead to an inability to perform the required functions, potentially resulting in a complete shutdown of the mechanism and causing significant operational disruptions. Consequently, deploying expert methods for fault detection and diagnosis is crucial to ensuring the reliability and efficiency of these systems. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques show promise for fault diagnosis, but their accuracy can be hindered by noise and manufacturing imperfections that distort mechanical signatures. Thorough data analysis and preprocessing are vital to preserving these critical features. Validating approaches through numerical simulations before experimentation is essential to identify model limitations and minimize risks. A hybrid approach, combining AI and physics-based models, could provide a robust solution by leveraging the strengths of both domains: AI for its ability to process large volumes of data and physics-based models for their reliability in modeling complex mechanical behaviors. This paper proposes a comprehensive diagnostic methodology. It starts with feature extraction from time-domain analysis, which helps identify critical indicators of gearbox performance. Following this, a feature selection process is applied using the Fisher criterion, which ensures that only the most relevant features are retained for further analysis. These selected features are then employed to train an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), a sophisticated approach that combines the learning capabilities of neural networks with the reasoning abilities of fuzzy logic. The proposed methodology is evaluated using a dataset of gear faults generated through energy simulations based on a six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) model, followed by a secondary validation on an experimental dataset. © 2025 by the authors.","ANFIS; diagnostic; energy simulation; Fisher criterion; gearbox","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008993056"

Traditional deep learning models for sensor fault detection rely solely on data-driven patterns, often lacking interpretability and robustness. This article proposes a Physics-Guided Bayesian Neural Network (PINN-BNN) model that integrates physics-informed learning with Bayesian inference to improve fault detection in wind turbines. The proposed approach enforces domain-specific constraints to ensure physically consistent predictions while quantifying uncertainty for risk-aware decision-making. The model is evaluated using a real-world wind turbine sensor dataset, achieving an accuracy of 97.6%, a recall of 91.8%, and an AUC-ROC of 0.987. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis reveals that gearbox temperature, blade vibration, and generator torque are the most critical features influencing failure predictions. Bayesian uncertainty estimation further improves interpretability by assigning confidence levels to each prediction. A comparative study with ten baseline models, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Transformer-based models, and traditional machine learning classifiers, demonstrates that the PINN-BNN model outperforms existing approaches while maintaining computational efficiency with a training time of 39.8 minutes and an inference time of 1.7 ms per sample. The integration of physics-informed learning ensures that the model generalizes well to varying environmental conditions, reducing false negatives and minimizing unexpected system failures.

During the last few years, hydrogen energy has proven to be a crucial factor under the current conditions. Although the energy conversion process in polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) is clean and noiseless since the only by-products are heat and water, the inside phenomena are not simple. As a result, correct monitoring of the health situation of the device is required to perform efficiently. This paper aims to explore and evaluate the machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models for predicting classification fault detection in PEFCs. It represents a support for decision-making by the fuel cell operator or user. Seven ML and DL model classifiers are considered. A database comprising 182,156 records and 20 variables arising from the fuel cell's energy conversion process and operating conditions is considered. This dataset is unbalanced; therefore, techniques to balance are applied and analyzed in the training and testing of several models. The results showed that the logistic regression (LR), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and Naive Bayes (NB) models present similar and optimal trends in terms of performance indicators and computational cost; unlike support vector machine (SMV) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) whose performance is affected when the data is balanced and even presents a higher computational cost. Therefore, it is a novel approach for fault detection analysis in PEFC that combines the interpretability of different ML and DL algorithms while addressing data imbalance, so common in the real world, using resampling techniques. This methodology provides clear information for the model decision-making process, improving confidence and facilitating further optimization; in contrast to traditional physics-based models, paving the way for data-driven control strategies. © The Author(s) 2024.","Classification problems; Deep learning models; Fault detection; Machine learning models; PEFC","Barium compounds; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Deep learning; Electrocatalysts; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Polyelectrolytes; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Solid electrolytes; Statistical tests; Support vector machines; Classification problem; Computational costs; Conversion process; Deep learning model; Faults detection; Integral analysis; Learning models; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Polymer electrolyte fuel cells; Fault detection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185890281"

The pyEPICS interface acted as a conduit, ensuring real-time data exchange and enabling dynamic adjustments to be made based on the algorithm’s outputs. Furthermore, to augment user operation and monitoring capabilities, an intuitive control system studio (CSS) interface was devised. This interface empowered efficient upper-level control and real-time monitoring functions, thereby significantly bolstering the usability and practicality of the system. The CSS interface features a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) that allows operators to monitor and adjust parameters in real-time with ease, enhancing the overall user experience and operational efficiency. Using the 1.7 MV tandem accelerator platform as a testbed, rigorous experiments were conducted to ascertain the feasibility and efficacy of the DE algorithm in beam optimization. These experiments were designed to comprehensively evaluate the algorithm’s performance under various conditions and constraints. During these trials, this paper not only scrutinized the algorithm’s performance but also implemented optimizations and enhancements based on empirical findings. These refinements notably elevate the optimization capabilities of the algorithm, culminating in an impressive beam transfer efficiency of 80%. The methodology encompassed several pivotal steps. Firstly, the DE algorithm using Python was implemented, capitalizing on its robust computational capabilities and inherent flexibility. This implementation allowed for the development of a sophisticated and adaptable algorithmic solution. Subsequently, the algorithm was seamlessly integrated with the EPICS system via the pyEPICS interface, enabling precise control and monitoring of the accelerator beam. The CSS interface was meticulously developed to offer an intuitive and user-friendly graphical interface, facilitating real-time monitoring and adjustment of parameters by operators. The experimental results underscore that the exceptional performance of the DE algorithm in beam tuning. The optimized beam transfer efficiency of 80% constitutes a substantial improvement over traditional manual methods, highlighting the algorithm’s efficacy in enhancing beam-tuning processes. Furthermore, the DE algorithm’s adaptability and robustness were evident in its proficiency to handle a diverse array of beam conditions and constraints, demonstrating its versatility and practical utility.

To tackle the issue, we propose a physics-guided soft sensing (PGSS)-aided fault diagnosis framework to realize efficient and explainable diagnosis without relying on hard-to-measure mechanical parameters online. The framework includes the ID inversion, dual-channel feature extraction, and fault diagnosis tasks. First, a soft sensing (SS) technique is applied to estimate the ID based on easily measured information. Then, we propose a dual-channel feature extraction with curvature analysis for the estimated IDs. Finally, we conduct a neural network-based diagnostic model with a combination of cross-entropy, self-entropy, and regularization terms as optimization strategies, which can improve the generalization and reduce the impact of uncertainty caused by the above SS work.

With the increasing complexity of modern industrial processes, traditional machine health monitoring approaches cannot provide efficient performance. With the massive surge in industrial big data and the advancement in sensing and computational technologies, data-driven machinery fault diagnosis solutions based on machine/deep learning approaches have been used ubiquitously in manufacturing applications. Timely and accurately identifying faulty machine signals is vital in industrial applications for which many relevant solutions have been proposed and are reviewed in many earlier articles. Despite the availability of numerous solutions and reviews on machinery fault diagnosis, existing works often lack several aspects. Most of the available literature has limited applicability in a wide range of manufacturing settings due to their concentration on a particular type of equipment or method of analysis. Additionally, discussions regarding the challenges associated with implementing data-driven approaches, such as dealing with noisy data, selecting appropriate features, and adapting models to accommodate new or unforeseen faults, are often superficial or completely overlooked. Thus, this survey provides a comprehensive review of the articles using different types of machine learning approaches for the detection and diagnosis of various types of machinery faults, highlights their strengths and limitations, provides a review of the methods used for predictive analyses, comprehensively discusses the available machinery fault datasets, introduces future researchers to the possible challenges they have to encounter while using these approaches for fault diagnosis and recommends the probable solutions to mitigate those problems. The future research prospects are also pointed out for a better understanding of the field.

This study proposes a novel baseline modeling approach based on physics-guided multi-model method utilizing the engine condition monitoring measurements. The physics-guided multi-model architecture, comprising a baseline model and compensation models, employs environmental compensation to refine the output parameters. The baseline model is constructed using data from a single environmental condition. Compensation models are built using residual data between baseline model outputs and engine gas path measurements from other environmental conditions. This approach was validated using turboshaft ground test data across different seasons. Baseline models including output power (Pdn), high-pressure compressor outlet pressure (Ps3), and power turbine inlet temperature (Tt45) were developed using both single and multi-model methods. Back propagation (BP) networks and recurrent neural network were used to validate the physics-guided multi-model architectures. Comparing the prediction accuracies of single and multi-models reveals that the multi-model structure offers superior accuracy. The compensation-based multi-model method reduced the mean absolute error (MAE) by 57.3% relative to the uncompensated BP and by 44.6% relative to the multi-input BP, achieving final MAE values of 0.967% for Pdn, 0.78% for Ps3, and 2.3% for Tt45. At the same time, the multi-model approach enhances interpretability by separately predicting the effects of control and environmental parameters on engine monitoring parameters. © 2025 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Addressing 5 research questions and encompassing 111 studies from 2014 to 2024, our study identifies the multifaceted applications of GNNs across different project stages from data enhancement to operational scenario enhancement. When considering integrated Facilities Management (FM) approaches, GNNs are employed for data enhancement purposes, leveraging techniques such as semantic enrichment of Building Information Modelling (BIM), various data imputation scenarios, and semantic segmentation of point clouds to enhance data quality and completeness. Operational scenarios involve the utilisation of GNN algorithms for anomaly detection, fault classification, system optimisation, and forecasting. Methodological optimisations crucial for GNN feasibility include feature engineering, architecture optimisation to balance complexity and overfitting risk, and the integration of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods to enhance model validity and trust. Physical principles integration through Physics-Informed Graph Neural Networks (PIGNNs) further enhances model explainability and validation.

In order to improve the level of operation and maintenance and ensure the safe and reliable operation of the power grid, it is necessary to diagnose the fault of the oil-immersed transformer in time. Most of the traditional fault vibration methods are off-line detection, and are easily disturbed by mechanical deterioration. In order to solve the above problems, this paper established a 3D electromagnetic and stress coupling simulation model of oil-immersed transformer by finite element simulation software. The vibration characteristics of oil-immersed transformer core winding are obtained, and at the same time, this paper obtained the vibration signals at different positions on transformer core winding and oil tank. According to the vibration signal of the transformer, the best measuring point position of the tank wall is proposed to accurately reflect the vibration characteristics of the transformer. The signal data is preprocessed by CEEMDAN decomposition method, and the signal data is classified by GWO-BP composite classification algorithm. This paper proposed an online transformer fault diagnosis method based on vibration signal, which achieves the purpose of accurately diagnosing oil-immersed transformer faults.

However, current data-driven methods are hampered by their reliance on extensive labeled data and their intrinsic lack of interpretability. Pump flow ripple serves as a clear indicator of a pump's health, yet traditional methods of indirectly measuring flow ripple are impractical for in-situ industrial applications. This paper introduces a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework designed to predict pump flow ripple, effectively acting as a high-frequency virtual dynamic flow meter. This innovative framework combines measured pressure ripple data with the fundamental physical principles governing hydraulic pipelines to infer comprehensive field information, including unknown boundary conditions such as pump flow ripple. The PINN approach addresses the inverse problem associated with the pipeline model. We have conducted numerical and experimental investigations to validate the effectiveness of this framework. The results show a close agreement (i.e., within a 0.3% relative L2 error) with the numerical method, confirming the framework's precision in solving the inverse problem of hydraulic pipelines. Experimentally predicted pump flow ripples accurately fault characteristics, underscoring its potential utility. Moreover, we explore the high-frequency hydraulic pipeline inverse problem, revealing that extended PINN (XPINN) and the proposed wavelet feature-based architecture proficiently address high-frequency inverse problems. © 2024","Axial piston pump; Fault diagnosis; Flow ripple; Inverse problems; Physics-informed neural network","Fault detection; Flowmeters; Nickel pipe; Pistons; Reciprocating pumps; Screw pumps; Turbine pumps; Water pipelines; Axial piston pump; Faults diagnosis; Flow ripple; Fluid power systems; High frequency HF; Network frameworks; Neural-networks; Optimal performance; Physic-informed neural network; Pump flow; Inverse problems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214327447"

It is an effective and cost-saving solution to this demand to construct a high-precision wind turbine digital twin model under normal operating conditions based on multivariate monitoring data, and to realize root cause localization based on prediction deviation and backtracking analysis. This paper proposes a root cause localization framework for wind turbines based on explicit-implicit knowledge fusion and multivariate time-series graph neural networks, fully utilizing the inter-variable dependencies mining capability of graph structure learning and the temporal prediction advantage of time-series graph neural networks. Five types of explicit knowledge based on explicit rules are constructed to describe the explicit relationships between monitoring variables. The fused knowledge (i.e., graph adjacency matrix) is obtained by fusing the explicit knowledge with the implicit knowledge hidden in the data through a quasi-hard-attention mechanism based on the idea of graph structure learning. A high-precision digital twin model for wind turbines based on fused knowledge is constructed using the multivariate time-series graph neural network. The anomaly degree of monitoring variables’ state is defined based on the prediction deviation, with which the propagation of fault's state over time can be accurately described, and the root cause localization through backtracking analysis can be achieved. Case studies are conducted using field fault data from a wind farm, a sugar factory and a thermal power plant. The results show that the proposed framework can provide a solution for studying the fault propagation process and root cause localization, also demonstrating certain robustness and generalizability. © 2024","graph neural network; multivariate time-series forecasting; Supervisory control and data acquisition; Wind turbine","Anomaly detection; Backpropagation; Cost benefit analysis; Forecasting; Graph neural networks; Graph theory; SCADA systems; Sugar factories; Sugar industry; Thermoelectric power plants; Time series; Time series analysis; Wind power; Wind turbines; Fault propagation; Graph neural networks; High-precision; Localisation; Multivariate time series; Multivariate time-series forecasting; Propagation analysis; Root cause; Supervisory control and data acquisition; Time series forecasting; Graphic methods","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191335094"

Many applications are however adapting structures and approaches from fields where NNs are highly established (e.g., image classification). This is done despite many neural network layers presenting strong similarities to signal processing steps that are well established in MCM. This paper aims at providing a mathematical analysis of typical NN architectures and layers, with specific attention to similarities to common signal processing steps such as filtering, downsampling, and enveloping. The set of strong analogies between NN and traditional MCM tools enables this work to provide MCM-specific guidelines for the design and tuning of NN architectures for MCM-specific applications. Most MCM applications are often characterised by periodic and cyclostationary signals, a situation not frequently encountered in many other NN applications. Hence, the Fourier-based explanation of the typical NN layers will be specific to the solution of typical MCM problems (e.g., diagnostics of gears and bearings). The study is aligned with the current trends of explainable AI and physics informed neural networks (PINN), in the sense that it aims at producing mathematical rules for a rational design of the network, drawing on the expertise accumulated in decades of signal processing for MCM. This is however done without upsetting traditional NN architectures, but rather trying to provide clear reasons for the setting of network parameters.

In contrast, our model has parallel 1D CNN modules that simultaneously extract features from both the time and frequency domains. These multi-domain features are then fused to capture comprehensive information on bearing fault signals. Additionally, physics-informed preprocessings are incorporated into the frequency-spectral signals to further improve the classification accuracy. Furthermore, a channel and spatial attention module is added to effectively enhance the noise-robustness by focusing more on the fault characteristic features.

To address this issue, it is important to develop an efficient fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) system. Data-driven approaches that use machine learning (ML) algorithms offer many advantages over physics-based approaches for HVAC systems since they operate in a transient state most of the time. However, the lack of transparency of ML algorithms makes stakeholders hesitant to adopt them for FDD. Therefore, this study examines the use of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to improve FDD in Air Handling Units, to enhance their interpretability. Four machine learning (ML) techniques were evaluated based on fault detection rate and F1 score, and XGBoost algorithm was determined to be the optimal choice for the FDD model. The study utilized SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for interpreting the developed model. The SHAP summary plot and the SHAP waterfall plot are used for global and local explanations, respectively. The study successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of XAI techniques in improving the transparency and interpretability of ML models for FDD in Air Handling Units. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.","Air Handling Units; Explainable AI; FDD","Energy utilization; Fault detection; HVAC; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Air-handling unit; Conditioning systems; Energy in buildings; Energy-consumption; Explainable AI; Fault detection and diagnosis; Heating ventilation and air conditioning; Interpretability; Machine learning algorithms; Shapley; Transparency","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188730594"

The OT of a Navy ship is vulnerable to exploitation and intrusion, resulting in anomalies that can lead to cascading failures. This paper presents a novel method to effectively detect and classify physical intrusions into shipboard operational components, which can manifest in power data. A physics-based model is used to simulate a shipboard power system to create realistic test data while adhering to the Military Interface Standard 1399 (MIL-STD-1399). A long short term memory (LSTM) machine learning algorithm, modeled in Python, is used to detect anomalies in a shipboard OT. We inject synthetic anomalies and use the LSTM model to identify anomalous behavior that may be due to a malicious cyber event. The model generates predictive data, and by comparing the predictive data to current trends, it detects data outliers. We show that our algorithmic framework effectively predicts normal system behavior while identifying deviations indicative of anomalies. The results presented in this paper demonstrate the achievement of high accuracy in anomaly detection using an LSTM. We also provide insights into how this LSTM model can be used for predictive maintenance of shipboard systems in order to allow for targeted maintenance of components when necessary and not only during fixed schedules. This research is critical for improving the operational readiness of the Naval fleet due to both the application of predicting component failures, and protecting ships from cyber threats. © 2024 IEEE.","anomaly; fault; machine learning; operational technology; power system","Anomaly detection; Computer viruses; Network security; Predictive analytics; Problem oriented languages; Warships; Anomaly; Anomaly detection; Fault; Machine-learning; Memory modeling; Operational technologies; Power; Power system; Short term memory; Technology system; Predictive maintenance","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214986771"

Specifically, severe weather conditions can result in a high requirement for the use of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) to regulate the cabin’s thermal comfort, leading to significant demand for battery power. To address this, understanding real-time HVAC power usage can help precise range prediction and control. Furthermore, achieving real-time capability involves exploring simplified control-oriented models for EV HVAC systems. Therefore, this research aims to address the gap between current and previous HVAC modeling research for EVs by providing a detailed discussion of three modeling techniques: physics-based, data-driven, and hybrid models. Later, various evaluation metrics, such as modeling level capability, accuracy, complexity, generalization, adaptability, cost, and required effort, are defined and used to compare these models.

A fault detection framework based on artificial intelligence and a rigid-body model of a system (as a digital experiment) is proposed to detect four of the most common faults in automotive drum brakes. First, a contact mechanics-based nonlinear model of a drum brake (incorporating conformal contact between the brake shoes and the brake drum) is developed to estimate the dynamic response accurately. The predictions from this model are compared with the data available in the literature. The responses estimated from the model with a known level of faults form the input data set for various fault quantification algorithms. Sensitivity-based pruning technique in conjunction with an artificial neural network is used to select the optimal set of features for which the physical interpretations are deduced. The developed fault detection methodologies are quantitatively compared, and the most applicable among them is determined based on the detection accuracy and the computational cost. Finally, the robustness of the selected methodology is tested under the presence of white Gaussian noise in the measured signals. The proposed framework and the selected methodology will help design an accurate health monitoring tool to diagnose faults in automotive drum brakes.

As a key component, condition monitoring of mainshaft bearing (MB) is critical to ensure the safe and stable operation of wind turbines. Nevertheless, due to harsh operating environments and ultra-low rotating speeds, conventional diagnostics based on vibration analysis always perform poorly. More importantly, naturally damaged MB usually presents compound faults, which further increases the diagnostic difficulty. To resolve this issue, a generalized sparse spectral coherence using acoustic emission (AE) is proposed for compound fault diagnosis of MB. Firstly, to obtain synchronized rotating speeds, physics-inspired sparse learning is innovatively developed to estimate rotational speed from AE signals themselves. Subsequently, by introducing the lp/lq norm, a generalized sparse cyclic spectrum is constructed for compound fault diagnosis. On this basis, the data-driven optimization scheme is then designed to improve diagnostic accuracy. Finally, the superiority of the developed method is validated by simulation analysis and engineering applications.

Based on the finite element method (FEM), the method aims to achieve non-invasive localization of these faults, thereby minimizing loss attributed to troubleshooting and maintenance downtime. Firstly, as a prerequisite for solving the coupled temperature field, an applied circuit method is employed to ascertain the internal loss of the transformer. This determination relies on investigating the influence of internal loss in the oil-immersed transformers for diagnosing under rated operating conditions. Secondly, the internal temperature distribution within the transformer and the condition of the transformer oil are comprehensively analyzed and validated by using an electromagnetic-fluid-solid coupled finite element simulation. Lastly, relying on the simulation outcomes under fault-free conditions, a fault model of the transformer core is established. Subsequently, the output data of the model are classified and localized using deep belief networks. This approach resolves the problems associated with masking transformer fault data signals and acquiring data. The results indicate that the temperature data obtained from the temperature field simulation exhibit an error of less than 2.6% when compared to actual values.

The traditional approaches for gear diagnostics in the past were focused mainly on fault detection. Improved understanding of physics of gear interaction, together with significant progress in dynamic modelling and the new era of artificial intelligence, make it possible for researchers to take on more challenging tasks such as fault severity estimation (FSE) and gear prognosis. This study presents a novel, hybrid strategy for combining physics of failure of machine elements with AI, specifically FSE of tooth breakage faults in spur gears, by a unique fusion of dynamic modelling, experimental characterization, feature extraction, and unsupervised machine learning algorithms. The novelty of the proposed strategy is its logic flow, which starts with a fundamental and deep understanding of the physical phenomena in realistic simulations. The extracted features are selected based on physical insights. The training dataset includes healthy measured data and simulations of healthy and faulty gear to compensate the lack of faulty data in real case scenarios. Discrepancies between the simulations and reality are reduced by passing the simulated signal through transfer functions estimated from experiments. The severity of the fault is estimated according to a “traffic-light” classification strategy, in which, for the first time, the fault geometry is employed to set thresholds for health indicators (HIs). This study shows that a wide set of sensitive features should be used for an early detection, while a smaller and more basic set of features is sufficient for fault severity classification. The suggested strategy is demonstrated on data from an actual testbed; and it is shown to detect breakage faults and estimate their severity, both by zero-shot learning (that is, without training on any measured faulty instances). The strategy can be applied to other systems and likely generalized, thus showing the power of hybrid approaches that combine physical insights with data-driven models. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Dynamic model; Gear diagnosis; Health indicator; Intelligent fault diagnosis; Tooth breakage; Unsupervised learning; Zero-shot learning","Failure analysis; Feature extraction; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Spur gears; Vibration analysis; Dynamics models; Fault severities; Faults detection; Faults diagnosis; Gear diagnose; Health indicators; Intelligent fault diagnosis; Tooth breakage; Traditional approaches; Vibrations analysis; Fault detection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170644744"

Spindle health monitoring is essential to detect wear and cracks in spindle bearings, which can be challenging due to their gradual development and hidden locations. The proposed approach combines physics-based modeling and data-driven techniques to monitor spindle health effectively. In Part I and Part II of the paper, mathematical models of bearing faults and spindle imbalance are integrated into the digital model of the spindle. This allows for simulating the operation of the spindle both with and without faults. The integration of fault models enables the generation of vibrations at sensor locations along the spindle shaft. The generated vibration data from the physics-based model are used to train a recurrent neural network-based (RNN) fault detection algorithm. The RNN learns from the labeled vibration spectra to identify different fault conditions. Bayesian optimization is used to automatically tune the hyperparameters governing the accuracy and efficiency of the learning models during the training process. The RNN classifiers are further fine-tuned using a small set of experimentally collected data for the generalization of the model on real-world data. Once the RNN classifier is trained, it can distinguish between different types of damage and identify their specific locations on the spindle assembly. The proposed algorithms achieved an accuracy of 98.43% on experimental data sets that were not used in training the network. © 2024 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

The correlation fusion of multimodal information is a general law to strengthen the cognition of fault features, and an effective way to improve the reliability and robustness of fault diagnosis methods. However, the physical connotation gaps between multimodal information hinder the construction of correlations, preventing mainstream machine learning (ML) based intelligent diagnosis methods from reliably and effectively taking advantage of multimodal fusion. To address these issues, a physics-inspired multimodal fusion convolutional neural network (PMFN) is proposed in this paper. It is the first attempt to integrate physical knowledge into ML models to bridge physical connotation gaps between multimodal fault information. Specifically, the characterization patterns of rotating machinery fault in multimodal information are embedded in the attention mechanism to focus on representative fault features with physical properties, and generate the universal representation of multimodal information. Furthermore, the cross-modal correlation fusion module is introduced to adaptively construct the correlations of multimodal information, thereby highlighting the unique feature of unimodal information and the shared representation of multimodal information. Finally, the superiority of the proposed fusion method is verified by two cases of industrial gearbox and bearing-rotor system. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Correlations; Fault diagnosis; Information fusion; Multimodal machine learning; Physical knowledge","Convolutional neural networks; Fault detection; Machine learning; Rotating machinery; Correlation; Fault feature; Faults diagnosis; Machine-learning; Machinery fault diagnosis; Multi-modal; Multi-modal fusion; Multi-modal information; Multimodal machine learning; Physical knowledge; Failure analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189556133"

In this paper, we first provide background on the main types of failures that may occur in an electrical power substation after relay algorithms are disabled by malware.

Traditionally, only SCADA signals including nacelle accelerations, rotor speed and electrical power are utilized for this purpose, while drivetrain condition monitoring signals are mainly used for fault detection in gears and bearings. A diagnostic method is proposed using statistical change detection methods for fault detection, phase angle estimation for localizing the faulty blade, and physics-based decision criteria for fault classification. The proposed method is tested in a numerical case study with aeroelastic and drivetrain multi-body models of the 10 MW DTU reference wind turbine. The results suggest that drivetrain condition monitoring signals are particularly beneficial for detecting and diagnosing pitch misalignment, since this fault type uniquely induces periodic out-of-plane bending moments that excite drivetrain bending modes. Drivetrain signals improved the detection rate of a 1° pitch error from 19% to near 100% and reduced the standard error in locating the faulty blade from 71.5° to 11.2°.

Therefore, the developed models are required to be retrained each time the operating condition changes because of the dependence of the dynamic response on them. The lack of effective techniques that can be applied and adapted to different operation domains of the system is a well-established need, which motivates the development of hybrid approaches which integrate both physics and data based techniques. This paper discusses the development of a hybrid physics-informed method that integrates information from physics and data for fault diagnostics of a rotor-bearing system. A physics-based model is used to simulate the dynamics of the system in a defect free condition and a machine fault simulator is used to generate experimental data. Physics-informed features are extracted by residual-based and cross-sample entropy techniques, while the data-based features are obtained using Proper and Smooth Orthogonal Decomposition techniques. Subsequently, these two collections of extracted features are fused into a hybrid feature set. Then, the features are ranked using the Shapley values ranking technique. Comparing the accuracy of classifications upon using the features of physics-informed, data-based and hybrid sets shows improved capability of the proposed framework to generalize diagnostics for various operating conditions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Condition-based maintenance; Cross-sample entropy technique; Diagnostics; Proper orthogonal decomposition technique; Residual analysis; Rigid rotor; Rolling element bearings; Smooth orthogonal decomposition technique; Statistical techniques","Entropy; Fault detection; Pattern recognition; Principal component analysis; Statistical Physics; Condition based maintenance; Cross-sample entropy technique; Diagnostic; Orthogonal decomposition techniques; Proper orthogonal decomposition techniques; Residuals analysis; Rolling Element Bearing; Sample entropy; Smooth orthogonal decomposition; Smooth orthogonal decomposition technique; Statistical techniques; Roller bearings","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164228386"

Although loose connections lead to rising temperatures, traditional steady-state temperature measurement cannot effectively address this issue due to the slow response and susceptibility to ambient temperature. This article presents a temperature rise index (TRI)-based thermal monitoring method for switchgears, aiming for fast detection, straightforward implementation, reliability enhancement, and cost efficiency. To reach that a COMSOL multiphysics simulation with electromagnetic-thermal-fluid coupling has been established for a real plum contact connection configuration. This simulation identifies a criterion that exhibits independence from the ambient temperature variations and enables rapid detection of loose connections within the plum contact. TRI-based thermal monitoring method eliminates the ambient temperature sensors and utilizes only the temperature sensors of the plum contact connections and the current feedback from each phase. The method has been implemented in experiments on a 24 kV switchgear to clarify the feasibility and applicability of the approach. Simulations and experiments confirm TRI's sensitivity to plum contact connection states and electrical current. This agreement validates the simulations and positions TRI as a reliable monitoring tool.

However, this introduces additional uncertainties into the modeling process. Furthermore, practical applications often suffer from insufficient sensor data for specific fault modes, resulting in inaccurate diagnosis results. This article presents a mechanism-informed adversarial transfer learning approach integrated with domain-adversarial neural network (DANN) for turbomachinery fault diagnosis. It aims to enhance the diagnosis accuracy even when only a small amount of sensor data is available. This approach seamlessly integrates physics-embedded axis orbits corresponding to various fault modes in different turbomachines with the DANN model, so-called orbit-based DANN (OrbitDANN). We have developed a generalized procedure to implement this proposed method for automatic fault diagnosis in various turbomachines. Orbit images are generated from both simulated signals and measured sensor data to illustrate the accuracy and feasibility of the proposed model.

Unfortunately, the rise of voltage in low pressure environments brings about a problem with unexpected ionisation phenomena such as arcing. Series arcs in HVDC cannot be detected with conventional means, and finding methods to avoid the potentially catastrophic hazards of these events becomes critical to assure further development of more electric and all electric aviation. Inductive sensors are one of the most promising detectors in terms of sensitivity, cost, weight and adaptability to the circuit wiring in aircraft electric systems. In particular, the solutions based on the detection of the high-frequency (HF) pulses created by the arc have been found to be good candidates in practical applications. This paper proposes a method for designing series arc fault inductive sensors able to capture the aforementioned HF pulses. The methodology relies on modelling the parameters of the sensor based on the physics that intervenes in the HF pulses interaction with the sensor itself. To this end, a comparative analysis with different topologies is carried out. For every approach, the key parameters influencing the HF pulses detection are studied theoretically, modelled with a finite elements method and tested in the laboratory in terms of frequency response. The final validation tests were conducted using the prototypes in real cases of detection of DC series arcs. © 2024 by the authors.","all-electric aircraft; finite elements method; inductive sensors; modelling; more-electric aircraft; series arcs","Aircraft detection; Fault detection; Frequency response; Inductive sensors; More electric aircraft; All-electric aircraft; Arc fault detection; Electrical power; High direct-current; High voltage current; High-frequency pulse; Low pressure environment; Modeling; More electric aircraft; Series arc; aircraft; article; aviation; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; direct current; electric potential; finite element analysis; hypobaric pressure; ionization; sensor; Finite element method","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191358995"

From real-time sensor readings, the values of the model residuals can be calculated, and the posterior probability distributions of the faults can be computed directly using the methods of Bayesian networks. From the posterior distribution of each fault, one can estimate the fault probability based on a chosen threshold and assess the severity of the fault.

Nevertheless, fault signatures at the time of an incipient fault are extremely weak and easily submerged by interference. Currently, signal processing based approaches and machine learning based approaches have been studied for incipient fault detection and diagnosis. However, the former requires relevant technicians with expert knowledge, while the latter needs a substantial volume of labeled samples without model interpretability. In this study, a physics-informed learning framework that integrates weight-based sparse degradation modeling with entropy based indicators is proposed to realize online incipient fault detection and diagnosis. Firstly, based on available normal baseline data and real-time data, a weight-based sparse degradation model is proposed to continually update physics-informed model weights so that weak fault characteristics indicated by learned weights can be considerably enhanced. Meanwhile, this study introduces a family of entropy based indicators for machine health monitoring and their performances are thoroughly investigated based on simulation and experimental studies, which aims to quantify amplified fault characteristics revealed by the continuously updated model weights for online incipient fault detection. Two case studies show that the proposed methodology has better detection ability and sensitivity than classical health indicators for incipient bearing faults. Since the proposed methodology does not demand fault data for model establishment, it is closer to real engineering applications and has more engineering meanings. Moreover, physics-informed model weights can automatically capture informative frequencies for immediate diagnosis and further analysis. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Entropy based indicators; Machine health monitoring; Online incipient fault detection; Physics-informed sparse degradation modeling; Updated model weights","Entropy; Fault detection; Learning systems; Degradation model; Entropy based indicator; Entropy-based; Incipient fault detection; Machine health monitoring; Model weights; Online incipient fault detection; Physic-informed sparse degradation modeling; Updated model; Updated model weight; Signal processing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163132689"

Both DTs are fed by data recorded on a test bench instrumented with sensors of temperature, acceleration and displacement. Rules for fault detection were identified, explained and applied to the two DTs implemented. The two implemented DTs detected abnormal wear behaviours. The data-based DT using the SPC is easier to implement and it detects change in wear behaviour earlier. In contrast, the physic-based DT has the advantage of being predictive, so it can be used when only the operating conditions of the system are known.

Which are quite often associated with intermittent sparks discharges. Since these kinds of hazards are quite difficult to detect in the system, this paper proposes a novel approach which divorces completely with the conventional practices. In other words, this paper presents an alternative approach for the monitoring of the single phase-to-ground faults associated with the power arcing hazards with the aid of radio measurement only. Bearing in mind that although this novel proposed method tries to divorce the conventional faults’ mitigation techniques, it intends to provide a backup solution which could supplement these above-mentioned traditional fault protection schemes. However, referring to the discovery of Marconi, in addition to several physics’ theories namely Faraday’s laws and Maxwell’s differential equations, it is evident nowadays to relate the electric arcing (or sparks discharges) intermittent current path and the electromagnetic energy fields. Based on this evidence this paper introduced a novel method which relies exclusively on the arc fault sparks discharges induced Electromagnetic Radiated energy (EMR) to decide both the detection and the location of these electric arcs. Since under a real field measurement condition, the air-bone signals sensors such as the antennas can detect any kind of Radio Frequency (RF) signals, therefore the main objective of this study consists of evaluating the possible challenges which might emerge during radio measurement. These potential challenges concern the reliability and capability of the antenna’s operation and function. In other words, the fundamental objective consists of providing evidence that during the electric arc radio measurement process these wireless sensors are capturing the arc induced EMR signals waves instead of those radiated by other external sources including the energized power lines for instance. To provide evidence of the antenna potential in clarifying the detection of the power arcing faults EMR from those generated by the external sources, this paper has undergone sophisticate and significant experimental measurements. As a result, it follows that despite the existence of the external noises interference, still the radio measurement of the electric arcs is not only a distinctive, but it is also a promising tool which needs to be further scrutinized to be incorporated in the power system protection field. © 2024 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.-All rights reserved.","D.dot-; Electromagnetic Radiation; Loop-Antennas; Power Arcing Fault; Power Distribution System; Receiver-Antennas; RF-Signal; Transmitter-; Wireless Sensor; Yagi-Uda-","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213511162"

The increased adoption of cyber-physical systems in SM leads to the comprehensive framework of cyber-physical manufacturing systems (CPMS) where data-enabled decision-making mechanisms are coupled with cyber-physical resources on the plant floor. Due to their cyber-physical nature, CPMS are susceptible to cyber-attacks that may cause harm to the manufacturing system, products, or even the human workers involved in this context. Therefore, detecting cyber-attacks efficiently and timely is a crucial step toward implementing and securing high-performance CPMS in practice. This paper addresses two key challenges to CPMS cyber-attack detection. The first challenge is distinguishing expected anomalies in the system from cyber-attacks. The second challenge is the identification of cyber-attacks during the transient response of CPMS due to closed-loop controllers. Digital twin (DT) technology emerges as a promising solution for providing additional insights into the physical process (twin) by leveraging run-time data, models, and analytics. In this work, we propose a DT framework for detecting cyber-attacks in CPMS during controlled transient behavior as well as expected anomalies of the physical process. We present a DT framework and provide details on structuring the architecture to support cyber-attack detection. Additionally, we present an experimental case study on off-the-shelf 3D printers to detect cyber-attacks utilizing the proposed DT framework to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.Note to Practitioners - This work is motivated by developing a general-purpose and extensible digital twin-enabled cyber-attack detection framework for manufacturing systems. Existing works in the field consider specialized attack scenarios and models that may not be extensible in practical manufacturing scenarios. We utilize digital twin (DT) technology as a key enabler to develop a systematic and extensible framework where we identify the abnormality of a resource and detect if the abnormality is due to an attack or an expected anomaly. We provide several remarks on how our proposed framework can extend existing industrial control systems (ICS) and can accommodate further extensions. The presented DTs utilize data-driven machine learning models, physics-based models, and subject matter expert knowledge to perform detection and differentiation tasks in the context of expected anomalies and model-based controllers that control the manufacturing process between multiple setpoints. We utilize a model predictive controller on an off-the-shelf 3D printer to run the process, and stage anomalies and cyber-attacks that are successfully detected by the proposed framework.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Anomaly detection; control systems; cyber-physical systems; cyberattack; data analysis; digital twins; fault detection; intelligent automation; manufacturing automation; model checking; security","Anomaly detection; Computer crime; Control systems; Crime; Cyber attacks; Cyber Physical System; Decision making; Embedded systems; Internet of things; Learning systems; Model checking; Network security; Process control; Transient analysis; Anomaly detection; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-attacks; Cyber-physical systems; Faults detection; Industrial internet of thing; Intelligent automation; Manufacturing; Manufacturing Automation; Models checking; Security; Fault detection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149396876"

Capturing the battery's normal behavior and identifying faults in a fleet operating under dynamic and evolving real-world conditions comes with challenges, including data imbalance, label unavailability, and concept drift. To address these challenges and enhance the robustness of fault detection in evolving environments, we propose an adaptive fleet-based fault detection method. This method comprises two key components. The first component is an OC-aware anomaly detection method, serving as a static model for robust anomaly detection. The second component includes a novel concept drift detection and adaptation mechanism that continuously monitors data distribution and the performance of the anomaly detection model. This mechanism identifies changes in the battery pack's normal behavior under evolving conditions. Our proposed concept drift detection method reduces false alarms and enhances noise robustness by integrating drift detection and drift isolation within a hierarchical structure. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method are validated using real-world in-field data. Note to Practitioners-Existing methods for identifying battery pack faults in electric vehicle (EV) fleets predominantly hinge on static models, deriving from either high-fidelity physics-based battery models or data-driven models trained on extensive labeled datasets. However, the detection performance of static models may degrade when concept drift occurs during real-time fleet monitoring. This paper introduces a novel adaptive fault detection method with an innovative concept drift detection and adaptation mechanism, all without the need for labeled or faulty samples. Furthermore, the method can differentiate real battery faults from concept drift caused by changing operating conditions, significantly reducing false alarms during the model adaptation process. The robustness to unprecedented operating conditions in anomaly detection and the effectiveness of concept detection are validated in case studies using in-field fleet data. In future research, to enhance the efficiency of model retraining and conserve data storage resources, there is a desire to develop an incremental fault detection model that does not require the retention of all historical data.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Concept drift; fault detection; fleet learning; Lithium-ion battery pack; one-class data","Anomaly detection; Battery management systems; Behavioral research; Charging (batteries); Digital storage; Electric vehicles; Errors; Fleet operations; Lithium-ion batteries; Timing circuits; Adaptation models; Anomaly detection; Battery; Battery pack; Behavioral science; Circuit faults; Concept drifts; Faults detection; Fleet learning; Lithium-ion battery pack; One-class data; Fault detection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185388125"

Due to the wide variety of electricity generation methods and associated supporting hardware, utilities choose software that is applicable to the broad category of industrial hardware. As a result, these tools excel at detecting large deviations from normal operation but struggle to identify subtle shifts in performance that are indicative of the onset of degradation and failure. At worst, these tools can be oversensitive and raise false alarms when the deviations are explained by operation outside of what was observed in the tool's training data. Recent developments in physics-based modeling have resulted in models that are capable of accurately detecting faults in the DC collector field that, individually, results in a less than 5% power loss at the combiner box level.

Herein, a hyperdisk that constructs a proper geometric approximation of a dataset is defined as the cross zone between a hypersphere and an affine hull. Firstly, based on sparsity preserving projection, a physics-informed methodology is proposed to extract interpretable projection features for immediate fault diagnosis. Simultaneously, based on extracted low-dimensional features, a hyperdisk based degradation modeling methodology is proposed to construct a HI for initial fault detection. Herein, once a baselined hyperdisk model is constructed, a HI can be efficiently computed by simultaneously considering the projection and relative distances of the baselined hyperdisk model.

The use of data-driven methods for these tasks is limited by the requirement of physically consistent outcomes, particularly in safety-critical systems. Considering the importance of regulating valves (e.g., safety relief valves and main steam isolation valves), this work proposes a multistage Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for fault detection in such components. Two stages of the PINN are built by developing the process model of the regulating valve, which integrates the basic valve sizing equation into the loss function to jointly train the two stages of the PINN. In the 1st stage, a shallow Neural Network (NN) with only one hidden layer is developed to estimate the equivalent flow coefficient (a key performance indicator of regulating valves) using the displacement of the valve as input. In the 2nd stage, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) is developed to estimate the flow rate expected in normal conditions using inputs such as the estimated flow coefficient from the 1st stage, the differential pressure, and the fluid temperature. Then, the residual, i.e., the difference between the estimated and measured flow rates, is fed into a Deep Support Vector Data Description (DeepSVDD) to detect the occurrence of faults. Moreover, the deviation between the estimated flow coefficients of normal and faulty conditions is used to interpret the consistency of the detection result with physics. The proposed method is, first, applied to a simulation case implemented to emulate the operating characteristics of regulating the valves of NPPs and then validated on a real-world case study based on the DAMADICS benchmark. Compared to state-of-the-art fault detection methods, the obtained results from the proposed method show effective fault detection performance and reasonable flow coefficient estimation, thus guaranteeing the physical consistency of the detection results. © 2024 by the authors.","deep neural network; DeepSVDD; fault detection; nuclear power plant; physics-informed neural network; regulating valves","Benchmarking; Condition monitoring; Data description; Fault detection; Multilayer neural networks; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Online systems; Safety valves; Deep support vector data description; Faults detection; Flow coefficients; Multi-stages; Neural-networks; Normal condition; Online condition monitoring; Physic-informed neural network; Regulating valve; Support vector data description; Deep neural networks","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195776201"

On-board diagnostic (OBD) systems must be thoroughly calibrated and validated through many iterations to function effectively and meet the regulation standards. Their development and design process are more complex when prototype hardware is not available and therefore virtual testing is a prominent solution, including Model-in-the-loop (MIL), Software-in-the-loop (SIL) and Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations. Virtual prototype testing relying on real-time simulation models is necessary to design and test new era's OBD systems quickly and in scale. The new fuel cell powertrain involves new and previously unexplored fail modes. To make the system robust, simulations are required to be carried out to identify different fails. Thus, it is imminent to build simulation models which can reliably reproduce failures of components like the compressor, recirculation pump, humidifier, or cooling systems. This paper shows the development of high-fidelity fuel cell model which is used as digital twin to reproduce relevant failure modes. As the OBD regulations become more stringent and advanced, it is difficult to keep pace with it and perform comprehensive testing in real world environment. In such scenarios, MIL, SIL and HIL testing becomes more prevalent. MIL and SIL testing provide a quick way for controls engineers to develop new strategies at system level to adhere to new OBD regulations. On the other hand, simulating high fidelity physics based Real Time plant model on HIL systems, allows the engineers to perform fault insertions tests on the software and leave the lab environment with a certain degree of guarantee that the software would fare well in real world conditions. The model used can reproduce failure modes consistently while staying in real time which in turn can be detected by controls and can take action promptly. The viability of this approach is demonstrated by showing MIL and HIL test results.  © 2024 SAE International.

The proposed controller gains the fault tolerance ability by learning from the behavior of the nominal controller, which integrates a physics-based model with a deep learning model to exploit implicit physical insights during the learning process. The proposed controller enhances the intrinsic interpolative nature of the pure deep learning model, thereby improving fault tolerance for unknown faults. Furthermore, a novel loss function that incorporates the physics-based model is proposed. The loss function assigns different loss terms to the fault-free and the fault datasets, facilitating accurate utilization of loss terms. Unlike traditional active fault-tolerant control schemes, the proposed method requires no explicit fault detection and diagnosis module. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is validated through hardware-in-the-loop simulations. The results indicate that the proposed controller outperforms the pure deep learning controller, as evidenced by a shorter sun-pointing convergence time and more precise angular velocity.  © 2024 IEEE.","Attitude control; fault-tolerant control (FTC); physics-guided neural networks (PGNNs)","Deep learning; Digital storage; Fault-tolerant; Fault-tolerant control; Faults tolerant controls; Learning models; Loss functions; Neural-networks; Physic-guided neural network; Physics-based models; Power supply; System reliability; Hardware-in-the-loop simulation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211495929"

To address sample imbalance, this work explores a novel bearing fault data–generation approach based on digital twin technique. First, an inverse physics–informed neural network (PINN) is built to recognize dynamic model parameters by embedding a bearing dynamic model into a neural network. In this network, a boundary loss is designed to quickly determine the approximate ranges of parameters that can accelerate network convergence, and a true value loss is constructed for the assessment of spectral discrepancy between simulated and actual data. Then, using an inverse PINN, a bearing fault dynamic model, and real vibration data, we propose a digital twin–based fault data–generation method for producing high-quality bearing fault samples under multiple working conditions and fault modes. Finally, the developed approach is applied to generate bearing fault vibration samples under a specific working condition. The samples are used for training the diagnostic network, thus solving the issue of sample imbalance. The comparison results of several experiments suggest that the developed data-generation method effectively improves the precision of cross-working-condition bearing fault diagnosis and surpasses multiple state-of-the-art methods. © 2024","Bearing dynamic model; Digital twin; Fault diagnosis; Physics-informed neural network; Sample imbalance","Dynamics; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Inverse problems; Roller bearings; Bearing dynamic model; Bearing dynamics; Bearing fault; Bearing fault diagnosis; Data generation; Dynamics models; Faults diagnosis; Neural-networks; Physic-informed neural network; Sample imbalance; Dynamic models","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187956310"

Existing empirical and physics-based models provide approximate predictions of the generated power as a function of the wind speed, but face limitations in capturing the non-linear and complex relationships between input variables and output power. Data-driven methods present new avenues for enhancing wind turbine modeling using large datasets, thereby improving accuracy and efficiency. In this study, we use a hybrid semi-parametric model to leverage the strengths of two distinct approaches in a dataset with four turbines of a wind farm. Our model comprises a physics-inspired submodel, which offers a reliable approximation of the power, combined with a non-parametric submodel to predict the residual component. This non-parametric submodel is fed with a broader set of variables, aiming to capture phenomena not addressed by the physics-based part. For explainability purposes, the influence of input features on the output of the residual submodel is analyzed using SHAP values. The proposed hybrid model finally yields a 35–40 % accuracy improvement in the prediction of power generation with respect to the physics-based model. At the same time, the explainability analysis, along with the physics grounding from the parametric submodel, ensure deep understanding of the analyzed problem. In the end, this investigation paves the way for assessing the impact, and thus the potential optimization, of several unmodeled independent variables on the power generated by wind turbines. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Explainable AI; Hybrid semi-parametric models; Wind Turbines","Fault detection; Forecasting; Large datasets; Wind; Wind power; Early fault; Explainable AI; Fault-detection mechanisms; Hybrid semi-parametric model; Nonparametrics; Physics-based models; Power; Semi-parametric modeling; Submodels; Turbine operation; Wind turbines","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199558501"

However, these methods have several limitations: 1) using less labeled data to obtain higher accuracy is a challenging task, which limits the application of diagnostic models in practical applications and 2) physics-informed knowledge is largely ignored during the modeling process, which contains a wealth of information that can reflect the harmonic drive's health status. To address these challenges, a self-supervised fault diagnosis framework is developed by integrating prior knowledge with deep learning to improve the accuracy and reliability of diagnosis models in industrial applications. Specifically, the physics-based knowledge, including 32-D time domain, frequency domain, and time-frequency domain features, is first designed to provide fault information and significantly reduce the amount of data required for deep learning. Furthermore, a self-supervised knowledge embedded autoencoder network is built by employing the prior knowledge in the multiscale convolutional autoencoder. With the ability to integrate prior knowledge and the self-supervised learning mechanism, the proposed method can provide a strong tool for knowledge representation and an effective solution for fault diagnosis under a few-shot industrial scenario.

Such a 3D nonlinear problem can take up to 10 h to solve by performing finite element analysis (FEA), considering the length of the pipeline and a large number of pipe and soil elements. However, the ML and data-driven techniques can learn the projection rule of input-output and predict the pipeline response instantaneously given a set of input features. In addition, the well-trained ML model can be implemented for regional-scale risk and rapid post-event damage assessments. In this study, the input for ML comprised approximately 217K nonlinear FEAs, which covered a wide range of combinations of soil, structural and fault properties and yielded critical pipe strain responses under fault-rupture displacements. We adopted various regression models and physics-constrained neural networks, which can accurately and rapidly predict the tensile and compressive strains for a broad range of probable fault-rupture displacements. Performances of various ML and conventional statistical models were systematically examined. Not surprisingly, neural networks exhibited the best performance for this multi-output regression problem, in which R2 > 0.95 was achieved for a wide range of fault displacement (FD) levels. Further, we used the trained neural network with 14.5 million Monte-Carlo-generated input samples to predict the maximum tensile and compressive strain curves of pipelines.

We use Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) to explain the predictions of the classifier and develop a physics based interpretable classifier. The application focus is the condition monitoring of wind turbine gearboxes under varying load scenarios, in particular turbulent wind conditions. Faults in the rotating components in the gearbox can leave their signature in the vibrations that can be measured by accelerometers. We analyze data stemming from a simulated vibration response of a 5MW multibody wind turbine model in a healthy and damaged scenarios and under different wind conditions. With cyclostationary analysis applied on acquired sensor data, we generate cyclic spectral coherence maps that highlight signatures related to the fault damage and enable its identification. These maps are used to train convolutional neural networks that then identify faults, including those of small magnitude, in test data with a high accuracy. Benchmark test cases inspired by an NREL study are tested and faults successfully detected. © Krishtel eMaging Solutions Private Limited 2023.","Condition monitoring; Cyclostationary; Machine learning; Wind turbines","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150971896"

They are a large investment which yields great returns to productivity and profitability. MTs enable the high throughput manufacturing of high precision components. Given their great importance, and their large cost, it is beneficial to implement asset management (AM) strategies such as condition monitoring, fault detection and predictive maintenance. Implementing these processes and methods can improve reliability and performance of MTs, while extending their lifetime and reducing operating expenses. Digital twins (DT) are an emerging technology within the Industry 4.0 landscape. They represent a connection between a physical system, object, or process and it's virtual representation. DTs can be leveraged for AM implementation in MTs. This work examines the potential benefits of applying DTs to AM, examples in the literature of applying AM methods to MTs using DT, and how advanced AM strategies can be deployed using DT. From examining the literature it was clear that DTs are well suited for AM in MTs. DTs enable improved data collection and processing, modeling and model retention, and historical analysis and trend prediction. DTs have been applied to a variety of application scenarios for MTs such as in cutting tools, spindles, and feed drives. DTs can additionally enable more advanced modeling solutions such as physics informed machine learning which can overcome some issues with traditional data-driven and physics-based modeling strategies. These advanced methods can improve overall AM across the MT's life-cycle and enable effective prognostic health management.  © 2024 IEEE.","asset management; condition monitoring; digital twin; fault detection; machine tool","Investments; Asset Management strategy; Assets management; Condition; Essential equipments; Faults detection; High precision components; High-throughput; Performance; Predictive maintenance; Processing model; Asset management","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202345881"

To deal with the problem, we proposed a hierarchical physics-informed neural network (HPINN) to discover the ordinary differential equation (ODE) of a healthy/faulty rotor system from noise measurements and then assess the machine condition based on the discovered ODE. Specifically, the ODE of a healthy rotor system is first stably identified from noise measurement through HPINN guided by rotor dynamics. Based on the identified healthy ODE, the extra fault terms in the ODE of the faulty rotor system are then sparsely regressed from the predefined library embedded in HPINN. Moreover, with the mathematical terms of discovered fault, the potential fault and the health indicator (HI) are diagnosed and constructed to assess the condition of the rotor system, respectively.

Traditionally, physics-based models and involved signal processing techniques are required to identify and extract the subtle frequency components in current data related to a particular fault. We show that TDA offers an alternative way to extract fault related features, and effectively distinguish data from different fault conditions. We will introduce TDA method and the procedure of extracting topological features from time-domain data, and apply it to induction motor current data measured under different eccentricity fault conditions. We show that while the raw time-domain data are very challenging to distinguish, the extracted topological features from these data are distinct and highly associated with eccentricity fault level. With TDA processed data, we can effectively train machine learning models to predict fault levels with good accuracy, even for new data from eccentricity levels that are not seen in the training data.

Imbalances and shaft bowing in these systems can lead to decreased efficiency and increased vibrations. The early detection and mitigation of a rotor’s faults are essential, and model-based fault identification has gained much attention in the manufacturing industry over the years. Over the past two decades, however, the development of fault diagnosis rules with data-driven and artificial intelligence (AI) methods has become a trend, and in the foreseeable future the combination of AI with big data will become mainstream. Nevertheless, the critical role of rotating machinery in manufacturing introduces a challenge, as often insufficient fault data are available. This limitation renders the establishment of diagnostic rules using data-driven methods and AI technologies impractical. In light of these challenges, this study proposes a novel hybrid approach that combines a physical model with machine learning (ML) techniques for the diagnosis of multi-faults (imbalances and shaft bowing are demonstrated) in a Jeffcott rotor. To overcome the lack of real-world labeled fault datasets, a physics-based Jeffcott rotor model is first derived and then used to generate abundant fault datasets for ML. Subsequently, simulated data are employed for the training of an artificial neural network (ANN), enabling the network to learn from and analyze the vast array of generated data. The results prove that a well-trained feed-forward neural network (FNN) can accurately isolate and diagnose imbalance and shaft bowing faults using the simulated and real data from the Jeffcott rotor experiment. These physics-based and ML approaches prove effective particularly for multi-faults, offering new possibilities for advanced rotor system monitoring and maintenance strategies in industrial applications. © 2024 by the authors.","ANN; hybrid approach; imbalance and bow; machine learning; multi-fault diagnosis","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192437699"

In this paper, a new data fusion method based on physics-constrained dictionary learning is proposed to improve the efficiency of data collection and the accuracy of fault diagnosis. In the proposed dictionary learning method, the measurement, basis, and classification matrices are optimized for the effective use of compressed sensing technique in process monitoring. With the optimized matrices, full-scale high-resolution signals can be reconstructed from a small number of sensor measurements. At the same time, machine states can be identified based on the sparse measurements. An adaptive weight scheme is introduced to combine low-cost sensor data so that the accuracy of fault diagnosis can be improved. The proposed method is tested with an experimental dataset of gearbox vibrations caused by gear cracks and different levels of crack severities are classified. The results show that up to 70% of data collection can be saved with the new approach while more than 95% of diagnosis accuracy is achieved.

From the perspective of geological exploration requirements，this paper proposes the development trend and key research directions of deep and ultra-deep carbonate reservoir and fluid prediction technology，so as to provide a reference for the theoretical and technical research of marine carbonate rock seismic exploration，and the following understandings are obtained：① For ultra-deep seismic data with low signal-to-noise ratios，Qstack depth migration and TTI medium RTM technology have achieved certain results in carbonate reservoir imaging. The key research directions include interlayer multi-wave suppression based on wave theory，anisotropic QRTM，least squares QRTM，and anisotropic omnidirectional angle domain imaging technology. ② The seismic data-based prediction technology of deep and ultra-deep heterogeneous carbonate reservoirs has the problems of weak theoretical methods and low prediction accuracy，so it is urgent to strengthen the exploration of theoretical methods and technical breakthroughs. ③ The deep integration of seismic petrophysical experiment and reservoir geology，the refined seismic data-based prediction technology of sensitive reservoir properties based on the wave characteristics of two-phase media（frequency，dispersion，and attenuation），artificially intelligent and quantitative prediction of carbonate reservoirs，and fluid detection technology are important development directions.

A physics-based observer that combines an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) with a Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) has been employed to address two major failure modes in FCEV stacks: flooding and reduction of Electrochemical Active Surface Area (ECSA). Furthermore, the observer estimates the hidden states of a standard automotive airpath system to enable state-feedback control. Therefore, the proposed observer is a novel approach which holistically tackles three coupled problems (i.e., flooding, ECSA loss, and airpath state estimation) which are typically addressed individually. Additionally, the observer is computationally affordable and relies solely on typical vehicle sensors.

Therefore, hydrogen-fueled gas turbines are susceptible to health degradation in the form of steam-induced corrosion and erosion in the hot gas path. In this context, the fault diagnosis of hydrogen-fueled gas turbines becomes indispensable. To the authors’ knowledge, there is a scarcity of fault diagnosis studies for retrofitted gas turbines considering hydrogen as a potential fuel. The present study, however, develops an artificial neural network (ANN)-based fault diagnosis model using the MATLAB environment. Prior to the fault detection, isolation, and identification modules, physics-based performance data of a 100 kW micro gas turbine (MGT) were synthesized using the GasTurb tool. An ANN-based classification algorithm showed a 96.2% classification accuracy for the fault detection and isolation. Moreover, the feedforward neural network-based regression algorithm showed quite good training, testing, and validation accuracies in terms of the root mean square error (RMSE). The study revealed that the presence of hydrogen-induced corrosion faults (both as a single corrosion fault or as simultaneous fouling and corrosion) led to false alarms, thereby prompting other incorrect faults during the fault detection and isolation modules. Additionally, the performance of the fault identification module for the hydrogen fuel scenario was found to be marginally lower than that of the natural gas case due to assumption of small magnitudes of faults arising from hydrogen-induced corrosion. © 2024 by the authors.","diagnostics; fault detection; health degradation; hydrogen fuel; micro gas turbines; steam-induced corrosion","Combustion; Failure analysis; Feedforward neural networks; Gas turbines; Gases; Hydrogen; Hydrogen fuels; Mean square error; Specific heat; Diagnostic; Fault identifications; Faults detection; Faults diagnosis; Health degradation; Hydrogen-fuelled; Micro gas turbine; Micro-gas; Network-based; Steam-induced corrosion; Fault detection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184656336"

Overall, developing a robust and efficient fault diagnostic battery model that aligns with the current literature is an essential step in ensuring the safety of battery function. For this purpose, a multi-physics, multi-scale deterministic data-driven prognosis (DDP) is proposed that only relies on in situ measurements of data and estimates the failure based on the curvature information extracted from the system. Unlike traditional applications that require explicit expression of conservation principle to represent the system's behavior, the proposed method devices a local conservation functional in the neighborhood of each data point which is represented as the minimization of curvature in the system. Pursuing such a deterministic approach, DDP eliminates the need for offline training regimen by considering only two consecutive time instances to make the prognostication that are sufficient to extract the behavioral pattern of the system. The developed framework is then employed to analyze the health of lithium ion batteries by monitoring the performance and detecting faults within the system's behavior. Based on the outcomes, the DDP exhibits promising results in detection of anomaly and prognostication of batteries' failure. © 2023 The Author(s)","Data-driven; Deterministic method; Instability; Lithium-ion battery; Prognostication","Battery management systems; Ions; Data driven; Deterministic methods; Failure detection; Failures prediction; Faults diagnostics; Predictive models; Prognostic and health management; Prognostication; System behaviors; System framework; Lithium-ion batteries","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162182634"

However, it is still a challenging task due to the complexity, uncertainty and time-varying characteristics of limited known fault development and propagation mechanism. Therefore, this paper proposed a physics-guided, data-refined FRCT framework. First, a physics-guided hierarchical fault root cause tracing network (HFTN) model is defined and constructed based on the statistics fault mechanism while considering fault development and propagation characteristics including network, hierarchy, and uncertainty. Second, an operation data-refined algorithm is designed to update the initial model, where Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network and Long Short-Term Memory-based local anomalies detection, and statistical failure laws-based global dynamic fault mechanism reflection are introduced. Third, a novel bidirectional probabilistic reasoning strategy is developed to rank the real-time probabilities of fault causes in HFTN, which combines both faults reverse diagnostic and forward predictive knowledge to improve the results stability.

The breakdown of equipment is costly due to replacement expenses and may cause a facility to shut down, leading to higher costs and production losses. Hence, equipment maintenance is essential to ensure a satisfactory level of reliability during its lifecycle. Maintenance strategies may adopt a reactive approach, in which maintenance happens after failure and should be avoided, or a preventive approach, in which maintenance happens regardless of the state of the system. This work aims at addressing the challenges posed by system deterioration and costly downtime through the development and implementation of a condition monitoring solution for a centrifugal compressor situated in an offshore platform. To achieve this objective, a comprehensive methodology was developed containing two modules: fault detection and prognostics. In the fault detection module, a hybrid approach was adopted by combining measured and simulated data generated using physics-based models, where a machine learning model is trained to detect anomalies and generate alarms. In the prognostics module, a degradation state variable is introduced to predict the time to failure of the centrifugal compressor. By leveraging process simulation to construct a physics-based model, the system can track changes in design polytropic efficiency using real-time sensor data to make predictions of time to failure using a Kalman filter algorithm. We demonstrate the methodology through examples using actual centrifugal compressor measurements collected from Valhall public industrial data. The fully automated solution provides real-time insights on the operational state of the centrifugal compressor, enabling proactive maintenance strategies. The analysis of centrifugal compressor sensor data is streamlined to detect anomalies and trigger alarms for different sensors, enabling prediction of time to failure within a few days before the compressor shutdown happens. The approach presented in this work integrates the strengths of both physics-based and data-driven methods. The methodology exploits the alarm generation and complements it with a time-to-failure prediction using a Kalman filter algorithm. The presented solution contains a real-world application of machine learning in condition monitoring and has the potential to enhance predictive maintenance planning and prevent costs associated with downtime.

Once the insulation failure occurs, it will threaten the normal and safe operation of the motor system. Most existing research mainly focuses on the electrical failure characteristics of motor insulation while ignoring the mechanical failure and coupled stress. In this article, the fatigue propagation and mechanical failure behavior of large motor stator insulation under coupled magnetic-thermal-mechanical stress are investigated by employing fracture theory and numerical methods. First, the uneven distributions of leakage magnetic flux density, winding loss, temperature rise, and dynamic electromagnetic force around the stator end region are analyzed and coupled by using the 3-D finite element (FE) method. Furthermore, the states of coupled stress in the insulation layer are determined by calculating transient electromagnetic field, thermal field, and structural field, where the weak points for concentration stress may be found. Second, the crack defect model mounted in the insulation layer is defined and simulated by using a semi-elliptical element and an arbitrary crack element, respectively. Also, the stress intensity factor (SIF) is introduced to quantitatively describe the fracture behavior and propagation degree of insulation crack failure. Third, the fatigue growth rate of crack under periodic coupling stress is calculated and analyzed according to the Paris equation. In the end, the influence of initial crack with different positions and directions on crack propagation is considered. The results in this study may be helpful to understand the fracture behavior and fatigue propagation characteristics of insulation crack failure under actual operation conditions and provide the theoretical reference for insulation damage evolution, insulation fault diagnosis, and residual life prediction of large motors.  © 1994-2012 IEEE.","Crack defect; fatigue propagation; finite element (FE) method; fracture analysis; large traction motor; multiphysics coupling; winding insulation","Crack detection; Crack propagation; Electromagnetic fields; Failure analysis; Fatigue damage; Fault detection; Fracture; Numerical methods; Stators; Thermal insulation; Traction motors; Winding; Crack defects; Crack failure; Fatigue propagation; Fracture analysis; Large traction motor; Multi-physics couplings; Propagation characteristics; Stator end-winding; Stator winding; Winding insulation; Finite element method","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184795795"

Initially, an enhanced wavelet basis function is designed, in which a scale smoothing factor is defined to acquire more rational wavelet scales. Next, a plug-and-play wavelet weight initialization for deep neural networks is proposed, which utilizes physics-informed wavelet prior knowledge and showcases stronger applicability.

Due to extreme fast-charging, huge application sizes and variable usage environment, the risk of soft battery faults, including soft internal short circuit (SISC), is increased and may evolve into severe accidents. Therefore, accurate early detection of lithium-ion battery fault is imperative to guarantee the battery performance. Motivated by this fact, we proposed a real time fault detection framework for battery soft faults. Based on the Equivalent Circuit Model (ECM) and coupling thermal model, Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) observer is used for reliable monitoring of battery voltage and surface temperature.

Furthermore, the memory characteristics of BiLSTMNN are considered to improve the robustness of the detection system, including comprehensive training data and optimized input features.

The self-supervised framework dynamically updates parameters of underlying model, allowing it to adapt to non-stationarity. AID interprets anomalies as significant deviations from conditional probability, encompassing interactions as well as both spatial and temporal irregularities by exposing them as features. Crucially, AID provides dynamic operating limits to integrate with existing alarm handling mechanisms in SCADA-based IoT systems. Two industrial-scale case studies demonstrate AID's capabilities.

Biologically inspired neuromorphic event cameras are emerging as a powerful alternative to frame-based cameras, due to their ability to asynchronously detect varying intensities (even in poor lighting conditions), high dynamic range, and robustness to motion blur. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained traction for processing events asynchronously in an energy-efficient manner. On the other hand, physics-based artificial intelligence (AI) has gained prominence recently, as they enable embedding system knowledge via physical modeling inside traditional analog neural networks (ANNs). In this letter, we present an event-based physics-guided neuromorphic planner (EV-Planner) to perform obstacle avoidance using neuromorphic event cameras and physics-based AI. We consider the task of autonomous drone navigation where the mission is to detect moving gates and fly through them while avoiding a collision. We use event cameras to perform object detection using a shallow spiking neural network in an unsupervised fashion. Utilizing the physical equations of the brushless DC motors present in the drone rotors, we train a lightweight energy-aware physics-guided neural network (PgNN) with depth inputs. This predicts the optimal flight time responsible for generating near-minimum energy paths. We spawn the drone in the Gazebo simulator and implement a sensor-fused vision-to-planning neuro-symbolic framework using Robot Operating System (ROS).

In the scope of rotor fault diagnosis, existing methods mainly focus on fault identification, which only aims to distinguish between different fault patterns, such as unbalance, misalignment, rub-impact, and so forth. In contrast, much less attention has been paid to isolating the specific axial position of a certain fault, while accurate axial isolation can spare engineers from unnecessary disassembly and save operating costs. The challenge of axially localizing faulty modules involves the powerful mapping capability and the consistency in rotordynamic mechanisms, the latter ensuring the generalization ability. In this paper, the frequency response function (FRF) of a rotor-bearing system is typically chosen to inform the training of the convolution neural network (CNN). Results show that the proposed PICNN can manage to both isolate the faulty disk and estimate the unbalance amplitude, while the neural network entailed contains only 12 layers in total. In the case where the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio is high, the relative error between the exact unbalance amplitude and the estimated one using PICNN is only 0.45%, while the figure is 3.1% even when the SNR reaches 10dB. Compared to the pure black-box model, the PICNN proposed in this paper can save 99.6% of learnable parameters and output effective results by taking 6.6% of the training time involved in the pure black-box model. © 2024 Proceedings of the International Congress on Sound and Vibration.

In this regard, this paper proposes an interpretable chiller fault diagnosis method based on physics-guided neural networks. Through a comprehensive analysis of the chiller's working process and fault evolution, a key physical indicator related to the condenser fouling fault is derived. Then a corresponding physical inconsistency loss function is developed to construct a condenser fouling fault-oriented diagnostic model.

The Department of Engineering of the University of Ferrara has carried out an extensive experimental campaign to record the evolution of vibration signals throughout the life of self-aligning double row rolling element bearings. Six accelerated run-to-failure tests were performed, while the acceleration signals were continuously recorded by a uniaxial accelerometer. A radial load was applied to the bearing housing and controlled by a load cell. The shaft speed was kept constant and controlled by an electric motor driven by an inverter. The data set provided contains acceleration signals in the radial direction for the entire duration of the tests and can be used for research or industrial purposes. © 2024 The Author(s)","Accelerated test; Accelerometer; Diagnostics; Predictive maintenance; Prognostics; Remaining useful life; Rotating machines; RUL","Acceleration; Ball bearings; Fault detection; Industrial research; Maintenance; Roller bearings; Statistical tests; Accelerated tests; Diagnostic; Double rows; Predictive maintenance; Prognostic; Remaining useful lives; Rotating machine; Run to failures; Self-aligning; Accelerometers","Data paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197062070"

Causality analysis is often used to construct causal maps and obtain a sequence of fault propagation for an in-depth investigation. The reliability of the widely used Granger causality depends on the quality of the observed data. But since real-world industrial data are prone to sensor errors, their accuracy is significantly compromised. Experienced engineers possess years of valuable process knowledge which when introduced into the modeling can significantly reduce the over-dependence on data. In this article, we propose a novel approach to efficiently amalgamate expert information with the observed data to reconstruct causal maps. A new surrogate-data-based approach to test the significance of the causal relations obtained for oscillatory data is also proposed in this article.

However, the machine stator groundwall and/or turn insulation are prone to failure suffering the inverter’s high dv/dt. It is necessary to identify them as early as possible but challenging due to their coupled and weak symptoms. In this article, a hybrid physics-based and data-driven approach is proposed to monitor insulation degradations. First, the physical mechanism analysis is carried out to obtain high-quality data sensitive to stator insulation conditions, i.e., the high-frequency common-mode switching oscillations. Then, the continuous wavelet transform is used to extract the time-frequency features of switching oscillations. Finally, an improved convolutional neural network is designed for the groundwall and/or turn insulation faults diagnosis.

Also, multi-source domain adaptation-based FD methods have achieved more widely acclaimed performance than the single-source domain. However, these methods try to derive domain-invariant features for multiple sources but ignore the semantic information of the target data under multi-source domain adaptation. In addition, aligning the decision boundaries of different classifiers may lead to the confusion of margin features, thus resulting in a limitation. To overcome these challenges, a two-stage transfer alignment (TSTA) method is proposed to complete fault diagnosis of bearings under transfer tasks. Specifically, a novel temporal transformer is developed as a backbone network to extract common and domain-specific fault features at different stages, where the common feature extractor can further reduce the complexity of the model. Meanwhile, a semantic consistency module is designed to consider the target semantics while eliminating the discrepancies in each pair of source and target domains, thus preserving the target information. Also, an entropy loss is developed to eliminate feature confusion in aligning domain-specific decision boundaries of different classifiers. Two bearing cases are extensively evaluated to validate the superiority of TSTA. The experiment results show that TSTA exhibits more competitive outcomes. In future work, a framework will be explored to treat physics-based domain knowledge as a soft constraint to penalize the loss function of deep neural networks. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Fault diagnosis; Health monitoring; Rotating machinery; Transfer learning; Varying working condition","Deep neural networks; Entropy; Fault detection; Finite difference method; Industrial research; Semantics; Decision boundary; Domain adaptation; Entropy loss; Faults diagnosis; Health monitoring; Multi-Sources; Semantic consistency; Transfer alignment; Transfer learning; Varying working conditions; Failure analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85154540103"

In such systems, it becomes critically important to forewarn about the impending faults that have developed in the components to ensure robust and safe operation. Faults that develop in rotating machinery are notoriously difficult to detect using conventional methods. These faults can exacerbate very quickly, which can cause irreparable damage, financial loss and potential casualties. Thus, development of robust techniques for damage detection is imperative for improving safety and reliability of machinery. These techniques use signals from widely deployed sensors, and once validated, can be used for continuous monitoring of the machinery systems, thereby aiding further automation. In this paper, we have developed a technique wherein Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) is used in conjunction with Machine Learning to predict the degradation of a crack in a rotating shaft. Recurrence is a phenomenon that is widely exhibited in many nonlinear processes, and recurrence plot is a two-dimensional visualization of the higher dimensional dynamical systems and helps to understand the recurrence of states in phase space. RQA is an objective and quantitative method to analyze recurrence plots and yields features of the dynamical systems which we employ in conjunction with appropriate Machine Learning algorithms in order to develop a robust diagnostics algorithm. To obtain the dynamic response of the system for various fault conditions, a physics-based model of the cracked rotors is used, and in order to map the RQA features to fault space, a multi-layer perceptron neural network is used. The results of this study demonstrate that RQA has outstanding performance in crack depth estimation with minimal need for expert knowledge about the dynamic response of the system. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.","Condition monitoring; Crack depth estimation; Machine learning; Recurrence quantification analysis","Condition monitoring; Cracks; Damage detection; Dynamical systems; Failure (mechanical); Learning algorithms; Losses; Multilayer neural networks; Network layers; Recurrent neural networks; Rotating machinery; Conventional methods; Crack depth estimation; Financial loss; Machine-learning; Recurrence plot; Recurrence quantification analysis; Robust operation; Robust technique; Rotor cracks; Safe operation; Dynamic response","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190260126"

Studying the similarities and complementarities between the two types of signals can effectively improve the accuracy of fault identification. Fault diagnosis methods incorporating domain knowledge can significantly enhance the recognition precision and efficiency of models in tasks with limited samples. Therefore, a two-stage fusion-based fault diagnosis framework has been developed based on the characteristics of acoustic and vibration signals. First, according to the respective signal characteristics, multiscale multilayer perceptron models were constructed to fuse the physical features of vibration and acoustic signals separately. Then, a second-level fusion model was established based on Dempster-Shafer evidence theory, realizing the joint operation of the acoustic-vibration system. This proposed model had been validated on a bogie fault simulation test dataset, achieving an identification accuracy of over 95% even in experiments with small sample sizes. Compared to other methods, this approach demonstrated its effectiveness and feasibility. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Fault diagnosis; psychoacoustics; sound and vibration signal fusion; train operation safety","Fault detection; Acoustic signals; Bearing fault diagnosis; Faults diagnosis; Operation safety; Signal fusions; Sound and vibration signal fusion; Sound signal; Train operation safety; Train operations; Vibration signal; Bogies (railroad rolling stock)","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206214357"

Fault classification is implemented using a data-driven method to distinguish the underlying patterns, which is difficult to achieve by conventional threshold limit checking due to the inevitably introduced noise and uncertainties.

Physics-guided sample generation emerges as a promising remedy for addressing the scarcity of labeled samples during model training. However, existing studies have tended to overlook the coupling effect between the marginal and conditional distributions of physical and real samples, leading to domain confusion and a subsequent reduction in model generalization and diagnostic accuracy. Therefore, this study introduces a novel approach: the physically driven sample-based domain distribution alignment discriminative network (DDADN), which integrates dynamic modeling and domain adaptation. Specifically, a lumped parameter model is established to generate complete defect samples, subsequently optimized using the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). Next, an enhanced joint distribution adaptation (EJDA) mechanism is employed to harmonize distributions across domains, effectively aligning both overall and class-specific distributions within the domains and thus achieving adaptive domain confusion. Meanwhile, to ensure robust feature classification and extraction, an adaptive softmax (A-softmax) loss function is introduced. Finally, in unlabeled real operating conditions, the proposed multitask scheme adeptly transfers knowledge between physical and real signals, yielding impressive classification accuracies of 97.78% and 98.34% for the experimental and Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) datasets, respectively.

In this regard, hydrogen is envisioned as a long-term alternative fuel for gas turbines. Accordingly, the gas turbine industry has expedited their efforts in developing 100% hydrogen compliant burners and associated auxiliary components for retrofitting the existing gas turbines. The utilization of hydrogen in gas turbines has some underlying challenges such as corrosion mainly originating from increased steam content in the hot gas path. In addition to corrosion, the gas turbine compressor is vulnerable to fouling which is the most commonly occurring fault in gas turbine operating over certain time window. Both faults are susceptible to performance and health degradation. To avoid expensive asset loss caused by unexpected downtimes and shutdowns, timely maintenance decision making is required. Therefore, simple, accurate and computationally efficient fault detection and diagnostics models become crucial for timely assessment of health status of the gas turbines. The present study encompassed development of a physics-based performance model of a 100-kWe micro gas turbine running on 100% hydrogen fuel. The model is validated with experimental data acquired from test campaigns at the University of Stavanger. Data synthesized from experimentally validated performance model are utilized further for training machine learning algorithms. To identify an accurate algorithm, various algorithms such as support vector machine, decision tree, random forest algorithm, k-nearest neighbors, and artificial neural network were tested. The findings from fault diagnostics process (classification) revealed that ANN outperformed its counterpart algorithm by giving accuracy of 94.55%. Similarly, ANN also showed higher accuracy in performance degradation estimation process (regression) by showing the MSE of training loss as low as ~0.14. The comparative analysis of all the chosen algorithms in the present study revealed ANN as the most accurate algorithm for fault diagnostics of hydrogen fueled gas turbines. However, there is need to further implement the ensemble machine learning models or deep learning model to explore and expedite the real time fault diagnostic accuracy to avoid false alarms and missed detections in context of hydrogen fuel. © 2024 by ASME.","fault detection; gas path diagnostics; hydrogen fuel; Micro gas turbine; performance degradation estimation","Analog storage; Antiknock compounds; Coal; Digital storage; Fault tree analysis; Gas compressors; Hydrogen fuels; Magnetic couplings; Nearest neighbor search; Nonmetallic bearings; Support vector machines; Turbine components; Comparative analyzes; Faults detection; Faults diagnostics; Gas path; Gas path diagnostic; Hydrogen-fuelled; Micro gas turbine; Micro-gas; Performance degradation; Performance degradation estimation; Gas turbines","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204292969"

This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive and systematic literature review on fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) methods for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. This review covers the period from 2013 to 2023 to identify and analyze the existing research in this field. Our work concentrates explicitly on synthesizing AI-based FDD techniques, particularly summarizing these methods and offering a comprehensive classification. First, we discuss the challenges while developing FDD methods for HVAC systems. Next, we classify AI-based FDD methods into three categories: those based on traditional machine learning, deep learning, and hybrid AI models. Additionally, we also examine physical model-based methods to compare them with AI-based methods. The analysis concludes that AI-based HVAC FDD, despite its higher accuracy and reduced reliance on expert knowledge, has garnered considerable research interest compared to physics-based methods. However, it still encounters difficulties in dynamic and time-varying environments and achieving FDD resolution. Addressing these challenges is essential to facilitate the widespread adoption of AI-based FDD in HVAC. © 2024 The Authors","AI-Based methods; And air conditioning (HVAC); Building energy systems; Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD); Heating; Physical model-based methods; Systematic review; Ventilation","Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; And air conditioning (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning); Artificial intelligence-based method; Building energy systems; Fault detection and diagnose; Fault detection and diagnosis; Heating ventilation and air conditioning; Model-based method; Physical model-based method; Physical modelling; Systematic Review; Air conditioning","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186082181"

The core of smart management is the development of reference models for target energy device. However, existing reference models show poor extrapolation ability when the operation conditions of online data are outside the scope of training data. To tackle this problem, here we propose a novel physics-constrained cooperative learning framework to train multiple reference models in a cooperative manner in order to improve their extrapolation ability. The general idea of cooperative learning is to constrain the output of different reference models on unknown operation conditions such that the physical inconsistent loss is minimized. In this study, two novel physical inconsistent losses, including energy conservation inconsistent loss and mass conservation inconsistent loss, are designed for seven output reference variables of chiller, forming the physics-constrained cooperative neural networks (PCNNs). Comprehensive data experiments are conducted to compare the model performance of PCNNs with other machine learning models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The experimental results showed that the PCNNs outperformed the other models under extrapolation scenarios, showing a lager performance improvement of mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) metrics with 26.94% and 23.49%, respectively.

We have access to data streamed from a pressure sensor located in the air tanks of a few city buses, during their daily operations. The air tank in these buses supplies compressed air to drive various components, e.g. air brake, suspension, doors, gearbox, etc. We fitted three physics-based models only to the leakage segments extracted from the air pressure signal and used fitted model parameters as expert features for detecting air leaks. Furthermore, statistical moments of these fitted parameters, over predetermined time intervals, were compared to conventional statistical features on raw pressure values, under a classification setting in discriminating samples before and after the repair of air leak problems. The result of this exploratory study, on six air leak cases, shows that the fitted parameters of the physics-based models are useful for discriminating samples with air leak faults from the fault-free samples, which were observed right after the repair was performed to deal with the air leak problem. The comparison based on ANOVA F-score shows that the proposed features based on fitted parameters of physics-based models outrank the conventional features.

The physics-based model includes sensors embedded in the real system and virtual sensors to represent the behaviour of the system when a failure mode (FM) is simulated. This fusion leads to improved maintenance actions to reduce the number of failures and predict the behaviour of the system. HyM can lead to improved fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) processes of critical systems, but multiple fault detection models are sometimes inaccurate.

The energy efficiency, product yield, and maintenance of the precision machine require a digital twin that can assist with prognostics and health management. Here, a physics-based model is developed and validated against face milling data, and then used for the timely and precise inference of machining faults that cannot be measured directly. Computer numerical control (CNC) measurements of power and force are used through this physics-based machining model to predict deviations of the outputs of power consumption and cutting forces during normal operation. A model-based fault detection and isolation methodology is applied to determine the optimal (traditional and available) sensor suite and the test settings (admissible input values) that improve the inference of tool wear in face milling. The optimal sensor suite and input test settings are obtained by solving a mixed integer non-linear program that optimizes information-theoretic metrics relevant to the detection and isolation of tool wear from steady-state or transient machining measurements.

Existing fault diagnosis methods can be generally classified into signal processing-based fault characteristic frequency (FCF) identification methods and machine learning-based model classification methods. Though the former owns clear physical meaning, its integration with monitoring data for automatically optimizing square envelope spectrum for identification of FCF is not fully explored. As for the latter, lacking explicit interpretability of learned model weights limits its wide applications. In this paper, to address these critical issues, the integration of online monitoring data with cyclostationarity of fault transients is sufficiently studied and utilized to construct a fault cyclostationarity-based convex optimization model. The maximum logarithmic likelihood estimation is then used to solve the convex optimization model. Moreover, an online weight updating algorithm is developed to relieve the requirement of historical data and to make the weight updating of the proposed optimization model adaptive to online monitoring data. Subsequently, interpretable online updated weights as an optimized square envelope spectrum (OSES) are proposed to enhance the identification of FCF and its harmonics in the OSES. And a three-dimensional (3D) OSES and a detector with an alarming threshold are designed to eliminate the need for label information and further to simultaneously achieve incipient fault time detection, fault type diagnosis, and online fault evolution monitoring. A practical-project bearing dataset and two experimental bearing run-to-failure datasets are used to validate the effectiveness and superiority of interpretable online updated weights as the OSES and 3D OSES. Results demonstrate that the integration of fault characteristics with machine learning theory (e.g., convex optimization) is a new promising physics-informed perspective to monitor and diagnose machine faults. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Convex optimization; Fault characteristic frequency; Machine condition monitoring; Physics-informed; Square envelope spectrum","Condition monitoring; Convex optimization; Data integration; Failure analysis; Integration; Machine learning; Signal processing; Characteristic-frequency; Condition monitoring and faults diagnosis; Convex optimisation; Envelope spectra; Fault characteristic frequency; Fault characteristics; Machine condition monitoring; Optimization models; Physic-informed; Square envelope spectrum; Fault detection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122217356"

One crucial feature of the desired monitoring tool is the capability to detect and discriminate sensor faults from component faults. When a component fault occurs, certain control actions are required to mitigate the effects. A sensor fault misdiagnosed as a component fault or gone undetected may lead to wrong control actions whose consequences could be detrimental to the underlying process. Furthermore, the presence of measurement and modeling uncertainty necessitates a probabilistic approach. To ensure these capabilities, a method using physics-based models for fault detection and statistical inference methods for automated reasoning was developed and implemented in the code PRO-AID. Physics-based diagnostic models were developed for the major components in a thermal energy storage circuit, i.e., the intermediate heat exchanger, the storage tanks, and the control valves. High-fidelity simulations of the system during fault-free operation, and a faulty scenario (i.e., a control valve stuck fault during operation followed by fouling in the heat exchanger), were performed to provide training and test data. Noise was added to the sensor readings to represent measurement uncertainties. Both faults were correctly detected and diagnosed. A graphical user interface prototype was developed to demonstrate how the diagnostic results and the performed control actions can be effectively displayed to the plant operators. © 2023 American Nuclear Society, Incorporated.","Autonomous Operation; Digital Twin; Fault Diagnosis; Health Monitoring","Fault detection; Graphical user interfaces; Heat exchangers; Heat storage; Statistical Physics; Uncertainty analysis; Advanced reactors; Autonomous operations; Component faults; Control actions; Control valves; Diagnostic methods; Faults diagnosis; Health monitoring; Measurement uncertainty; Sensors faults; Digital storage","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183324413"

But the increasing amount of data, generated by sensors, offers a solution: Machine Learning (ML) can be used to automatically generate models for Anomaly Detection and diagnosis based on data — at least in addition to manual models. While nowadays huge data sets for CPPS exist, they mainly cover repetitive OK situations and lack fault modes, which is problematic for the training of ML algorithms. In this work we present a possibility to overcome this problem by generating data with a simulation of modular CPPS. For simulation we use the game engine Unity, which has already been employed to generate data for the training of self-driving cars and the simulation of robots. Within Unity, modules of CPPS are designed and programmed. Afterwards they are combined into complex CPPS, which are then used for simulation using the built-in physics engine of Unity. The built-in physics engine is not constrained to certain applications, but can adequately simulate a wide variety of scenarios, allowing for the combination of different simulation types. The generated data can be exported for training purposes. In the simulation, faults can be inserted and data sets containing faults and normal behavior can be exported. This way, ML algorithms can be trained for fault detection and diagnosis. The data is especially useful for pre-training of ML algorithms, which can later be fine-tuned using data sets from the real CPPS. This way, the problem of repetitive data sets which lack data for fault cases can be overcome. Furthermore, the simulation can be utilized as a test environment for newly developed ML algorithm before they are employed in real systems. © 2022 Prognostics and Health Management Society.

Many malfunctions and faults can occur to the marine engine and efficient condition monitoring is critical to ensure the expected performance. In this paper, a marine engine test rig is established and its process data are recorded, including various temperatures and pressures. Two data-driven models, i.e., principal component analysis and the sparse autoencoder, and a physics-based model are applied to the marine engine for two classic faults, i.e., lubrication oil filter blocking and cylinder leakage. Comparative studies and discussions are conducted regarding their performance in terms of anomaly detection and fault isolation. The data points collected for the filter blocking fault are generally two times higher than the fault thresholds set by the data-driven models. In the physics-based model, it is observed that the lubrication oil pressure falls from the predicted 3.2–3.8 bar to around 2.3 bar. For the cylinder leakage fault, the fault test data are nearly four times higher than the thresholds in the data-driven models. The exhaust gas temperature of the leaked cylinder falls from an estimated 150–200 °C to about 100 °C. The transferability and interpretability of these models are finally discussed. The findings of the present study offer insights into the two types of models and can provide guidance for the effective condition monitoring of marine engines. © 2023 by the authors.","data-driven model; health monitoring; marine engine; physics-based; rotating machines","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160557774"

In the ECPS, though the high-level cyber-physical interaction and integration increase the flexibility and efficiency of power system operation, the accompanied cyber perils gradually endanger the system security. In fact, several energy sector-targeted attacks, including the infamous Ukraine power grid hack, have shown the power system vulnerability in cybersecurity incidents. Known as the critical power-balancing operation in real-time control systems, automatic generation control (AGC) is a typical ECPS application. Measurements from remote sensors may be manipulated by attackers when telemetered to the AGC center, thereby disrupting the balance of power and frequency stability. In this situation, cyber-attack- tolerant AGC plays an important role in the face of cybersecurity threats. To achieve the cyber-attack-tolerant AGC, some strategies including the physics-based and data-driven attack mitigation schemes have been employed. In this chapter, inspired by the fault detection, diagnosis and reconfiguration in fault-tolerant control theories, a hybrid physics-based and data-driven mitigation model is developed for AGC under false data injection attacks (FDIAs). A mathematical model is derived to reveal the causal relation between the FDIA signal and compromised AGC measurement data. Then, data-driven approaches are employed to establish the mapping between the compromised measurement data and power compensation. Finally, the compensation-based mitigation model is developed. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Attack; Automatic generation control; Data-driven mitigation model; Electrical cyber-physical system; False data injection","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153070881"

Nonetheless, broad adoption and commercial viability of the technology is limited by its low durability and reliability. These limitations can be addressed by developing and implementing a fuel cell management system. In this paper, gas starvation faults in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have been studied. The causes, consequences, and the fault indicators (features) are identified. The sensitivities of fault indicators and how they affect the performance have been evaluated. Subsequently, a hybrid fault diagnosis method that combines residual-based fault detection with data-driven fault isolation has been proposed. Fault detection is achieved using a physics-based white-box model while fault isolation is achieved using a data-driven approach. Two supervised machine learning classifiers, namely the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and the support vector machine (SVM) have been developed. The performances of these methods are compared in terms of their accuracy and computation time. Moreover, the effect of additional indicators has been evaluated. The results show that starvation faults on the PEMFC can be detected and isolated efficiently and correctly, thanks to the fault indicators and the hybrid nature of the diagnostic method. Also, from the presented results, it can be deduced that the kNN classifier has outperformed the SVM classifier.  © 2023 IEEE.","data-driven fault isolation; Fault diagnosis; fuel cell management system; machine learning; model-based fault detection; proton exchange membrane fuel cells; reactants starvation; residuals","Classification (of information); Failure analysis; Information management; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Support vector machines; Data driven; Data-driven fault isolation; Fault isolation; Faults diagnosis; Fuel cell management system; Machine-learning; Management systems; Model-based fault detection; Proton-exchange membranes fuel cells; Reactant starvations; Residual; Fault detection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184807388"

Based on the architecture of experimental physics and industrial control system, the method reads the collected monitoring data to the monitoring platform through the data interface, and then realizes the anomaly detection and processing of the data through the steps of transformation regression analysis, time series monitoring, correlation monitoring and intelligent algorithm, which is mainly composed of four parts: data collection, anomaly identification and early warning information. A fault diagnosis method of convolutional neural network and bidirectional long short-term memory network algorithm based on attention mechanism is designed, and the attention mechanism is introduced to adjust the weight of captured information vectors to make up for the shortcomings of precocious convergence.

On this basis, the characteristic parameters of different physical signals are extracted, and the surface discharge process is divided into stages by hierarchical clustering, and the corresponding physical description and stage characteristics are given. The results show that: the sensitivities of different detection methods are different under surface discharge, and the sensitivity of ultrasonic method is the highest. Based on the corresponding multi-physics characteristic parameters, the surface discharge process can be divided into the initial stage, the development stage and the pre-breakdown stage by clustering, and the stage change of the whole process is related to the insulation state and the electric field distribution.

This transformational effort is associated with a tremendous increase of the complexity of the on board systems and their multi physics coupled behaviours. A critical aspect relates to the characterization of the coupled fault modes resulting from the integration of these novel technologies, which introduce identify ability issues and demand new approaches for the efficient identification of (multimodal) non-nominal conditions. Model-based fault detection and identification (FDI) has been provenessential to infer on board systems’ health from signal acquisitions, but existing methods are too expensive and fail to capture incipient faults in presence of multimodality which prevent scaling to complex multi physics systems. This work introduces a multi fidelity framework to accelerate the identification of fault modes affecting complex systems. An original two-stage compression computes an optimally informative and highly reduced representation of the monitoring signals for the minimum demand of on board resources. A multi fidelity scheme for Bayesian inversion is developed to infer multi domain fault parameters from the compressed signals: variable cost and fidelity models are optimally queried for a major reduction of the overall computational expense. The framework is demonstrated and validated for aerospace electro mechanical actuators affected by incipient multimodal faults. Remarkable accelerations of the FDI procedure are observed and the exact identification of the incipient fault condition achieved one order of magnitude faster than with standard algorithms. © 2023, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Apart from anomalies that can be detected in a preliminary phase after the start-up, soft faults such as refrigerant leakage and heat exchanger fouling may cause a performance degradation in such systems that evolves in time and that must be detected before it becomes too big. From this perspective, in a previous paper (Pelella et al. [1]) it has been demonstrated that, in cooling mode, a seasonal performance penalization up to 50% can be reached in case of a not-planned maintenance scenario, whereas wherever a timed or intelligent maintenance strategy is implemented based on data-monitoring, this impact can be significantly reduced. Therefore, in order to extend the analysis previously carried out to the heating cases, and to evaluate the consequent energetic degradation of the system in case of soft faults occurring, depending on different climate conditions and maintenance scenarios, this paper develops a physic-based model to simulate system components and to describe the fault phenomenology on a residential 2.6 kW air-to-air heat pump, operating in winter mode. The results show that in heating mode a 40% condenser fouling and a 30% refrigerant leakage cause a performance degradation of respectively 16% and 12%, whereas in case of evaporator fouling the performance penalization is only of 3.2%. Moreover, the performance degradation is enhanced by the overlapping effect of simultaneous faults. Finally, from seasonal simulations of the heat pump along an entire machine lifetime of 12 years, it is found that none of the maintenance strategies analysed is able to significantly reduce the number of scenarios penalized by faults, opening to the potential development of systems for the automatic fault detection, diagnosis, and evaluation (FDDE). © 2023 The Authors","Diagnosis and evaluation; Fault detection; Heat pumps; Physics-based model; Seasonal performance degradation; Soft faults","Air source heat pumps; Climate models; Maintenance; Pumps; Refrigerants; Diagnose and evaluation; Faults detection; Heat pumps; Penalisation; Performance degradation; Physics-based models; Refrigerant leakages; Seasonal performance; Seasonal performance degradation; Soft faults; Fault detection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153066335"

Based on this, a plasma information-based virtual metrology (PI-VM) algorithm was developed drastically enhanced process prediction performance by parameterizing plasma information (PI) which can trace the states of processing plasmas. PI-VM has superior process prediction accuracy compared to the classical statistics-based virtual metrologies. The developed PI-VM algorithms adopted for practical processing issues such as the control and management of the OLED-display mass production demonstrated savings of approximately 25% of the yield loss over the past 5 years. This improvement was achieved with the development of FDC (fault detection and classification) and APC (advanced process control) logic, which can be developed through the analysis of the physical characteristics of the feature parameters used in PI-VM with the evaluation of their contributions and their correlations to the processing results.

As adaptability can be achieved with residual generation, the focus is on this step. The modular toolbox-based approach combines physics-based and data-driven modeling concepts and, thus, enables highly flexible application to various types of engine test beds.

In the creation, often emphasis is put on building physics or user behavior. In modern buildings, automation systems play an important role to guarantee user comfort requirements as well as an energy efficient operation. To replicate the behavior of real HVAC systems in Building Performance Simulations, the underlying control logic has to be known.

This poses a huge challenge for the automotive industry where engine sizes have been continuously decreasing due to the demand for weight savings and integration with electrified powertrains. Such downsized engines typically require increased boost pressure, availing conditions conducive to pre-ignition, which in turn may trigger super-knock. Traditionally, this and other forms of knock have been managed by way of a ""detection and mitigation""approach in place of ""perdition and avoidance""due to an evolving understanding of corresponding combustion dynamics, as well as the incapability of emerging real-time computational methods to perform and actuate over the timescale required. In this study, a data-driven algorithm is used to extract (and adapt) a globally linearized system representation using eigen-time-series, isolating the dynamic modes of the system to capture underlying effects leading to pre-ignition without the need for physics-based modeling. This approach is a unique application of the ""Hankel Alternative View of Koopman""(HAVOK) analysis for chaotic systems and can be executed on board an engine control module supplying a buffer of recent to latest time-step data to predict an impending pre-ignition event. The proposed design does not require any change to existing sensors and actuators in the existing knock management system architecture, nor would it require any significant increase in computational capacity in terms of the associated engine control unit. A simulation was conducted with real super-knock data to nominally test the applicability of the algorithm. From this training dataset, the linearized dynamic system was able to predict pre-ignition approximately 2.27 s prior to the event, which is adequate to take mitigating action. Further validation runs covering low, medium, and high engine speeds within the envelope of low-speed pre-ignition (LSPI) generated similar results. © 2023 SAE International.","Engine prognostics; Fault prediction; Hybrid systems; Pre-ignition; Super-knock; System identification","Automotive industry; Forecasting; Hybrid systems; Ignition; Real time systems; Boost pressure; Engine prognostic; Engine size; Fault prediction; Power densities; Pre-ignition; Real-time prediction; Super-knock; System-identification; Weight saving; Chaotic systems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135173895"

Data-driven methods are especially fit for this task as they can leverage all the data recorded and archived by a typical control system.

It is a type of testing that aims at ensuring that recent modifications have not adversely affected the software product. After the introduction of a new change in the system under test, the number of test cases significantly increases to handle the modification. Consequently, it becomes prohibitively expensive to execute all of the generated test cases within the allocated testing time and budget. To address this situation, the test suite reduction (TSR) technique is widely used that focusses on finding a representative test suite without compromising its effectiveness such as fault-detection capability. In this work, a systematic review study is conducted that intends to provide an unbiased viewpoint about TSR based on various types of search algorithms. The study's main objective is to examine and classify the current state-of-the-art approaches used in search-based TSR contexts. To achieve this, a systematic review protocol is adopted and, the most relevant primary studies (57 out of 210) published between 2007 and 2022 are selected. Existing search-based TSR approaches are classified into five main categories, including evolutionary-based, swarm intelligence-based, human-based, physics-based, and hybrid, grounded on the type of employed search algorithm. Moreover, the current work reports the parameter settings according to their category, the type of considered operator(s), and the probabilistic rate that significantly impacts on the quality of the obtained solution. Furthermore, this study describes the comparison baseline techniques that support the empirical comparison regarding the cost-effectiveness of a search-based TSR approach. Finally, it isconcluded that search-based TSR has great potential to optimally solve the TSR problem. In this regard, several potential research directions are outlined as useful for future researchers interested in conducting research in the TSR domain. © 2023 The Authors.

The method introduces a fault suspect component library formed with coupling pre-judgment and a fault diagnosis model, which simplifies the process of network analysis and improves the speed of the fault diagnosis. The method makes full use of the time constraint relationship of the alarm information, correctly selects the action time point, and achieves an improvement of the fault diagnosis accuracy. In addition, considering the problem that the measurement equipment coverage is not comprehensive in the actual distribution network, the proposed method inputs the characteristic information collected by the D-PMU at the typical measurement point into the Petri net model, analyzes the fault of the distribution network, and avoids the problem of the scheduling being risky due to the result of the probabilistic form.

It takes countless hours of practice to develop the skill, and methods such as video feedback and coaching serve as aids to the process. However, few methods outside of visual observations exist to identify factors in the swing that cause a poor shot. Most golf analysis equipment is expensive and requires extensive setup time. Some systems only measure the physics of the ball and are limited to the practice range, whereas wearable sensors for golf are limited to specific motions such as the wrist. To address these challenges, a fabric-based, on-body sensor was developed and investigated to assess biomechanical movements during the swing. The wearable sensor, herein referred to as Motion Tape (MT), is a low-profile, disposable, self-adhesive, skin-strain sensor formed by spray-coating piezoresistive graphene nanocomposites directly onto kinesiology tape (K-tape). The objective of this study is to use MT to identify key movements in the swing sequence at four body locations: wrist, flexor carpi, anterior deltoid, and torso. First, MT sensors were fabricated for testing. Second, a human subject test protocol recording the golf swing of an experienced golfer was designed and conducted with participants wearing four MT sensors at the aforementioned locations. Last, the test data were processed, and the results showed that MT was able to identify unique movements during the swing. The MT data was analyzed using machine learning algorithms to identify movement abnormalities associated with poor swings. This allows for analysis of swing tempo for direct feedback to the golfer for improved performance. © 2023 by DEStech Publi cations, Inc.

The paper illustrates that integrated modeling of human user and AAS from the human-in-the-loop human-in-the-plant (HIL-HIP) perspective can potentially enable detection of unknown unknowns before it results in fatal safety violations. We propose a novel framework for analyzing the operational output characteristics of safety-critical HIL-HIP systems to discover unknown-unknown scenarios and evaluate potential safety hazards. We propose dynamics-induced hybrid recurrent neural networks (DiH-RNN) to mine a physics-guided surrogate model (PGSM) that checks for deviation of the AAS from safety-certified operational characteristics. The PGSM enables early detection of unknown-unknowns based on the physical laws governing the system.

Thanks to the rise in popularity of machine learning techniques, the number of purely data-driven approaches that try to tackle the issue of vibration-based condition monitoring has also drastically improved. Instead of directly using the vibration measurement data as input to a machine learning model, this work first exploits the cyclostationary characteristics inherent to vibration waveforms originating from rotating machinery. The proposed methodology first estimates the two-dimensional cyclic spectral coherence map of a vibration signal in order to decompose the cyclic modulations on the cyclic and carrier frequency plane. While this provides an effective tool to visualize any potential modulation signatures of faulty gears or bearings, it does not allow for easy inspection over time due to its dimensions. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes an unsupervised deep learning approach to wield this vast amount of data as a tool for detecting persistent changes in the modulation characteristics of the vibration signals. In the first phase, a deep autoencoder learns to reconstruct predictions of the cyclic coherence maps based on unlabeled healthy vibration data and the machine operating conditions. Two post-processing steps improve the predictions by mitigating frequency shifts and outlier or noisy measurements. Lastly, the residual error between the predicted and the actual coherence map is then aggregated and employed for further alarming based on thresholds. The autoencoder model is trained using five years of gearbox vibration data from five different wind turbines. The methodology is then validated on two faulty and eight healthy turbines. The results confirm that the proposed approach can deliver clear indications of failure for the faulty turbine while being completely devoid of any significant alarm trends for the healthy turbines. Thanks to the combination of highly effective cyclostationary signal processing with deep learning while using the operating conditions, the proposed methodology can detect and track incipient mechanical faults from non-stationary vibration data of rotating machinery. Lastly, it is important to emphasize that the proposed method is capable of learning the healthy behavior on one turbine and predicting the expected behavior on another turbine. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Cyclic spectral coherence; Deep learning; Fault detection; Unsupervised learning; Vibration signals","Condition monitoring; Deep learning; Failure (mechanical); Forecasting; Gears; Modulation; Rotating machinery; Vibrations (mechanical); Wind turbines; Auto encoders; Coherence maps; Cyclic spectral coherence; Deep learning; Early fault; Faults detection; Operating condition; Spectral coherence; Vibration data; Vibration signal; Fault detection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138123261"

The multiphysics signal fusion strategy with the application of convolution correlation analysis proposed in the method could effectively extract the spatial characteristic representation between multiphysics signals, and minimize the difference among the characteristic correlation matrixes of multiphysics signals between different data domains by using the maximum mean difference. At the same time, the feature correlation matrix sequence was input into the constructed long-term short-term memory neural network to extract the temporal correlation characteristics of the signals. Thus, the method can fully extract both spatial and temporal correlation characteristics of multi-physics field signals, effectively improving the accuracy of transfer diagnosis. The method was verified by using the collected data on a pump fault simulation test bench that had been self designed and built. The results show that the proposed method can fully extract the domain invariant characteristics of multi-physics field signals, and obtain better diagnostic results in cross-condition fault diagnosis tasks. © 2023 Chinese Vibration Engineering Society.

In Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) field, the CNN's input size is usually designed as a 1D vector or 2D square matrix, and the convolution kernel size is also defined as a square shape like 3 × 3 and 5 × 5, which are directly adopted from the image recognition. Though satisfying results can be obtained, CNN with such parameter specifications is not optimal and efficient. To this end, this paper elaborated the physical characteristics of bearing acceleration signals to guide the CNN design. First, the fault period under different fault types and shaft rotation frequency were used to determine the size of CNN's input. Next, an exponential function was involved in fitting the envelope of decaying acceleration signal during each fault period, and signal length within different decaying ratios was used to define the CNN's kernel size. Finally, the designed CNN was validated with the Case Western Reserve University bearing dataset and Paderborn University bearing dataset.

The best way to implement process monitoring is to develop models that describe different phenomena in physics, chemistry, and processes. However, because the modeling of industrial processes is often very complex and has significant intrinsic nonlinearities, a reasonable theoretical modeling method are often impractical. With the adoption of distributed control systems, the application of multivariate statistical monitoring is becoming more and more popular in the distributed system environment. This paper uses the technology for multivariate monitoring of continuous production processes. Based on principal component analysis (PCA) and making full use of system statistics information, the method can well deal with the nonlinear and multimode distribution of industrial data, which is difficult to be dealt with by traditional methods. This method can be used not only in process detection but also in fault detection.

To build a fault detection model, it is required to capture the domain invariant features not influenced by speed variations. Existing methods for bearing fault detection exploit data-driven deep learning models without considering any structural information of bearing. This paper proposes a physics-informed deep learning approach for bearing fault detection across different working conditions of the motor. The proposed method utilizes the power spectrum of the envelope signal (PSES) from the vibration data as an input feature for 1D CNN deep learning network. The proposed method is compared with the Random Forest and 1D CNN with raw data input and evaluated on two public bearing datasets to demonstrate its superior performance and robustness to speed variation. The proposed method is able to predict cross-domain bearing faults with an average accuracy of 94.2% which is 23% higher than the existing state-of-the-art data-driven approach. © 2023 IEEE.","Deep learning; Fault detection; Feature extraction; Physics knowledge","Bearings (machine parts); Deep learning; Feature extraction; Induction motors; Learning systems; Bearing fault detection; Cross-domain; Deep learning; Faults detection; Features extraction; Learning approach; Physic knowledge; Physics-based; Rotational speed; Speed variations; Fault detection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170637236"

Periodic inspections and intermittent vibration data collection using accelerometers is among the most common methods. Electrical signature analysis is an alternative approach that only uses electrical measurements for the purpose of fault detection. Despite the unique advantages of this method, such as its non-intrusiveness and possibility of continuous monitoring of the equipment, there have been limited studies on its underlying theory with majority of the proposed ESA-based methods taking data-driven approach towards condition monitoring problem. Data-driven methods rely on the experimental data collected from the equipment to train the statistical models. This imposes a serious limitation on the application of electrical signature analysis and makes the generalization harder. In this paper the electromechanical coupling in a motor-driven centrifugal pump is studied in order to demonstrate the effects of different operating conditions of pump on motor electrical signals. Lumped parameter approach is employed to derive governing equations of the induction motor and computational fluid dynamics is utilized to analyze the interaction of the centrifugal pump blades and fluid. Such a modeling platform presents a physics-based approach towards electrical signature analysis based condition monitoring.

Scalable condition monitoring solutions exist for both Fixed Offshore Wind and floating Oil and Gas, however a holistic solution addressing aerodynamic and hydrodynamic challenges on a floating wind unit is lacking. Where sensors should be minimized, or for unmeasurable parameters, digital twins offer an alternative for predicting major component condition, relying instead on numerical models based on floater global response and metocean conditions. This paper demonstrates the potential of reconstructed load signals, state-of-the-art sensors and first principles physics-based digital twins using approaches from the Wind and Oil and Gas sectors. Existing motion-based integrity monitoring methods are adapted to a real-time reduced-order model of a floating wind unit. Specifically, a state-observer model is used to reproduce position and mooring tension, enabling mooring failure identification and fatigue tracking. The methods are demonstrated through a 15 MW synthetic case study, including examination of the impact of noise and sensor loss on reliability. The results show that the integration of digital twins into sensor-based monitoring systems can reconstruct missing data with sufficient certainty to facilitate early detection of failures.

Existing warning methods often rely solely on artificial intelligence for determining either a single parameter threshold or conducting comprehensive analysis. However, the performance of these artificial models is often unsatisfactory due to imbalanced training samples or the neglect of environmental operating conditions. This paper proposes a fault warning method for power transformers based on neural network algorithm guided by multi-physics simulation. Firstly, we performed electromagnetic-thermal-fluid coupling simulations of the power transformer using COMSOL software. This model enables the analysis of temperature changes inside the transformer under various operating conditions and environmental factors. Secondly, we trained the transformer fault warning model by combining actual measurement data with multi-physics field simulation data. We utilized a neural network autoencoder algorithm to detect deviations between actual measurement data and simulated estimation data, thereby achieving accurate fault warning for transformers. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method was demonstrated through a series of simulation experiments, with results indicate an anomaly detection accuracy of 99.50%. This method significantly enhances the detection accuracy of transformer thermal state, thereby holding practical value in engineering applications.  © 2023 IEEE.","artificial model; fault warning; multi-physics field simulation; power transformer","Anomaly detection; Electromagnetic simulation; Fault detection; Thermal Engineering; Actual measurements; Artificial model; Fault warning; Field simulation; Measurement data; Multi-physic field simulation; Multi-physics; Multiphysics simulations; Neural networks algorithms; Operating condition; Power transformers","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184999838"

Furthermore, cloud computing and easy-to-integrate sensors have boosted the development of digital twins. Such digital twins use data from sensors on physical objects, to improve the understanding of manufacturing processes as a whole or of certain production parameters. That way, digital twins can demonstrate the impact of design changes, usage scenarios, environmental conditions or similar variables. One important application of such digital twins lies in early detection of manufacturing faults, such that real prototypes need to be used less. This reduces development times and allows products to be individually, affordable, powerful, robust and environmentally friendly. While typically simple USB-camera setups or melt-pool imaging are used for this task, most solutions are difficult to integrate into existing processes and hard to calibrate and evaluate. We propose a digital-twin-based solution, that leverages information from camera-images in a self-supervised fashion, and creates a heat transfer based AI quality monitoring.

This paper describes a physics-based approach for system-level diagnosis in thermal–hydraulic systems in nuclear power plants. The inclusion of physics information allows for the creation of virtual sensors, which provide improved fault diagnosis capability. The physics information also serves to better constrain diagnostic solutions to the physical domain. As a demonstration, various test cases for fault diagnosis in a high-pressure feedwater system were considered. The use of virtual sensors allows constructing performance models for two first-point feedwater heaters which would not have been possible otherwise due to the limited sensor set. Real-time plant data provided by a utility partner were used to assess the diagnostic approach. The detection of an abnormal event immediate after a plant startup pointed to faulty behaviors in the two first-point feedwater heaters. This double-blind fault diagnosis was subsequently confirmed by the plant operator.

The operational behavior of such CPS may change during deployment due to several reasons including: a) control system software bugs, b) environmental changes such as weather, and c) mechanical faults such as faulty sensor. Changes in operational characteristics can be exceptionally dangerous in civilian applications or when UAVs are used for military purposes or targeted precision tasks such as maneuvering in hostile environment. Moreover, safety violations are often not caused by a single fault but rather by a combination of faults that can potentially be avoided if the individual faults were pro-actively identified and mitigated. In this paper, we advocate for continuous verification of the operational characteristics to check its compliance with the specification. This compliance can be specified using Signal Temporal Logic (STL) on the output trajectories. However, unknown errors can cause operational changes that have little effect on the output characteristics but may manifest with fatal consequences when combined with other supervisory control systems. As such the problem of identifying such underlying changes is a difficult task specially when their impact on output characteristics is minimal. We propose a novel framework for analyzing the stochastic conformance of operational output characteristics of safety-critical CPS in terms of the coefficients of a physics guided surrogate model (PGSM) of the aerodynamics of the aviation CPS. We propose model guided hybrid recurrent neural networks (MGH-RNN) to mine a PGSM which is used to check the model conformance using STL on the model coefficients. The PGSM can also identify operational changes due to unknown errors. Additionally, we also derive a tractable input space partitioning mechanism based on PGSM characteristics to perform stochastic conformance checking by utilizing the conformal inference technique. We apply our technique to identify errors in pitch control system of aircrafts or UAVs.

This paper firstly expounds arc physical properties, and theoretically analyzes the relationship between arc length and arcing voltage. Then, the magnetohydrodynamic model of AC arc is established by COMSOL Multiphysics, and the influence of arc length on electric field intensity, temperature, voltage and current of arc plasma is analyzed. Secondly, based on the influence of arc length on arc, an improved Schwarz arc model considering dynamic arc length is proposed, which not only considers arc time constant and dissipated power as functions of arc conductance, but also introduces arc length. The comparison error of the arcing voltage of the improved Schwarz model with actual measured data is 5%. In addition, the arcing voltage is compared with calculation results of theoretical formula and simulation results of magnetohydrodynamic model, which verifies the validity of improved arc model. Finally, the improved arc model is compared with Mayr model, Schwarz model and cybernetic model from the perspectives of arc voltage and current, and analysis shows that the improved arc model is reasonable in simulating arcing voltage, arc steady-state combustion voltage, and current zero-break characteristics. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers.","Arc length; Arc model; Arcing voltage; Schwarz model","Electric fields; Fault detection; Magnetoplasma; Multiphysics; Arc characteristics; Arc length; Arcing voltage; ARCS model; Dynamic arc length; Electric field intensities; High impedance fault detection; Magnetohydrodynamic model; Multi-physics; Schwarz model; Magnetohydrodynamics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141124780"

Their roots are developed in the Ordovician or Cambrian carbonate rocks, and pass upward through Carboniferous, Permian, Triassic strata, and even enter the Jurassic, Cretaceous and Quaternary loose rock strata. Over the past 80 years, more than 10,000 mines have been exposed in 39 mining areas in the coalfields of North China, resulting in more than 20 major water inrush accidents. Therefore, the study on KCCs is of important theoretical and practical significance for the systematic understanding of karst hydrogeological conditions of mines in North China and of prevention and control of karst water disaster as well. This study systematically summarized the spatial distribution characteristics of KCCs in the coalfields of North China, mainly focusing the areas along the Fenhe river, the western foothills of Taihang mountain, the foothills of eastern and southeastern Taihang mountain, the foothills of southern Yanshan mountain, and the west side of the Tanlu fault zone. The plane shapes of KCCs are mostly circular and elliptical, and their cross-sections are mainly cone-shaped. KCCs are usually filled and cemented by broken debris of wall rock and secondary minerals, so most of the collapsed columns in the coalfields do not conduct (contain) water, and only few cases of water inrush occur there. KCCs usually form in such basic conditions as soluble rocks and special stratigraphic structures, multi-stage and multisource fluid erosiveness, geological tectonic evolution, and paleokarst groundwater flow. Five theories on the genesis mechanism have been put forward, namely “karst gravity collapse”, “gypsum dissolution collapse”, “vacuum absorption collapse”, “hydrothermal origin” and “groundwater internal circulation”. According to the current research on the formation and evolution of KCCs in the Huainan coalfield in the southern margin of North China, this study shows that consisting of Ordovician or Cambrian carbonate rocks, KCCs move through fluid migration channels of faults and fractures generated by multi-stage tectonic movements in this area, and are accommodated with the paleokarst formed by dissolution in the carbonate rocks. After a long-term process of dissolution, transportation, and collapse, KCCs are finally formed with the joint effect of the self-gravity of the rock mass, the in-situ stress, and the vacuum negative pressure in the cave. The formation of KCCs is related to the multistage tectonic movements in Mesozoic, and the Yanshan movement might be the key stage of its formation and development. In this study, the water inrush mechanism of KCCs in the mining process is reviewed from the aspects of mining-induced water inrush mechanism, seepage transformation mechanism, and water inrush model. Four modes of water inrush of KCCs in working face or roadway, as well as the mechanical mechanism and seepage transformation mechanism of water inrush are analyzed, and the reasons for the sudden and hysteresis of water inrush are also explained. The technical route for KCC detection and prevention are determined by geophysical prospecting, geochemical prospecting, roadway prospecting, drilling, and hydrogeological conditions. At present, the prevention and control of KCC water disaster is mainly carried out from two aspects,exploration and treatment. In terms of exploration, several methods can be used. The technology of three-dimensional seismic exploration can be adopted to preliminarily determine the impacted area of collapse columns. The comprehensive geophysical method can be used to detect the water-bearing area of KCCs. The exact location, shape and hydrogeological characteristics of KCCs can be determined by methods of drilling, the test of pumping (draining) water, geochemical exploration and others. In terms of treatment, two methods can be mainly adopted,water-proof coal (rock) pillar retention and grouting reinforcement/water blocking to cut off the hydraulic connection between the KCCs water channel and the water inrush source. This technology has been successfully applied in the treatment of KCCs in the mining areas subject to karst water disaster such as Hebei and Anhui. As to the research gap and deficiency in the prevention of water disaster caused by KCCs, the following suggestions are put forward, (1) Under the guidance of earth system science, the study on evolution of KCCs can be conducted combined with the formation mechanism of KCCs. Meanwhile, a multidisciplinary method involving petrology, structural geology, hydrology, geomorphology, karst hydrogeology, GIS, RS, and others can also be applied based on the time axis of evolution of regional geological structure. (2) For the precise detection, data and interpretation of small hidden collapse columns, efforts should be made to perfect the basic theory of full-space physics, to develop new equipment, new technologies and new methods, to further improve the precision, resolution, anti-interference competence of geophysical exploration, and to increase the detection depth. (3) Research on the KCCs model of “dynamic monitoring-prediction model-water inrush mechanism” should be conducted. Firstly, a dynamic monitoring system to obtain parameters such as stress, deformation, acoustic emission, rupture (wave velocity), water pressure (position), water chemistry, and water temperature during the water inrush process of KCCs can be established, and an indicator monitoring instrument of stable multi-parameter can be developed. Secondly, with the help of big data and data processing technology of cloud platform, a multi-parameter integrated water inrush prediction model of KCCs can be established based on the dynamic monitoring system characterized by information transmission and the existing water-rock coupling numerical model. (4) The prevention and control technology system of KCCs water disaster should be established and improved. This system will mainly include the technical subsystem such as basic theoretical research on KCCs formation, exploration of KCC basic characteristics, prevention, management and emergency planing of KCC water disaster. In short, the establishment of the system is of important theoretical and practical significance for the research of KCCs and water disaster control. © 2022 Institute of Karst Geology of Chinese Academy of Geology Sciences.

Among the most useful datasets for photovoltaic array fault detection and diagnosis are module or string current-voltage (IV) curves. Unfortunately, such datasets are rarely collected due to the cost of high fidelity monitoring, and the data that is available is generally not ideal, often consisting of unbalanced classes, noisy data due to environmental conditions, and few samples. In this paper, we propose an alternate approach that utilizes physics-based simulations of string-level IV curves as a fully synthetic training corpus that is independent of the test dataset. In our example, the training corpus consists of baseline (no fault), partial soiling, and cell crack system modes. The training corpus is used to train a 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) for failure classification. The approach is validated by comparing the model’s ability to classify failures detected on a real, measured IV curve testing corpus obtained from laboratory and field experiments. Results obtained using a fully synthetic training dataset achieve identical accuracy to those obtained with use of a measured training dataset. When evaluating the measured data’s test split, a 100% accuracy was found both when using simulations or measured data as the training corpus. When evaluating all of the measured data, a 96% accuracy was found when using a fully synthetic training dataset. The use of physics-based modeling results as a training corpus for failure detection and classification has many advantages for implementation as each PV system is configured differently, and it would be nearly impossible to train using labeled measured data. © 2022 by the authors.","IV curves; neural networks; photovoltaic systems; simulation","Ability testing; Classification (of information); Convolutional neural networks; Fault detection; Machine learning; Solar panels; Failure classification; IV curve; Machine learning classification; Machine learning models; Neural-networks; Photovoltaic systems; Physics-based methods; Simulation; Training corpus; Training dataset; Statistical tests","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136452378"

However, the poor interpretability and noise robustness of CNNs have plagued both academia and industry. Since traditional signal analysis technology has a sound theoretical basis and physical meaning, it motivates us to use signal processing theory to improve the interpretability and performance of the CNN algorithm. To this end, this paper proposes a multilayer wavelet attention convolutional neural network (MWA-CNN) for noise-robust machinery fault diagnosis. This framework aims to learn discriminative fault features from the wavelet domain, which allows the model to obtain better interpretability and superior performance than conventional time-domain-based CNNs. The proposed Discrete Wavelet Attention Layer (DWA-Layer) is used to map time domain signals to wavelet space, and obtain valuable information through the learnable convolutional layer. By alternately using DWA-Layer and convolutional layer for signal decomposition and feature learning, the proposed framework actually embeds a similar multi-resolution analysis algorithm in CNN. This helps integrate physics-based knowledge into the CNN. Finally, the frequency attention mechanism is proposed to enhance the ability of MWA-CNN to obtain fault-related features from different frequency components. Experiments on high-speed aeronautical bearing and motor bearing datasets prove that the proposed method has excellent fault diagnosis ability and noise robustness. The visual analysis of the attention mechanism contributes to the interpretability of CNN in the field of fault diagnosis. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Attention mechanism; Convolutional neural network; Fault diagnosis; Wavelet transform","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Machine learning; Multilayer neural networks; Multilayers; Signal processing; Time domain analysis; Attention mechanisms; Convolutional neural network; Faults diagnosis; Feature learning; Interpretability; Machinery fault diagnosis; Noise robust; Noise robustness; Robust machinery; Wavelets transform; Wavelet transforms","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151311360"

We propose a novel method for data-driven fault diagnostics and validate it using the Tennessee Eastman process (TEP) benchmark. It is assumed that the time of the onset of the fault is known, such that time-series data from the process both before and after occurrence of the fault can be extracted. For each of the measured time-series, several statistical features are extracted. A statistical significance level is computed for each feature using inferential statistics measures. The matrix of significance levels serves as a 'fingerprint' of each fault category and is used as input to a feedforward neural network. We show that the network can be trained to achieve high classification accuracy on data from the TEP benchmark model. © 2023 IEEE.","Fault Diagnosis; Feature Extraction; Predictive Maintenance","Classification (of information); Complex networks; Data mining; Extraction; Fault detection; Feedforward neural networks; Industrial plants; Time series; Data-driven approach; Faults diagnosis; Faults diagnostics; Features extraction; Industrial processs; Inferential statistics; Predictive maintenance; Process plants; Significance levels; Tennessee Eastman process; Feature extraction","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164194083"

Due to the harsh working environment and the complex system structure, a marine system is prone to have many kinds of novelties and faults. Timely detection of faults via effective condition monitoring is vital for such systems, avoiding serious damage and economic loss. However, it is difficult to realize online monitoring because of the limitations of measurement and health monitoring methods. In this paper, a marine engine system simulator is set up with enhanced sensory placement for static and dynamic data collection. The test rig and processing for static and dynamic data are described. Then, a physics-based multivariate modeling method is proposed for the health monitoring of the system. Case studies are carried out considering the misfire fault and the exhaust valve leakage fault. In the misfire fault test, the exhaust gas temperature of the misfired cylinder dropped from the confidence interval 100–150 °C to 70–80 °C and the head vibration features decreased from the confidence interval 900–1300 m/s2 to around 200–300 m/s2. For the exhaust valve leakage fault, the engine body vibration main bearing impact RMS increased nearly 10 times. Comparisons between the model-predicted confidence interval and measured data reveal that the proposed model based on the fault-related static and dynamic features successfully identified the two faults and their positions, proving the effectiveness of the proposed framework. © 2023 by the authors.","condition monitoring; marine system; multivariate; physics-based modelling","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164142491"

A physics-based engine model is constructed, based on a 0-dimensional system analysis method, and then revised through performance adaptation with a basic engine model. Adaptation factors are used for the compressor, secondary air system, nozzle, exhaust gas temperature, and engine thrust. Gas path analysis is conducted using the physics-based engine model and the performance test data in real time. A health parameter that can quantitatively evaluate the performance difference of components was defined. Health parameters for the compressor capacity and efficiency, secondary air system, and nozzle are calculated from the gas path analysis. The multi-variable Newton–Raphson method is employed for the performance adaptation and gas path analysis in real time. A single-shaft gas turbine engine, which is constructed based on the core part of a turbofan engine currently under development, is utilized to test and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Three tests are performed for engine verification. The proposed diagnostic method is applied to the aero gas turbine engine verification test. In 33 test cases, the fault detection rates for the compressor's variable guide vane, secondary air system, and variable area nozzle are 100%, 91%, and 79%, respectively. As a result, it is confirmed that the proposed method can simultaneously detect abnormalities in the compressor's variable guide vane, secondary air system, and variable area nozzle.

In this sense, monitoring-based commissioning and automated fault detection have demonstrated to be effective ways to reduce the overall building energy consumption. Machine learning strategies provide accurate results in the field, but in many applications, the historical data available, especially related to faults, is just not enough. Therefore, the use of a physics-based model of the facility can be useful to generate synthetic data for a fault detection scheme. or be used for the monitoring of the system. However, the calibration of these models is usually done manually based on domain knowledge of the modeller and detailed information about the facility. In this study, a methodology for the calibration of an integrated model with the coupled interaction between the building and HVAC dynamics using Heteroscedastic Evolutionary Bayesian Optimization (HEBO) is presented. The proposed framework is demonstrated in a real use case by simultaneously calibrating 45 different parameters for a Modelica model of an air-handling unit coupled to a building using 15 days of data gathered from the building management system.

High voltage circuit breakers are a vital component of the new power system, and once a fault occurs, it may seriously affect the safe and stable operation of the power system. To solve the current problem of inaccurate mechanical fault diagnosis of high-voltage circuit breakers, this paper proposes a data-driven method for extracting fault feature parameters of high-voltage circuit breakers and establishes a fault diagnosis model based on an improved SVDD (Support Vector Data Description) algorithm. This study uses wavelet packet decomposition to extract two eigenvectors, wavelet node entropy and relative energy value, from high-voltage circuit breaker vibration signals, and also proposes a dimensionality reduction algorithm based on kernel function entropy component analysis, which effectively improves the efficiency of eigenparameter extraction. Then, an improved SVDD algorithm is proposed for fast and accurate classification and identification of high-voltage circuit breaker fault types. Finally, the simulation algorithm is validated based on the actual fault data set of high-voltage circuit breakers. Through experiments, we have confirmed that the method proposed in this paper achieves significant results in identifying different types of mechanical faults in high-voltage circuit breakers, which is essential to ensure the safe and stable operation of power systems. © 2023 IEEE.","cyber-physical systems; fault diagnosis; high-voltage circuit breakers","Condition monitoring; Cyber Physical System; Data mining; Electric circuit breakers; Embedded systems; Extraction; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Feature extraction; Timing circuits; Vibration analysis; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Fault diagnosis model; Faults diagnosis; High-voltage circuit breaker; High-voltage circuits; Power; Safe operation; Stable operation; Voltage circuit breakers; Entropy","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188058525"

Fault detection under such a situation is usually tackled by modeling the baseline CM data and then detect the fault by examining any deviation of the baseline model versus newly monitored data. Given that the CM data is mostly time series, the long-short term memory (LSTM) neural network can be employed for baseline CM data modeling. The LSTM is free from the choice of the number of lagged input time series and can also store both long-term and short-term time series dependency information. However, we found that an LSTM with its hyperparameters selected whilst minimizing validation mean squared error (VAMSE) does not differentiate the faulty and healthy states well. There is still room for detectability improvement. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed hyperparameters selection strategy for the LSTM identification and subsequently the fault detection of gearboxes. The key idea of the proposed strategy is to select hyperparameters based on maximizing the discrepancy between healthy and physics-informed faulty states, as opposed to minimizing VAMSE. Case studies have been conducted to detect the gear tooth crack and tooth wear using laboratory test rigs. Results have shown that the proposed physics-informed hyperparameters selection strategy returns an LSTM that can better detect these faults than the LSTM returned from minimizing VAMSE. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Fault Detection; Gearbox; Long-Short Term Memory; Physics-Informed Hyperparameters Selection","Brain; Condition monitoring; Fault detection; Gears; Mean square error; Time series; Base-line conditions; Condition-monitoring data; Faults detection; Gearbox; Health management; Hyper-parameter; Large volumes; Mean squared error; Physic-informed hyperparameter selection; Times series; Long short-term memory","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124232553"

Evidently, the ability to automatically detect changes in a structure is a very attractive feature. When there is no prior knowledge on the system, deep learning models could effectively detect a change and enhance the capability of determining the damage location. However, the acquisition of data related to damaged structures is not always practical. In this paper, two deep learning approaches, a physics-informed autoencoder and a simple data-driven autoencoder, are applied to a test rig consisting of a small four-storey building model. Modifications to the system are simulated by changing the stiffness of the springs. Both the machine learning algorithms outperform the traditional approach based on an experimental modal analysis.

Thus, this paper develops a novel modeling and diagnostic approach for the detection and identification of the most frequent faults that affect DHN pipes, i.e., water leakages, heat losses and pressure losses. The modeling approach exploits physics-based equations for calculating all DHN measurable variables, i.e., flow rate, temperature and pressure. The diagnostic approach detects and identifies pipe faults by coupling the modeling approach with an optimization algorithm. As a result, the diagnostic approach provides the health indices of each pipe of the DHN, which identify the faulty pipe, the fault type and its magnitude. The modeling approach proves to be extremely accurate since the Root Mean Square Error of the DHN variables is always lower than 0.02%. Furthermore, the modeling approach is exploited to infer general guidelines about the DHN health state to investigate the relationship between health indices and DHN characteristics. The novel diagnostic approach is verified by implanting six faults in the DHN of the campus of the University of Parma.

These vehicles are composed of a large variety of interacting components and sensors that are needed for safe operation and to carry out their respective missions. As their interactions, complexity, and numbers increase, the risk for anomalies such as degradation of components, sensor faults, and erroneous controls also increase. These anomalies pose significant risks for vehicles flying over densely populated areas or conducting critical missions. It is therefore crucial to detect and mitigate these anomalies. There exist several approaches for anomaly detection, such as traditional rule or threshold-based methods, model-based approaches, supervised machine learning-based methods, and even unsupervised methods to detect different types of abnormal behaviors. These methods have inherent drawbacks including lack of sensitivity, inability to detect previously unknown faults, not being robust to compromised in-network information, or requiring sophisticated system models. To this end, we propose BDAV, a Battery-based Diagnosis for Aerial Vehicles, that uses machine learning models to learn physics-based dependencies and an unsupervised algorithm to detect and identify anomalies. BDAV is inspired by the physical dependencies between a vehicle’s operation and the concomitant power consumption, allowing the use of battery as a trustworthy sensor to detect anomalies in a vehicle’s operation(a hardware-based root-of-trust). Specifically, BDAV utilizes features extracted from run-time battery voltage and current information to construct learning models (norm maps) that map dependencies independently between battery metrics and each system operational variable. During operations, these norm maps allow operational variable values to be estimated assuming non-anomalous behavior. Some residual errors are expected in these predictions, however the cumulative sum of the error between the predictions and observed values is expected to follow a linear trend during normal operation of a system. Anomalies are detected when deviations in this trend are observed, which are quantified using five key parameters of the unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm. Preliminary optimization of BDAV parameters and testing on an electric-propulsion testbed demonstrated anomaly detection rates up to 91% and false positive rates as low as 2.5% for operational variables such as propeller thrust, motor rpm, and system vibration across a variety of injected anomaly types. This approach is applicable to most systems with electric batteries and can be rapidly optimized and adapted for efficient and cost-effective onboard fault management. © 2022 Prognostics and Health Management Society.

The proposed methodology focuses on direct economic losses to buildings caused by the combined effect of ground shaking and post-earthquake fires and evaluates the exceedance probability of the regional shaking–fire losses in a predefined future time period by comprehensively considering the effects of various uncertain factors on the losses via Monte Carlo simulations. Probabilistic seismic risk assessments are extended by integrating post-earthquake fire models with seismic activity models, ground motion prediction equations, and seismic fragility functions. The fire models include post-earthquake ignition models, a weather model, a physics-based urban fire spread model, and a fire brigade response model. This integrated modeling enables the incorporation of the following uncertain factors with causal relationships into the assessments: earthquake occurrence, ground motion intensity distribution, damage to buildings resulting from ground shaking, post-earthquake ignition occurrence and occupant firefighting, weather condition, fire brigade response time including time to detection, and damage to buildings resulting from post-earthquake urban fire spread. To demonstrate the methodology, a realistic case study is conducted for a historical urban area with closely spaced wooden buildings in Kyoto, Japan, focusing on possible large earthquakes along major active faults.

Aero-engine failure diagnosis is based on condition-based monitoring, but the exhaust path parameters throughout the flight process are not used effectively. The exhaust of aircraft engine parameters are hot gases and particles of the unburnt fuel or erosion of the parts inside the engine. The electrostatic monitoring technology is extensively used for charge detection of exhaust particles. The problems faced by electrostatic sensing technology for effective fault analysis are the influence of the fluid flow parameters, position of the particles, and concentration of the particles. For this purpose, the Multiphysics coupling approach is proposed in this paper. The Multiphysics coupling scheme enables the investigation of the influence of these parameters on the electrostatic monitoring technology for fault monitoring of aero-engine. The Multiphysics coupling numerical Model of the aero-engine is developed with the optimal parameters of a probe-type electrostatic sensor. The COMSOL Multiphysics software is utilized for coupling flow field, heat transfer, particle tracing, and electrostatic physical parameters. The developed model is simulated at Mach number 0.3 for fluid flow parameters, and then ten particles of 10μm diameter are released randomly from the inlet. The position of particles shows that the particles are moving with the path followed by fluid flow parameters, and the output signal of the electrostatic sensor detects the charge created by the particles. Further, online fault monitoring by applying an electrostatic sensor was analyzed by adding a single particle with a higher diameter of 50μm. The addition of foreign particles increased the output voltage of the electrostatic sensor. This rapid change in the output signal of the electrostatic sensor confirmed the sensitivity of the developed model for fault monitoring of an aero-engine. © 2023 IEEE.","charge detection; Multiphysics coupling; numerical simulation; online monitoring; PHM of aero-engine","Engines; Flow of fluids; Heat transfer; Numerical models; Partial discharges; Aero-engine; Charge detection; Developed model; Electrostatic sensor; Fault monitoring; Fluid flow parameters; Monitoring technologies; Multi-physics couplings; Online monitoring; PHM of aero-engine; Aircraft engines","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191745743"

The integration of high-resolution time-synchronized measurements at a high reporting rate by phasor measurement units (PMUs) in the power grid operation provides an opportunity to develop data-driven applications. These applications permit power system monitoring and control to enable reliability and resiliency. Even if the present alarm and event processing tools help in monitoring and decision-making, anomaly, and event detection, higher accuracy for detection, classification, and localization can be achieved using synchrophasor data. PMUs can also identify the topology and operating device causing events with location information. However, PMU may face challenges in terms of data quality, affecting the performance of smart grid applications. This chapter first discusses an unsupervised ensemble learning approach for bad data detection for PMU data to address the issues mentioned above. Then we present two different methods for anomaly and event detection classification and localization. The first method used is a novel device-level unsupervised deep learning-based data-driven approach for event detection, localization, and classification over streaming PMU data, using online learning and multivariate data-drift detection algorithm. The second method used is density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) for event detection and physics-based rule and decision tree for event classification.

Accurate fault diagnosis of motor is a critical task and intelligent data-driven methods have gained significant advances. However, to obtain sufficient labeled data to train the models is expensive and laborious in industrial applications, and how to utilize three-phase current signals efficiently is a challenging task. To deal with these problems, a digital twin-enhanced semi-supervised framework is proposed for label-scarce motor fault diagnosis. First, a precise motor digital twin model is established based on multi-physics simulation and knowledge transfer is performed from the virtual space to the physical space. Second, a novel phase-contrastive current dot pattern (PCCDP) representation is proposed to transform three-phase motor stator current to a gray-scale image with an ordered arrangement and then characteristics of three phases can be contrasted in tight regions for efficient processing. Third, inter-space sample generation is proposed for continuous feature manifold learning to tackle discrepancy between spaces.

Early detection of these faults is crucial for battery safety and widespread deployment of fast charging. In this setting, we propose a real-time detection framework for battery voltage and thermal faults. A major challenge in battery fault detection arises from the effect of uncertainties originating from sensor inaccuracies, nominal aging, or unmodelled dynamics. Inspired by physics-based learning, we explore a detection paradigm that combines physics-based models, model-based detection observers, and data-driven learning techniques to address this challenge. Specifically, we construct the detection observers based on an experimentally identified electrochemical-thermal model, and subsequently design the observer tuning parameters following Lyapunov's stability theory. Furthermore, we utilize Gaussian Process Regression technique to learn the model and measurement uncertainties which in turn aid the detection observers in distinguishing faults and uncertainties. Such uncertainty learning essentially helps suppressing their effects, potentially enabling early detection of faults. We perform simulation and experimental case studies on the proposed fault detection scheme verifying the potential of physics-based learning in early detection of battery faults. © 1986-2012 IEEE.","Batteries; Extreme Fast Charging; Fault Detection; Physics-based Learning","Electric fault currents; Fast charging (Batteries); Learning systems; Secondary batteries; Uncertainty analysis; Electric vehicle batteries; Gaussian process regression; High-power operation; Learning techniques; Lyapunov's stability theories; Modeling and measurement; Physics-based models; Unmodelled dynamics; Fault detection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114598579"

However, estimation of transient NOx emissions using physics-based models is challenging due to its highly dynamic nature, which arises from the complex interactions between power demand, engine operation, and exhaust aftertreatment efficiency. As an alternative to physics-based models, a multi-dimensional data-driven approach is proposed as a framework to estimate NOx emissions across an extensive set of representative engine and exhaust aftertreatment system operating conditions. This paper employs Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to develop two models, an engine-out NOx and a tailpipe NOx model, to predict heavy-duty vehicle NOx emissions. The DNN models were developed using variables that are available from On-board Diagnostics from two datasets, an engine dynamometer and a chassis dynamometer dataset. Results from trained DNN models using the engine dynamometer dataset showed that the proposed approach can predict NOx emissions with high accuracy, where R2 scores are higher than 0.99 for both engine-out and tailpipe NOx models on cold/hot Federal Test Procedure (FTP) and Ramped Mode Cycle (RMC) data. Similarly, the engine-out and tailpipe NOx models using the chassis dynamometer dataset achieved R2 scores of 0.97 and 0.93, respectively. All models developed in this study have a mean absolute error percentage of approximately 1% relative to maximum NOx in the datasets, which is comparable to that of physical NOx emissions measurement analyzers. The input feature importance studies conducted in this work indicate that high accuracy DNN models (R2 = 0.92–0.95) could be developed by utilizing minimal significant engine and aftertreatment inputs. This study also demonstrates that DNN NOx emissions models can be very effective tools for fault detection in Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems.

First, the collected multi-physics signals of the centrifugal pump in different states was normalized; then, the correlation of any two normalized multi-physics signals was calculated to form a correlation matrix; and finally, the correlation matrix was used as a feature and the diagnosis was performed by virtue of the SVM. The failure data of a centrifugal pump was used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that compared with the fault diagnosis method that only uses a single signal, the method proposed can fully extract the multi-physics correlation information of the centrifugal pump.

In this framework, District Heating Networks (DHNs) do play an important role since the heat carrier is dispatched from a heat source to end-users. Reliability of DHNs can be affected by several faults, of which the negative consequences can be prevented by employing diagnostic methodologies to evaluate the health state of the DHN and promptly localize the fault cause. In the literature, DHN faults are usually detected by means of physics-based and data-driven methodologies, but their drawbacks may hinder their application. Thus, this paper proposes a hybrid approach composed of two steps aimed at detecting the most common faults occurring in DHNs, i.e., water leakages as well as anomalous heat and pressure losses. First, a data-driven diagnostic methodology is employed to assess whether a fault is occurring. Then, a physics-based diagnostic approach identifies the health indices of each pipe of the DHN, the fault position, its type and magnitude. In this paper, the hybrid diagnostic approach is applied to the DHN of the campus of the University of Parma, where different faults were artificially implanted. The diagnostic approach proves to correctly detect and identify the implanted faults, by also correctly estimating their magnitude even in the most challenging scenarios. © 2023 Institute of Physics Publishing.

However, a major obstacle is their degradation with several cycles or calendar aging. Battery Management System relies on an essential model-based algorithm to protect the battery from operating outside the safety limit. Thus, this work attempts to answer important research questions on battery models: (1) Are physics-based electrochemical models (EM) robust enough to identify internal cell degradation and abnormal battery behavior? (2) How are the structural simplifications and mathematical order reductions imposed on the EMs and what are their trade-offs? (3) How to apply simplified EM for safer and more efficient battery operation? (4) What are the prospects and obstacles of employing EM-based algorithms in the future? This paper presents a detailed analysis of EM from a modeling and application perspective. The paper introduces battery operating mechanisms, typical failures, and their effects.

In this paper, an effective method is proposed for the detection of islanding in micro-grids. The proposed method employs the concept of potential energy function to drive the islanding detection index. Based on swing and potential energy function equations, an islanding detection criterion is derived based on the rate of change of the potential energy function. The islanding detection index (IDI) takes into account the frequency changes and the rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) of DG. The superiority of the proposed islanding detection method is manifested in the condition where the generation of distributed resources is in balance with the loading consumption. The performance of the proposed method has been evaluated considering the conditions where islanding is difficult to detect or might be mistaken for other phenomena given by loads within the Non-Detection Zone (NDZ) region, different fault types, and loads with different power factors. The performance evaluation has been carried out through simulations and, furthermore, has been compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms. © 2022 The Author(s)","Distributed generation; Islanding; Renewable energy resources","Molecular physics; Potential energy functions; Renewable energy resources; Condition; Detection criteria; Detection scheme; Distribution grid; Frequency changes; Function equations; Islanding; Islanding detection; Microgrid; Rate of change; Distributed power generation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129281295"

Turbine control valves throttle the steam from the steam generator into the steam turbine while maintaining the pressure within the steam generator at a constant set point. Degradation of these components could impact the ability to manage electrical power production. Utilizing the Idaho National Laboratory Hybrid repository and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory TRANSFORM library developed for multi-physics simulation in Dymola/Modelica, an integral pressurized water reactor system was modeled based upon the available specifications of the NuScale Power Module.

Developing models of VRF systems to predict their performance are important for model-based control, fault diagnostic and detection. There are VRF models published in existing literatures, however those models were developed and validated in different datasets. As a result, the model accuracy cannot be directly compared. To fill this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive review of the existing VRF models, and summarizes the input/output parameters and mathematical formulas of 16 VRF models from literature (referred to as physics-based model). Next, we validate and compare the model accuracy of existing models using the same dataset. Additionally, we develop data-driven models using the state-of-art machine learning algorithms, and compare the model accuracy between existing physics-based models with data-driven models. We find the model proposed by Hu et al. in 2019, which regresses the VRF cooling capacity and COP as a linear combination of indoor and outdoor temperatures times a cubed polynomial function of compressor frequency, is the most accurate physics-based model, with a prediction error of 22.19% in the training dataset and 22.44% in the validation dataset. XGBoost is the most accurate data-driven model, with a prediction error of 19.29% in the training dataset and 22.02% in the validation dataset. The data-driven model is more accurate while the physics-based model is more generalizable.

Accurate modeling and simulation of the turbine performance is extremely needed to precisely design a large-watt industrial heavy-duty gas turbine while timely monitoring its performance degradation for fault diagnosis, optimal efficiency and predictive maintenance, which is still very challenging due to the high nonlinearity, system complexity, varying conditions, and strong coupling interaction of high-dimension parameters under the harsh operation environment of the turbine. When ambient conditions change, the major components, such as the compressor, combustor, and turbine often display performance degradation to some degree over operating time so that the performance-based maintenance is needed to maximize the productivity of a gas turbine. Generally, the reliability and effectiveness of performance-based maintenance depends on the real-time efficiency monitoring for timely diagnosis and impending deterioration prognosis for predictive maintenance. In order to improve the reliability and availability of gas turbines at various operating conditions, accurate and efficient simulation of a gas turbine performance provides the fundamental to pursue fault diagnosis and predictive maintenance. This paper presents a new physics informed machine learning methodology to achieve this purpose. The thermodynamic model of a complicated single-shaft gas turbine is first created based on the balances of both flow and power in various subsystems including inlet, compressor, turbine, combustor and exhaust. The characteristic curves of compressor and turbine are utilized to accurately represent the physical mechanism and effectively simulate the high nonlinear behaviors of subsystems. Machine learning based feature extraction are employed to preprocess the multivariate raw data of the turbine. Multilayer artificial neural network models, nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs (NARX) with Bayesian regularization algorithm, are explored to efficiently simulate the start-up transient process of the turbine, thus improve the simulation efficiency and accuracy of the complicated system. Multivariate data collected from a real-world industrial heavy-duty gas turbine is employed to illustrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed methodology. © 2022 Prognostics and Health Management Society.

Inappropriate sensor mounting can lead to loss of fault-related information and generate false alarms in industrial systems. To ensure reliable system operation, in this paper we investigate a system’s multiple degrees-of-freedom (DOF) using the finite element method (FEM) to find the optimum sensor mounting position. An appropriate sensor position is obtained by the highest degree of deformation in FEM modal analysis. The effectiveness of the proper sensor mounting position was compared with two other sensor mounting points, which were selected arbitrarily. To validate the effectiveness of this method we considered a gear-actuator test bench, where the sensors were mounted in the same place as the FEM simulation. Vibration data were acquired through these sensors for different health states of the system and failure patterns were recognized using an artificial neural network (ANN) model. An ANN model shows that the optimum sensor mounting point found in FEM has the highest accuracy, compared to other mounting points. A hybrid CM framework, combining the physics-based and data-driven approaches, provides robust fault detection and identification analysis of the gear-actuator system. © 2022 by the authors.","ANN; condition monitoring; deep learning; finite element method; gear pump","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140928597"

These insulation degradation by-products are discovered in the oil as dissolved impurities. Estimating the concentration of these by-products in the oil allows one to evaluate the condition of an oil-immersed transformer. The two crucial degradation compounds that may be utilised to assess the age of insulation systems or the health state of the transformer are 2-FAL (2-furfuraldehyde) and moisture. Capacitive sensor-based measurement of these degradation compounds, owing to the high dielectric constant, in comparison to that of the pure oil, can detect incipient faults. Early detection of insulation conditions allows preventive maintenance. In this paper, a comb-type capacitive sensor is proposed for 2-FAL and moisture detection.

Although fault decoupling plays a crucial role in locating fault cause and isolating fault components, it still faces challenges due to the harsh reality of common mode failure, networked propagation, and a lack of accurate fault mechanism knowledge in the fault coupling process. A novel physics-data-fusion-based decoupling model for coupled faults of CES was proposed using standard meta components, rigorous formulation, and intuitive representation. First, a hierarchical graph representing the static complex decoupling model was defined by composing proposed meta models. Second, the dynamic model parameters inspired by the time-varying fault characteristics were determined using real-time operation data analysis. Then, based on a proposed numerical reasoning formula, the most likely fault cause was determined, which can also identify fault level by level. Finally, the decoupling model was proved to be reasonable and effective with an offshore wind turbine case. As a graphical modelling method, it handles the decoupling process by fusing static physics and dynamic data of coupled faults. While inheriting the benefits of conventional models, it overcomes the limitations of these existing methods for real-time results. Moreover, the proposed method provided a foundation for tracing the root cause of performance fluctuations, fault detection, and isolation of CES. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","complex electromechanical system; coupled faults; multi-level decoupling model; numerical reasoning; physics-data-fusion; time-varying fault characteristics","Dynamics; Fault detection; Offshore oil well production; Complex electromechanical systems; Coupled fault; Decoupling models; Fault characteristics; Multi-level decoupling model; Multilevels; Numerical reasoning; Physic-data-fusion; Physics data; Time varying; Time-varying fault characteristic; Data fusion","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142305104"

With fast-growing sensing data availability and advancement in computing, computational modeling has demonstrated strong capability to detect and diagnose HVAC system faults, hence, ensuring efficient building operation. This paper comprehensively reviews the state-of-the-art computing-based fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) for HVAC systems. Overall, the reviewed computing-based FDD methods are classified as two major approaches: knowledge-based and data-driven approaches. We then identify multiple important topics, including data availability, training data size, data quality, approach generality, capability, interpretability, and required modeling efforts, along with corresponding metrics to summarize the most updated FDD development. Generally, the knowledge-based approaches are further divided as physics-based modeling, Diagnostic Bayesian Network, and performance indicator-based methods while data-driven approaches include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and regression and statistics-based methods. State-of-the-art FDD development, remaining challenges, and future research directions are further discussed to push forward FDD in practice. Availability of fault data, capability of existing methods to deal with complex fault situations (such as simultaneous faults), modeling interpretability for data-driven methods, and required engineering efforts for physics-based methods are identified as remaining challenges in FDD development. Improving modeling fidelity and reducing modeling efforts are essential for applying physics-based methods in real buildings. Meanwhile, addressing fault data availability, increasing algorithm adaptability, and handling multiple faults are essential to further enhance the applicability of data-driven FDD approaches. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Computing algorithm; Data-driven; Fault detection and diagnosis; Heating; Machine learning; Physics-based modeling; Ventilation and air conditioning systems","Bayesian networks; Buildings; Fault detection; Knowledge based systems; Machine learning; Computing algorithms; Conditioning systems; Data availability; Data driven; Fault detection and diagnosis; Heating ventilation and air conditioning; Machine-learning; Physics-based models; Ventilation and air conditioning; Ventilation and air conditioning system; HVAC","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127487470"

It is an artificially intelligent virtual replica of a real-life cyber-physical system (CPS) useful in all phases of a system’s lifecycle. The Digital Twin is made possible by advances in physics-based modeling and simulation, machine learning (especially, deep learning), virtual/augmented reality, robotics, ubiquitous connectivity, embedded smart sensors, cloud and edge computing, and the ability to crowd source the domain expertise. These technologies have the potential to make Digital Twins anticipate and respond to unforeseen situations, thereby making CPS resilient. To realize resilient CPS, engineers from multiple disciplines, organizations and geographic locations must collaboratively and cohesively work together to conceptualize, design, develop, integrate, manufacture, and operate such systems. The refrain “model once, adapt with data and domain expertise, and use it many times for many different purposes” offers an efficient and versatile approach to render organizational silos extinct. This is accomplished by providing a “single source of the truth” representation of the CPS, to collaborate virtually, assess and forecast in evolving situations, and make adaptive decisions. Organizationally, Digital Twins facilitate situational awareness and effective organizational decision-making through the acquisition, fusion, and transfer of the right models/knowledge/data from the right sources in the right context to the right stakeholder at the right time for the right purpose. That is, the design, manufacturing, optimal operation, monitoring, and proactive maintenance of the CPS. This Chapter addresses the operation of Digital Twins within an enterprise process. The discussion is generally applicable, but illustrated specifically with examples from the Aerospace Industry. It begins with a vision for the enterprise Digital Twin methodology to provide timely and accurate information created during the initial conceptual design, product development, and subsequent operational life cycle phases of the product/system utilizing a comprehensive networking of all related information. All related partners share such information, thereby connecting product/system design, production and usage data with those human and non-human agents requiring this information. The Chapter further reviews the enterprise-wide product lifecycle phases and describes how the use of digital twin methodology allows quasi-static model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) business models to morph into a temporal information continuum, spanning the life cycle of the product or system. Specifically, the focus is on global information flow throughout the enterprise, and suggested DT-committed organizational changes affecting the enterprise. It is followed by a discussion of MBSE-based requirements analysis and platform-based design principles in the product’s conceptual design phase and related examples. This lays the groundwork for encouraging a range of conceptual design ideas, standardizing design, analytical and learning tools for superior coordination and integration of the information flow within the enterprise’s Digital Twin processes. Subsequent portions of the chapter discuss the product development phase via Digital Twin models and platform-based design principles using digital 3-D CPS models with specific examples from Sikorsky and GE as illustrations. An emphasis is placed on the improvement of computing capabilities, such as the introduction of hyper-efficient Graphical Processing Unit (GPU)-based computational capability that provided an order of magnitude improvement in design productivity. Multi-functional causal models are introduced to help uncover failure modes, their propagation paths, and consequent functional effects, and discuss how such digital twin models automatically generate fault trees for risk assessment analysis, and an initial Failure Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) report. The importance of domain knowledge and data-informed models is emphasized in how it can aid in product testing, qualification, and certification phase. A formal system of health modeling to test the severity of candidate faults and their effects to generate an updated FMECA model using the digital twin is also introduced. This enables design engineers to understand the potential faults in the system, their probabilities of occurrence, and their manifestation as functional failures (effects), monitoring mechanisms for making the effects visible, system level implications in terms of safety, customer inconvenience and service/maintenance implications, and so on. The Digital Twin methodology enables the FMECA and fault tree updates in real-time. The role of Digital Twins in product manufacturing, quality management and distribution phase is addressed next. It includes a description of an integrated process for additive manufacturing and an advanced 3D quality inspection process. The DT network links these highly accurate coordinate measurement processes with the complex 3D Cyber-physical models intended to define the product accurately. As part of the Digital Twin, an integrated on-board and off-board system health management, coupled with virtual/augmented reality, can improve customer experience and support via real-time monitoring, incipient failure detection, root cause analysis, prognostics, predictive maintenance, and training assessment. The S-92 helicopter’s data integration process serves as a constructive example of how a proactive digital twin-aided health management system can significantly improve product resilience, safety, and customer acceptance. The remaining portions of the chapter describe how the Digital Twin infrastructure’s ability to process enormous amounts of data into information and knowledge, aided by the Failure Reporting, Analysis and Corrective Action System (FRACAS) database, enables proactive product configuration management and active learning. The result is efficient product maturation and customer adaptation. The Digital Twin’s ability to support the design of environmentally sustainable products and how they can eventually be suitably disposed is also addressed. The successful adoption of Digital Twins has other consequences, including the need to revamp traditional organizational structures to be effective in a globalized environment. While Digital Twins offer great promise, it is also important to consider some cautionary thoughts on the need for accurate models, domain knowledge-informed machine learning, and awareness of human fallacies in implementing the Digital Twin methodology. Finally, in a business environment, commitment to the Digital Twin methodology hinges on an understanding of the value that Digital Twins provide and the steps that the enterprise must take to successfully adopt the methodology. The enterprise must accept significant structural and cultural changes to succeed with a DT methodology. The authors firmly counsel that adaptation of these necessary enterprise modifications will not be easy and, as such, will require top-down leadership to respond to structural and cultural changes with the necessary corporate resources (adequate and digitally literate staff, leadership, hardware-software computing and communication infrastructure, and budget). © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.","Aerospace; Computing; Digital design; Digital inspection; Digital manufacturing; Digital thread; Digital transformation; Digital Twin; Enterprise; Model-based design and systems engineering; Multi-domain modeling; Multi-functional causal models; Product development; Product lifecycle; Prognostics/diagnostics; Simulation; System health management","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170195559"

The virtual EMA provides the near real-time representation of the physical EMA. It offers the potential to optimize operations and maintenance and further accelerates the new product development process. The virtual EMA enables degradations detection, What-If simulations, RUL estimations, KPIs trending, etc. The degradation tracking performance of the digital twin was evaluated using a test stand with real EMA and seeded faults (partial winding short). The results indicate that this approach can be used for the monitoring of EMA degradations.

Therefore, it is important to detect and troubleshoot problems in HVAC systems timely. Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) techniques can help with HVAC monitoring and optimizing system performance for efficient use of energy. In this paper, we demonstrate how to create efficient fault detectors using physics-based modeling and machine learning. We show how to build a simulation model of a hotel building, which we then use to sample augmented data with typical faults commonly found in HVAC systems.

While such data contain rich features that can potentially reflect the underlying fault conditions, direct inverse analysis of machinery faults using first-principle modelling is still not feasible, since such model would encompass multiple time and length-scales. Feature extraction through signal processing and more recently through machine learning is the main approach, aiming at establishing the causative relation between fault conditions and specific response features. Traditional signal processing methods reply on empirical experiences and thus may not be generalizable. On the other hand, while deep learning utilizing raw data without going through signal pre-processing has shown promising aspects, it generally requires very large amount of training data and the results may not be easily interpreted. Indeed, deep learning models are generally data-intensive, and therefore non-generative data augmentation by geometric transformation but pertaining entire raw information is preferred. However, feeding the raw information repetitively in a different way does not ensure more relevant features to be captured. In this research, we investigate a new methodology of feature aggregation through a multi-branch neural network architecture. Specifically, one branch of the neural network is fed with the raw vibration data that goes through automated feature extraction through deep learning, and another branch is fed with physics-based signal pre-processing. This architecture can fuse together physics knowledge of the vibration with the hidden features embedded in the raw data, thereby reducing the demand on training data size. Moreover, this parallel architecture can directly assist the interpretation of the decision making as the physics-based signal pre-processing is involved. © 2023 Proceedings of the International Congress on Sound and Vibration.

To avoid severe safety issues (e.g., thermal runaway), initial faults should be timely detected and resolved. In this paper, we consider parallel-connected battery cells with only one voltage and one current sensor. The lack of independent current sensors makes it difficult to detect individual cell degradation. To this end, based on the high-frequency response of the battery, a simplified fault detection-oriented model is derived and validated by a physics-informed battery model. The resistance of the battery string, which is significantly influenced by the faulty cell, is estimated and used as the health indicator. The statistical resistance distribution of battery strings is first analyzed considering the distribution of fresh and aged cells. A fault diagnosis algorithm is proposed and the thresholds (i.e., 2 standard deviation interval) are obtained through statistical analysis. Monte Carlo simulation results show that the proposed fault diagnosis algorithm can balance false alarms and missed detections well. In addition, it is verified that the proposed algorithm is robust to the uniform parameter changes of individual battery cells. © 2020 AACC.","","Battery management systems; Failure analysis; Frequency response; Learning algorithms; Lithium-ion batteries; Monte Carlo methods; Diagnosis algorithms; High frequency response; Missed detections; Parallel-connected; Parameter changes; Resistance distribution; Standard deviation; Statistical modeling; Fault detection","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089577336"

However, planetary gearbox fault diagnosis remains a challenge due to complex responses caused by multiple planetary gears. Model-based gearbox fault diagnosis techniques extract hand-crafted features from sensor data based on underlying physics and statistical analysis, which are not effective in extracting spatial and temporal features automatically. While deep learning methods such as convolutional neural network (CNN) enable automatic feature extraction from multiple sensor sources, they are not capable of extracting spatial and temporal features simultaneously without losing critical feature information. To address this issue, we introduce a novel deep neural network based on bidirectional-convolutional long short-term memory (BiConvLSTM) networks to determine the type, location, and direction of planetary gearbox faults by extracting spatial and temporal features from both vibration and rotational speed measurements automatically and simultaneously. In particular, a CNN determines spatial correlations between two measurements within one time step automatically by combining signals collected from three accelerometers and one tachometer. Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks identify temporal dependencies between two adjacent time steps. By replacing input-to-state and state-to-state operations in the LSTM cell with convolutional operations, the BiConvLSTM can learn spatial correlations and temporal dependencies without losing critical features. Experimental results have shown that the BiConvLSTM network can detect the type, location, and direction of gearbox faults with higher accuracy than conventional deep learning approaches such as CNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Deep learning; Fault diagnosis; Planetary gearbox; Spatiotemporal feature","Brain; Convolution; Deep neural networks; Electric fault currents; Fault detection; Feature extraction; Gears; Long short-term memory; Statistical Physics; Convolutional neural network; Critical features; Deep learning; Faults diagnosis; Memory network; Planetary gearboxes; Short term memory; Spatial features; Spatio temporal features; Temporal features; Failure analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111054020"

Using finite element analysis software, a multi-physics finite element model of transformer electrical-magnetic-structural force-sound field is established, and multi-physics transient simulation analysis is carried out for three working conditions of transformer normal state, winding deformation and iron core deformation. And the transformer fault diagnosis algorithm based on the similarity of feature matrix is used to analyze the similarity of the noise signal between the fault and the normal working condition of the transformer. The research results show that there are obvious differences in the noise distribution of the noise signal in the solution domain of the transformer under different working conditions. The noise signal generated by the vibration of the transformer during normal operation presents a symmetrical distribution trend, and the noise radiated when the winding and the iron core are deformed is obvious. Asymmetric distribution; the proposed transformer fault diagnosis algorithm can comprehensively realize transformer fault identification of multiple groups of noise signals and different measuring points, and identify transformer faults combined with noise distribution map. © 2022 IEEE.","fault identification; mult-physical; noisy signal; transformer","Acoustic fields; Computer software; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Finite element method; Iron; Learning algorithms; Transformer windings; Condition; Fault identifications; Iron cores; Mult-physical; Multi-physics; Noise signals; Noisy signals; Transformer; Transformer fault diagnosis; Transformer faults; Winding","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160202503"

It is desired to detect and avoid chatter on-line without false alarms for improved productivity. This paper presents the application of a combined machine learning network and physics-based model to detect chatter in milling. The vibration data collected during machining is converted into moving short-time frequency spectrums, whose features are mapped to five machining states as air cut, entry into and exit from the workpiece, stable cut, and chatter conditions. The machine learning network was trained and its architecture was reduced to a computationally optimal network with 3 convolution blocks followed by a neural network with one hidden layer. A parallel algorithm, which Kalman filters the stable forced vibrations to isolate chatter signals in raw data, is used to detect the chatter and its frequency. The combination of the machine learning and physics-based model led to a 98.90% success rate in chatter detection while allowing to further train the network during production with the help of the physics-based, deterministic model. © 2021 CIRP","Chatter; Fault detection; Machine learning; Machine tool; Machining; Vibration","E-learning; Milling (machining); Multilayer neural networks; Detect and avoid; Deterministic modeling; Forced vibration; Hybrid machine learning; ITS architecture; Physics-based modeling; Surface finishes; Time-frequency spectrum; Machine learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107089995"

Rather than univariate alerts, fault detection and diagnostics focus on abnormal situations, which is crucial for maintaining optimum operating conditions and anticipating chemical process hazards. Model-based and process history-based fault detection and diagnosis are the two types of fault detection and diagnosis, with the second being more commonly referred to as data-based. Model-based methods are often based on a fundamental grasp of the process's physics.

In this study to overcome these bottlenecks, a dynamic approach based on dynamic event tree (DET) is applied to calculate the CDF for the station blackout (SBO) accident in VVER-1000/V446 nuclear reactor. To implement the DET, deterministic and probabilistic models are developed using the plant data and the characteristics of the SBO accident. These models are then run simultaneously to investigate the time of operator actions, AC power supply recovery, and the availability of safety systems on the accident progression and consequences.

Estimates suggest that between 5% and 30% of any building's annual energy consumption is unknowingly wasted due to pathologically malfunctioning lighting and comfort conditioning systems. In order to target various anomalies in different component of a HVAC system, a component level model of the HVAC system is needed. As one of the necessary steps in developing this general framework for fault detection of a cooling system in a commercial building, the energy modeling of a crossflow cooling tower was targeted. This warranted a detailed physical model for a cooling tower based on first principle physics. A cooling tower model was built based on physical thermodynamics and heat and mass transfer principles using the effectiveness-NTU method for heat exchanger performance. The focus of the model was to use non-intrusive measurements and predict the exiting water temperature from the cooling tower given certain inputs. Compared with the existing models, the new model has two main advantages: (1) As an engineering model, it is formulated while taking into consideration an engineering perspective and involves fewer input variables and has an intuitive description of the cooling tower operation; (2) There is no iterative computation required and therefore is very easy to use for online optimization. The focus of the modeling was not to get the most accurate measurements, but rather to help in the aid of developing a system level cooling tower model which could be used as a part of an optimization framework for overall building energy consumption. With this goal, the model was still able to predict the results accurately within 10% when compared with the results from field experiments. The model uses readily available inputs like temperatures of the water entering and exiting the cooling tower, airflow rate of the multiple fans in the cooling tower and the ambient weather conditions. The model was validated with data from a cooling tower that was operating for around one month. The data was collected from a cooling tower satisfying the needs of a large commercial hospital building in Spain. The results from the model show that the model agrees with the experimental measurements within 10%. The model validation and results from a case-study are presented in this work. © 2021 Begell House Inc..

In this manuscript, a three-dimensional multiphysics model was established and simulated to research the characteristics of the propagation in the transformer wall. Furthermore, a piezoelectric transducer was used to detect PD ultrasonic signals and verify the simulation results in the laboratory. To ensure the accuracy of the detection, an optical fiber sensor based on the Sagnac interference principle was designed and adopted. The variation of the amplitude of the ultrasonic signal with distance reveals the characteristics of the ultrasonic signal propagating in the transformer wall. The distribution of sound pressure on the upper and lower surfaces of the simulation model proved that ultrasonic waves propagate in the form of symmetrical Lamb waves in the transformer wall. Moreover, the amplitude of the AE attenuates due to absorption and refraction loss, and local fluctuations on account of acoustic interference. Thus, a stable signal detected by an AE sensor does not represent the absence of PD in a transformer. To improve the reliability of AE detection, it is proposed in this manuscript that repeated movement of the AE sensor is necessary to obtain a suitable measurement position. Similarly, it is necessary to adjust the position of the AE sensor in order to locate the PD source well. In addition, this study is expected to provide a theoretical analysis and a fiber sensor to address the problem of sensor placement in AE detection. © 2019 Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences and IOP Publishing.","optical fiber; partial discharge; power transformer; Sagnac interference; ultrasonic detection","Acoustic emission testing; Acoustic wave propagation; Optical fibers; Partial discharges; Power transformers; Signal interference; Surface waves; Ultrasonic testing; Ultrasonic waves; Insulation fault; Local fluctuations; Measurement positions; Multi-physics modeling; Sensor placement; Simulation model; Ultrasonic detection; Ultrasonic signals; Signal detection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85080097855"

One example of a particularly pernicious attack vector is the spoofing or replaying of a fault event using one or more compromised PMUs. This work documents the development and validation of a coherency-based cyberattack detection algorithm that integrates a sliding-window singular value decomposition (SVD) with physics-based partitioning analysis to achieve accurate classification of events. Special consideration is given to discerning a sophisticated fault-replay or fault spoofing attack from actual faults. A software-based cybersecurity testbed has been developed for rigorous testing of the algorithm. The algorithm is further validated using simulated synchrophasor datasets obtained from a MinniWECC 63-bus test system.

Additionally, there is a need to reduce unnecessary energy consumption while increasing occupant health in buildings via implementation of manual fault detection with available building design programs. However, a common problem with the current lineup of programs is that they require extensive inputs for material properties and usage loads; this results in spending extensive amounts of time performing model calibration and having to adjust multiple values (sometimes hundreds) to bring a model in alignment with actual building use. However, a simplified physics-based model (SPBM) can achieve a level of modeling accuracy sufficient for automatic fault detection with as few as ten automatically calibrated unknown parameters. Obviously, other simplified building energy models exist; however, these often rely on ignoring important details, such as humidity, CO2, and per-hour performance, or implement averaged numerical estimations. Due to the limitations of current modeling programs, some development has begun on rule-based and component-based fault detection by several companies and researchers. While component-based fault detection is effective, it relies on accurate sensor readings and does not account for actual building performance. A suitable rigorous physics-based model has not been developed for the purpose of fault detection. Therefore, by comparing the accuracy of an automatically calibrated SPBM with real-world building performance and high-fidelity building energy models will provide baseline knowledge about if such a model can even achieve a high enough level of fidelity to reliably represent the complexity of a building.

The limitations of renewable energy sources, however, require flexible energy production sources to supplement them. Micro gas turbine based combined heat and power plants, which are used for domestic applications, can fill this gap if they become more reliable. This can be achieved with the use of an engine monitoring and diagnostics system: real-time engine condition monitoring and fault diagnostics results in reduced operating and maintenance costs and increased component and engine life. In order to allow the step change in the connection of small engines to the grid, a fleet monitoring system for micro gas turbines is required. A proposed framework combines a physics-based model and a data-driven model with machine learning capabilities for predicting system behavior, and includes a purpose-developed diagnostic tool for anomaly detection and classification for a multitude of engines. The framework has been implemented on a fleet of micro gas turbines and some of the lessons learned from the demonstration of the concept as well as key takeaways from the general literature are presented in this paper. The extension of fleet monitoring to optimal operation and production planning in relation to the needs of the grid will allow the micro gas turbines to fit in the future green energy system, connect to the grid, and trade in the energy market. The requirements on the system level for the widespread use of micro gas turbines in the energy system are addressed in the paper. A review of the current solutions in fleet monitoring and diagnostics, generally developed for larger engines, is included, with an outlook into a sustainable future. © Copyright © 2021 Aslanidou, Rahman, Zaccaria and Kyprianidis.","automation; diagnostics; fleet monitoring; micro gas turbine; predictive maintenance; production planning; smart energy system","Alternative fuels; Anomaly detection; Commerce; Condition monitoring; Gas plants; Gas turbines; Gases; Plants (botany); Production control; Diagnostic; Energy generations; Fleet monitoring; Green energy; Micro gas turbine; Micro-gas; Monitoring system; Predictive maintenance; Production Planning; Smart energy systems; Renewable energy resources","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107948867"

A multitude of monitoring and diagnostic systems were developed and tested in the last few decades. The current computational capability of modern digital systems was exploited for both accurate physics-based methods and artificial intelligence or machine learning methods. However, progress is rather limited and none of the methods explored so far seem to be superior to others. One solution to enhance diagnostic systems exploiting the advantages of various techniques is to fuse the information coming from different tools, for example, through statistical methods. Information fusion techniques such as Bayesian networks, fuzzy logic, or probabilistic neural networks can be used to implement a decision support system. This paper presents a comprehensive review of information and decision fusion methods applied to gas turbine diagnostics and the use of probabilistic reasoning to enhance diagnostic accuracy. The different solutions presented in the literature are compared, and major challenges for practical implementation on an industrial gas turbine are discussed. Detecting and isolating faults in a system is a complex problem with many uncertainties, including the integrity of available information. The capability of different information fusion techniques to deal with uncertainty are also compared and discussed.

It is essential to efficiently monitor short-term voltage stability in real-time by detailed data analytics on voltage measurements acquired from phasor measurement units (PMUs). It is likewise critical to identify the location of faults resulting in short-term voltage stability issues for effective remedial actions. This paper proposes a time-series deep learning framework using 1D-convolutional neural networks (1D-CNN) for real-time short-term voltage stability assessment (STVSA), which relies on a limited number of phasor measurement units (PMU) voltage samples. A two-stage STVSA application is proposed. The first stage comprises a 1D-CNN-based fast voltage collapse detector. The second stage comprises of 1D-CNN-based regressor to quantify the severity of the short-term voltage stability event. Two novel indices are presented, and their predicted future values are used to quantify the severity of short-term voltage stability events. This work also considers DB-SCAN clustering-based fault detection and physics-based fault localization for effective short-term voltage stability assessment and remedial actions by identifying the most critical PMUs. A bad data pre-processing technique is also included to mitigate the impact of missing data and outliers on short-term voltage stability assessment accuracy. The proposed framework is validated using the standard IEEE test systems and compared against other machine learning models to demonstrate the superiority of 1D-CNN-based time-series deep learning for short-term voltage stability assessment. © 2013 IEEE.","1D-convolution NN; data-anomalies; deep learning; short-term voltage stability; Time-series","Air conditioning; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Data Analytics; Data handling; Deep learning; Fault detection; Induction motors; Phase measurement; Phasor measurement units; Time series; Fast voltage collapse; Fault localization; IEEE test systems; Learning frameworks; Location of fault; Machine learning models; Phasor measurement unit (PMUs); Short-term voltage stability; System stability","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113865600"

It is based upon the assumption that an earthquake is not fully related to any other one in particular, but rather to both all previous events, and the background seismicity. The close temporal proximity of the strong (M ≥ 6.0) events in the study area offers the opportunity to retrospectively test the validity of the ETAS model through the 2014 Kefalonia doublet (Mw 6.1 and Mw 6.0) and the 2015 Lefkada aftershock sequences. The application of a physics-based earthquake simulator to the local fault system produced a simulated catalogue with time, space and magnitude behaviour in line with the observed seismicity. This catalogue is then used for the detection of short-term interactions between both strong and smaller events and the comparison between the two cases. The results show that the suggested clustering model provides reliable forecasts of the aftershock activity. Combining the ETAS model and the simulator code, though, needs to be more deeply examined since the preliminary results show some discrepancy between the estimated model parameters. © 2019 Oxford University Press.

Objective: We profile fault identification and diagnosis techniques employed in the aerospace, automotive, and industrial control domains. Each of these sectors has adopted particular methods to meet their differing diagnostic needs. By examining both theoretical presentations as well as case studies from production environments, we present a profile of the current approaches being employed and identify gaps. Methodology: A scoping study was used to identify and compare fault detection and diagnosis methodologies that are presented in the current literature. We created categories for the different diagnostic approaches via a pilot study and present an analysis of the trends that emerged. We then compared the maturity of these approaches by adapting and using the NASA Technology Readiness Level (TRL) scale. Results: Fault identification and analysis studies from 127 papers published from 2004 to 2019 reveal a wide diversity of promising techniques, both emerging and in-use. These range from traditional Physics-based Models to Data-Driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Knowledge-Based approaches. Hybrid techniques that blend aspects of these three broad categories were also encountered. Predictive diagnostics or prognostics featured prominently across all sectors, along with discussions of techniques including Fault trees, Petri nets and Markov approaches. We also profile some of the techniques that have reached the highest Technology Readiness Levels, showing how those methods are being applied in real-world environments beyond the laboratory. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the continuing wide use of both Model-Based and Data-Driven AI techniques across all domains, especially when they are used together in hybrid configuration, reflects the complexity of the current ICPS application space. While creating sufficiently-complete models is labor intensive, Model-free AI techniques were evidenced as a viable way of addressing aspects of this challenge, demonstrating the increasing sophistication of current machine learning systems. Connecting ICPS together to share sufficient telemetry to diagnose and manage faults is difficult when the physical environment places demands on ICPS. Despite these challenges, the most mature papers present robust fault diagnosis and analysis techniques which have moved beyond the laboratory and are proving valuable in real-world environments. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Aerospace; Automotive; Avionics; Faults; Industrial control; Industrial cyber–physical systems","Accident prevention; Artificial intelligence; Electric fault currents; Knowledge based systems; Learning systems; NASA; Petri nets; Space applications; Fault detection and diagnosis; Hybrid configurations; Knowledge-based approach; Predictive diagnostics; Production environments; Real world environments; Robust fault diagnosis; Technology readiness levels; Fault detection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084943715"

In the last decade, deep-learning methods have received a great deal of attention in many application domains, including object recognition and computer vision. Recently, there has been a rapid rise in the use of convolutional neural networks for rotating machinery diagnostics inspired by their powerful feature learning and classification capability. However, the application in the field of gas turbine diagnostics is still limited. This paper presents a gas turbine fault detection and isolation method using modular convolutional neural networks preceded by a physics-driven performance-trend-monitoring system. The trend-monitoring system was employed to capture performance changes due to degradation, establish a new baseline when it is needed, and generatefault signatures. The fault detection and isolation system was trained to step-by-step detect and classify gas path faults to the component level using fault signatures obtained from the physics part. The performance of the method proposed was evaluated based on different fault scenarios for a three-shaft turbofan engine, under significant measurement noise to ensure model robustness. Two comparative assessments were also carried out: with a single convolutional-neural-network-architecture-based fault classification method and with a deep long short-term memory-assisted fault detection and isolation method. The results obtained revealed the performance of the proposed method to detect and isolate multiple gas path faults with over 96% accuracy. Moreover, sharing diagnostic tasks with modular architectures is seen as relevant to significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy. © 2021 by the authors.

A key issue of interest is how the inputs to CNNs that contain fault-related patterns are learned by CNNs to recognize discriminatory information for fault diagnosis. Understanding this link will help establish connection to the physical meaning of the diagnosis, contributing to the broad acceptance of CNNs as a trustworthy complement to physics-based reasoning by human experts. Using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) as an indicator, this paper investigates the performance of a CNN trained by time-frequency spectra images of vibration signals measured on an induction motor. The LRP provides pixel-level representation of which values in the input signal contribute the most to the diagnosis results, thereby providing an improved understanding of how the CNN learns to distinguish between fault types from these inputs. Results have shown that the patterns learned by CNNs in the time-frequency spectra images are intuitive and consistent with respect to network re-training. Comparison with using raw time series and discrete Fourier transform coefficients as inputs reveals that time-frequency images allow for more consistent pattern recognition by CNNs. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","convolutional neural network; layer-wise relevance propagation; Motor fault diagnosis","Backpropagation; Clustering algorithms; Convolution; Discrete Fourier transforms; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Fourier series; Induction motors; Multilayer neural networks; Network layers; Pattern recognition; Spectroscopy; High dimensional data; Layer-wise; Machine fault diagnosis; Motor fault; Pattern recognition techniques; Performance degradation; Physical meanings; Time-frequency images; Convolutional neural networks","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081102939"

Taking the winding current, winding hot spot temperature and oil temperature into consideration, a new approach based on the fusion analysis of electrothermal characteristics is proposed to detect the interturn faults in the winding of an oil-immersed transformer. The main idea of the proposed method is to establish the digital space model of the physical transformer with the digital twin technology. Then, multi-physics simulation is used to derive the changing law of the electrothermal characteristics of the transformers under different operation conditions and interturn fault types in the digital space. With the main electrothermal characteristics parameters including winding current and hot spot temperature as the features, a twin fault sample based data-driven model is presented for the interturn fault detection. A case study is carried out on the 31.5MVA/110kV power transformer.

However, it is difficult to directly monitor the looseness of the fixing bolts online. The tightening torque of the fixing bolt directly reflects the looseness of the bolt. A novel quantitative indirect measurement method of tightening torque employing temperature rise, operation current, and structure and material parameters as direct measurement is proposed in this article. Based on the proposed physical model of the connection between the tightening torque, the temperature rise and the operation current of the linear connection unit, a magnetic-electric-thermal multiphysics coupling model of WPDBT is established. The bolt tightening torque can be directly calculated from the temperature rise and the operation current by the physical model presented in this article. To further demonstrate the accuracy of the method and achieve online monitoring of structural health, an online monitoring system for fault diagnosis of the linear connection unit of WPDBT is designed based on this physical model. The online monitoring system was applied to an experimental platform for WPDBT. The effectiveness of the method proposed in this article is further verified. It is proven that the temperature rise and operation current of the linear connection unit can indirectly measure the looseness of the fixing bolts. Finally, a method of structural health assessment for WPDBT is given. The new approach opens the way for real-time monitoring the structural health for WPDBT.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Contact resistance; multiphysics coupling model; structural health on-line monitoring; tightening torque; wind power dedicated busbar trunking (WPDBT)","Bolts; Busbars; Electric fault currents; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Structural health monitoring; Torque; Voltage measurement; Wind power; Wind turbines; Busbar trunking; Coupling models; Multi-physic coupling model; Multi-physics couplings; Online monitoring; Structural health; Structural health on-line monitoring; Tightening torque; Wind power dedicated busbar trunking; Wind power generation; Temperature measurement","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139433512"

Such analytical tools, referred to as anomaly detection techniques, rely on features extracted from data that describe the underlying physical process. While these anomaly detection systems may work well with simulated data, their real-world applications are often hindered by the presence of noise. In some cases, noise may obscure subtle anomalies that may carry information about incipient stages of system faults. These subtle variations may also be the result of malicious intrusion such as so-called false data injection attack, equipment degradation causing sensor drift, or other natural disturbances in the process or the sensors. Consequently, there is a need to extract features that are robust to noise and also denoise data in a manner that aids machine-learning (ML) tools in diagnostics. In this regard, this paper presents a singular value decomposition–based statistical data–driven approach for feature extraction, denoted by randomized window decomposition, to capture the underlying physics of the system. Additionally, the features are used to denoise data to reveal subtle anomalies while also preserving relevant information for ML algorithms. The denoising algorithm is demonstrated using a RELAP5 simulation of a representative nuclear reactor with virtual noise. © 2022 American Nuclear Society.","anomaly detection; feature engineering; filtering; Passive monitoring","Anomaly detection; Data mining; Nuclear reactors; Singular value decomposition; Analytical tool; Anomaly detection; Artificial intelligence techniques; De-Noise; De-noising algorithm; Digitisation; Feature engineerings; Industrial systems; Passive monitoring; Predictive maintenance; Feature extraction","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126488304"

For this purpose, a fault classification model has been developed for plunger lift systems using neural networks focused on production loss detection. With the use of this tool, the aim is to reduce 10% of undetected production losses and increase production by 10%, improve the allocation of resources in the field, reduce the intervention of slickline equipment and improve the opportunities for multidisciplinary work between production engineers, data science specialists and automation specialists, so that an integrated solution can be obtained using data physics, prescriptive analysis and automation models. The conceptualization of this proposal started by defining the different types of failure that are responsible for production losses or optimization opportunities applicable to wells with Plunger Lift. Time series techniques were used to compare and isolate failure patterns available in historical head pressure data. The patterns were subsequently converted to images and those images corresponding to failures later classified using neural networks. Finally, an interdisciplinary team of data scientists, production engineers, and optimizers, identified and proposed the actions to solve each group of failures. 3000 images corresponding to failures were collected and used to train the classifier, obtaining an accuracy of 80% in the identification of new events. Due to the large number of wells in the field (around 400), this classifier has been built on the principle of wells performance control by handling through exception, as otherwise it would unpractical to analyze the totality of events occurring daily. Thus, this tool has proved to be of great help in reducing study times by focusing primary on those wells that are impairing production and later on those which might still be optimized, aiming at the end of the process achieving operational excellence by maximizing production across all wells to their expected potential. The project also highlights YPF´s leading business approach by promoting the concept of multidisciplinary collaborative spaces by merging specialists from Experience Center Data Scientist and production Engineering Sector. This convergence provides a considerable improvement to an economical and profitable extraction system for unconventional wells. The identification of failures in the Plunger Lift extraction system presented in this work consists of an extension of information that is already in the literature, however, the use of machine data driven models coupled with a classifier tool which optimizes actions using a risk approach based on production losses to identify and solve these types of failures is considered a novel instrument.

The DC arc can not be extinguished naturally because of no zero-crossing current/voltage so that it may cause device damage or fire. It is important to study DC arc properties for the detection of arc faults and safety protection for electrical appliances. Light spectral test data indicate the presence of copper particle in the arc. Therefore, conductivity-temperature characteristic curves of air containing copper vapor medium is proposed based on the equilibrium plasma theory. Meanwhile, a finite element model of small current air DC arc is built, then the temperature field distribution and the relationship between arc resistance and electrode spacing are obtained. By comparing experimental data and the simulation results, we find that the simulation data are much closer to experimental data when copper vapor is considered than that with pure air medium. When the arc burns stably, both the multi-physics field simulation and the experimental test show the similar temperature field distribution along two electrodes, in addition, the maximum gas temperature of plasma reaches 6 000 K~7 500K. The maximum deviation of arc resistance, versus electrode distance, between the simulation and experiment data is 2.283Ω, namely the relative error is 13.45%. Therefore, the arc simulation model considering copper vapor medium is more rational to study the conductivity properties of DC arc.

Its basic idea is to mimic the general intelligence of human experts in understanding massive amounts of operational data of various buildings, and further proposing customized fault detection solutions. A domain ontology is developed to allow computers to understand the prior knowledge of building energy systems fault detection. Classes and properties are developed to formalize all possible configurations in this domain. Semantic rules are proposed to detect the operation problems, control problems, equipment malfunction and sensor failure in building energy systems. These rules are written in abstract syntax. They can be reused in various building energy systems. For a target system, the building data are mapped to the ontology to generate a customized knowledge graph. The knowledge graph captures the physics underlying the system operations. The semantic rules are activated based on the knowledge graph to detect the faults. The proposed approach is demonstrated using the historical data from an industrial building located in Wuhan, China. The results show that the approach is powerful in providing the customized fault detection solutions for different situations. It has high levels of interpretability, reliability and automation. The knowledge graph is automatically updated with new data step by step. The semantic rules are activated if the conditions are satisfied based on the knowledge graph. The fault action mechanisms are captured based on the inference chains of the rules.

From this perspective, continuous monitoring of engine performance is essential to implement proper corrective actions and avoid excessive fuel consumption due to engine deterioration. This requires, however, automated systems for diagnostics and decision support, which should be able to handle large amounts of data and ensure reliability in all the multiple conditions the engines of a fleet can be found in. In particular, the proposed solution should be robust to engine-to-engine deviations and dierent sensors availability scenarios. In this paper, a probabilistic Bayesian network for fault detection and identification is applied to a fleet of engines, simulated by an adaptive performance model. The combination of the performance model and the Bayesian network is also studied and compared to the probabilistic model only. The benefit in the suggested hybrid approach is identified as up to 50% higher accuracy.

While these solutions must ideally be able to predict transient conditions, in particular real time DC temperatures, existing forecasting methods are inadequate because they (1) make restrictive assumptions about system configurations, (2) are extremely time-consuming for real time applications, (3) are accurate only over limited time horizons, (4) fail to accurately model the effects of operating conditions, such as cooling unit operation conditions and server workloads, or (5) ignore important facets of the flow physics and heat transfer that can lead to large prediction errors in extrapolative predictions. To address these deficiencies, we develop a gray-box model that combines machine learning with the thermofluid transport equations relevant for a row-based cooled DC to predict transient temperatures in server CPUs and cold air inlet to the servers. An artificial neural network (ANN) embedded in the gray-box model predicts pressures, which provide inputs for the thermofluid transport equations that predict the spatio-temporal temperature distributions. The model is validated with experimental measurements for different (1) server workload distributions, (2) cooling unit set-point temperatures and (3) the airflow of the cooling units. This gray-box model exhibits superior performance compared to a conventional zonal temperature prediction model and an advanced black-box model that is based on a nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model.

Solutions aiming to reduce maintenance costs and production losses due to unplanned downtimes were brought to market. These solutions provide with a model of the equipment in healthy conditions using machine learning techniques applied on historical data. During operation a warning is issued when expected and actual measurements do not match. Although these solutions have proven their value to detect abnormal behaviors, they generate a large number of alarms that require resource to be analyzed. Moreover, these solutions rely on a large number of sensors that need to work correctly both for the learning and the monitoring phase. This generates additional maintenance even though these sensors are often not essential to operate the machine. Lastly the solutions are expensive: their application is usually limited to critical machines with risks of production loss. Indeed, they are not economic for a Transmission System Operator that has ensured the availability of its network with redundancy. The objective of the authors was to focus on the monitoring of radial vibrations of centrifugal compressors. Experience proves this is one of the most critical data for early fault detection. The goal was to develop a smart modelling based on historical data using essential parameters influencing rotor-dynamics. As a result, a clear correlation was found between the operating point and the vibration level. That can be easily shown on a centrifugal compressor map. A second-degree polynomial equation was successfully tested. The model equation relies only on two compressor physics parameters: flow coefficient and speed. We discuss in the paper the impact of other essential parameters. The method has been applied on different type of centrifugal compressors, with different bearing technology (magnetic...) or shaft driving equipment (gas turbine, electric motor drive). A fault detection case study using this method is described, eg: vibration variation due to abnormal opening of an anti-surge control valve. In conclusion this method is a simple alternative to usual condition monitoring solutions. Similarly to what was described in the GT2014-25242 for a Predictive Emission Monitoring System [1], equations based on physical parameters prove to be an efficient modelling technique. Moreover, it helps monitoring teams to better understand the underlying relation between parameters. Indeed, to achieve a complete monitoring of a centrifugal compressor health, this method can be combined with first-principle performance models that use the same physical parameters.

While existing deep learning approaches are able to efficiently detect and classify bearing faults, most of these approaches depend exclusively on data and do not incorporate physical knowledge into the learning and prediction processes—or more importantly, embed the physical knowledge of bearing faults into the model training process, which makes the model physically meaningful. To address this challenge, we propose a physics-informed deep learning approach that consists of a simple threshold model and a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model for bearing fault detection. In the proposed physics-informed deep learning approach, the threshold model first assesses the health classes of bearings based on known physics of bearing faults. Then, the CNN model automatically extracts high-level characteristic features from the input data and makes full use of these features to predict the health class of a bearing. We designed a loss function for training and validating the CNN model that selectively amplifies the effect of the physical knowledge assimilated by the threshold model when embedding this knowledge into the CNN model. The proposed physics-informed deep learning approach was validated using (1) data from 18 bearings on an agricultural machine operating in the field, and (2) data from bearings on a laboratory test stand in the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) Bearing Data Center. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Bearing; Deep learning; Fault detection; Health monitoring; Physical knowledge","Bearings (structural); Condition monitoring; Deep neural networks; Fault detection; Bearing; Bearing fault; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Faults detection; Health monitoring; Learning approach; Neural network modelling; Physical knowledge; Threshold modeling; Health","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106266134"

In the upstream field, it introduces how to combine digital rock physics with big data and AI to optimize recovery efficiency. Digital core (also known as digital petrophysics—DRP) technology enables more reliable physical information about pore-scale multiphase flows to determine the cause of low recovery and provides new ways for different injection solutions to improve reservoir performance. Combined with digital rock technology and AI, we can integrate the characteristics of digital rock databases into logging and well data, and use a variety of advanced classification techniques to identify the remaining oil and gas potential. Through the multi-phase flow simulation, the multi-scale model can predict the best injection method for maximum recovery under different conditions and propose possible solutions to optimize crude oil production. In the downstream field, the application of AI and big data analysis in planning and scheduling systems, process unit optimization, preventive maintenance of equipment, and other aspects is introduced. Among them, the molecular-level advanced planning and scheduling system (MAPS) can realize the cost performance measurement under different production schemes for potential types of processable crude oil, which is conducive to more accurate selection of crude oil and prediction of crude oil properties. In addition, the whole process simulation can be used to understand the product quality changes under different crude oil blending schemes and different unit operating conditions, which is conducive to timely adjusting the product blending schemes according to economic benefits or ex-factory demands. The operation conditions of secondary units and even the properties of mixed crude oil can be deduced according to different product quality requirements. In the process of optimization, the Continuous Catalytic Reforming (CCR) unit in the refinery process, for example, introduces the application of large data analysis, including correlation analysis, single index detection, multidimensional data anomaly detection, and the parameters of the single objective optimization, a multi-objective parameter optimization analysis, unstructured data analysis, and forecast analysis based on material properties. Good practices in CCR units have also been extended to other oil refining and chemical units, such as Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) and ethylene cracking. In terms of equipment preventive maintenance, it introduced how to integrated application of Internet of things, deep machine learning, knowledge map and other technology to build real-time and on-line distributed equipment health monitoring and early warning system, for early detection of equipment hidden danger, early warning, early treatment of providing effective means, guarantee equipment run healthy and stable for a long period of time, to reduce unplanned downtime losses. In particular, the establishment of equipment prediction model based on time series and AI can realize effective monitoring and early warning of equipment faults such as shaft displacement, shaft fracture, shell cracking, power overload, and prediction of equipment remaining life. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The developed FD routine is based on the application of the mathematical morphological gradient (MMG) technique on the stator currents. Being a time-domain technique, it is less computational burdensome than the frequency-domain-based FD. To detect the faulty phase, we introduced and implemented the differential MMG (ΔMMG) algorithm concept. A comprehensive electromagnetic investigation of harmonics and interharmonics contents due to the ITF, the DTC controller's reaction, the inverter's switching activity is presented. A design guideline of selecting the structuring element length in the FD routine was introduced. A physics-based cosimulation platform was built to investigate the feasibility of the proposed FD algorithm. The simulation reinforced by the experimental results depicted the robustness of the FD method. The comparative analysis is presented between the developed ΔMMG and the conventional motor current signature analysis (MCSA).

Physics-based models are particularly suited to such problems, due to their ability to predict a system's behaviour for cases which have not been observed or measured. In this work, we focus on a class of faults that introduce “new dynamics” into a system. These behaviours are not present in the healthy system, and may occur at locations which are initially represented by ideal boundary conditions. Examples include joints and connections, which may develop additional dynamics between components when they wear or become loose. While there are many widely used approaches to update the system parameters as they change over time due to wear, damage, and other faults, there are few works that deal with identifying and characterizing faults which introduce new dynamic behaviours into the system. The Bayesian inference framework in the field of uncertainty quantification allows for the simultaneous consideration of parameter uncertainty and model structure uncertainty. However, distinguishing between the effects of parameter uncertainty, and model structure uncertainty caused by new dynamics, is not generally possible without additional information about the expected nature of the uncertainties. We propose a Bayesian inference-based approach in which we use physics-based models of the healthy system and the anticipated new dynamics faults to identify the most likely cause of an observed unknown fault condition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology through numerical simulations of a rotating machinery system. © International Institute of Acoustics and Vibration (IIAV), 2022.","identifiability; new dynamics; physics-based modelling","Bayesian networks; Condition monitoring; Fault detection; Inference engines; Uncertainty analysis; Wear of materials; Bayesian inference; Fault conditions; Faults diagnosis; Identifiability; Model structure uncertainties; New dynamic; Parameter model; Parameter uncertainty; Physics-based; Physics-based models; Dynamics","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149809486"

Although most vision-based control algorithms rely on the detection of neighbors, they usually neglect critical perceptual factors such as visual occlusions and their effect on the scalability of the swarm. To estimate the impact of occlusions on the detection of neighbors, we propose a simple but perceptually realistic visual neighbor selection model that discards obstructed agents. We evaluate the visibility model using a potential-field-based flocking algorithm with up to one thousand agents, showing that occlusions have adverse effects on the inter-agent distances and velocity alignment as the swarm scales up, both in terms of group size and density. In particular, we find that small agent displacements have considerable effects on neighbor visibility and lead to control discontinuities. We show that the destabilizing effects of visibility switches, i.e., agents continuously becoming visible or invisible, can be mitigated if agents select their neighbors from adjacent Voronoi regions. We validate the resulting flocking algorithm using up to one hundred agents with quadcopter dynamics and subject to sensor noise in a high-fidelity physics simulator. The results show that Voronoi-based interactions enable vision-based swarms to remain collision-free, ordered, and cohesive in the presence of occlusions. These results are consistent across group sizes, agent number densities, and relative localization noise. © 2022 IEEE.","agent-based modeling; multi-robot systems; scalability; Unmanned aerial vehicles; vision","Air navigation; Antennas; Computational methods; Drones; Fault tolerance; Multi agent systems; Multipurpose robots; Scalability; Visibility; Agent-based model; Centralised; Collective systems; Collisions avoidance; Flocking algorithms; Group size; Location awareness; Perceptual factors; Vision based; Vision based control; Autonomous agents","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126309294"

However, sensors are often not properly designed, installed, calibrated, located, and maintained, which negatively impacts FDD performance. Several sensor-related FDD topics have been widely studied, covering a wide range of fault types and applications. However, it is difficult to get a clear picture of the technical development of sensor-related topics in FDD. A systematic review of sensor topics is needed to summarize the existing research in a logical way, draw conclusions on the current development, and predict the future development of sensors in building FDD. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive literature review of more than 100 FDD-sensor-related papers. In this article, we subdivide the FDD tasks into building-level, system-level, and component-level FDD, and review sensor-related topics in each category. Our major conclusions are: (a) current data-driven FDD research focuses more on FDD algorithms than sensors, (b) sensor “hardware” research topics are less studied than sensor “software” topics, (c) very few papers focus on sensor engineering as an integral aspect of FDD development, and (d) some important sensor topics, such as sensor cost-effectiveness and sensor schema/layout/location, are not well studied. Finally, we discuss the need for a systematic framework of FDD sensors and models to integrate sensor design/selection, sensor data analysis/mining, feature selection, physics-based or data-driven algorithm development, sensor fault detection, sensor calibration, and sensor maintenance. Finally, expert interviews are conducted to validate the above findings and conclusions. © 2021 The Author(s)","Fault detection and diagnostics; Sensor analysis; Sensor calibration; Sensor fault; Sensor selection","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123624242"

Most prognostics and health management (PHM) models are generally based on obtaining the remaining useful life (RUL) of concerned bearings. Since it is difficult to quantify and to monitor bearing status from vibration signal and there is no clear definition what is the end of bearing service life, determine RUL is not realistic in industrial practice. In order to achieve reliable fault diagnosis and prognosis for HSTWSB, it is of great importance and necessity to conduct a thorough research under realistic or close to reality operation conditions. Therefore, in this paper two types of techniques, i.e. vibration and acoustic emission, have been particularly studied. Different from many previous PHM studies which seek seeking bearing's RUL by establishing physics model or artificial neural network model, a new hybrid model based on extendable useful life (EUL) under continuous monitoring and bearing status classification is proposed. Statistical properties of typical time domain features extracted from vibration and acoustic emission are studied. Correlations of these parameters with bearing status are reviewed and feasible parameters are evaluated for bearing status quantification. By driving an electric multiple unit (EMU) speed up to 350 km/h, a test device close to real running environment was introduced. A batch of bearings with different level of nature defects instead of artifacts were particularly selected as database samples of this paper. Test procedure was designed to allow fault diagnosis to be verified under low, medium and high speeds and the corresponding database and knowledgebase of bearing status assessment are established. Defect geometries were quantified with 3D laser scanning technology so that it provides intuitive references for evaluating effectiveness of signal processing approaches with respective to bearing damage status. Instead of calculating how much RUL left by physics model or neural network model, the proposed approach determines if the useful life can be extended from one grade level to another or to next overhaul under continuous monitoring. The proposed model establishes an initial database and knowledgebase for HSTWSB monitoring.

A model-based approach, taking partially into account degradation phenomena, is proposed in order to increase the robustness of the tool regarding transient operations and stack ageing. The considered faults are the abnormal operating conditions that can decrease the fuel cell lifetime. The fault detection approach is based on residual generation using both voltage and high frequency resistance measurements and thus combining the advantages of knowledge-based model and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) diagnosis approaches. To that end, a multi-physics fuel cell model has been used. This model computes not only the stack voltage but also the high frequency resistance in dynamic conditions. Additionally, the model is modified to take into account the ageing of the fuel cell. Validation is carried out on experimental characterizations during 1,000 h ageing. The results on a new fuel cell stack show a score of 91% for fault isolation. However, without any adaptation, this score drops dramatically as the stack ages. Finally, thanks to ageing modeling and to the proposed adaptation of the detection/isolation procedure, the diagnosis performance remains reliable during fuel cell stack ageing. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH","Ageing; Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy; Fault Diagnosis; PEM Fuel Cell; Physical Model; Residual Generation","Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Fault detection; Knowledge based systems; Abnormal operating conditions; Diagnosis performance; Experimental characterization; Fault detection and isolation; High frequency resistance; Impedance measurement; Knowledge-based model; Multi-physics modeling; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091680137"

Nevertheless, transforming large volumes of high-resolution PMU measurements into actionable insights remains challenging. A central challenge is creating flexible and scalable online anomaly detection in PMU data streams. PMU data can hold multiple types of anomalies arising in the physical system or the cyber system (measurements and communication networks). Increasing the grid situational awareness for noisy measurement data and Bad Data (BD) anomalies has become more and more significant. Number of machine learning, data analytics and physics based algorithms have been developed for anomaly detection, but need to be validated with realistic synchophasor data. Access to field data is very challenging due to confidentiality and security reasons. This paper presents a method for generating realistic synchrophasor data for the given synthetic network as well as event and bad data detection and classification algorithms. The developed algorithms include Bayesian and change-point techniques to identify anomalies, a statistical approach for event localization and multi-step clustering approach for event classification.

In this paper, a novel physics-constrained dictionary learning approach is proposed to simultaneously improve the efficiency of data collection with compressed sensing (CS) and perform diagnosis with the classification of sensor data. Two-stage optimization is performed. At the first stage, measurement matrix is optimized to determine the time stamps of collected data points with a fixed basis matrix. This is solved based on a constrained FrameSense algorithm. At the second stage, the basis and classification matrices are optimized with the fixed measurement matrix based on the K-SVD algorithm. The above two optimization steps are repeated until the optimal measurement, classification, and basis matrices converge without further improvement. The recovered signals can be classified more accurately based on the learned classification matrix for specific data.

Unlike the existing simulation method, it is possible to understand the power and performance of the device at each time by predicting the parameters based on the physics equation with the machine learning model and substituting the values back into the physics equation. We developed a flow model that predicts the load to be handled by each device and equipment models that calculate the device's performance. The model's performance was excellent, and the highest accuracy was obtained by sequentially inputting the input variables ranked using the Spearman correlation coefficient for both the flow rate and each equipment model. In the case of pumps, all five pumps satisfied CV(RMSE) of 30% in Cases 07 to 09, to which the Spearman correlation coefficient was applied. The CV(RMSE), due to the outlet temperature of the turbo chiller, heat exchanger, and heat storage tank, satisfies ±30%. This method overcomes the limitation of not reflecting the physical characteristics of devices in data-based modeling (black-box) of HVAC&R systems. Also, this reflects the current system status from data, and it could solve the limitations of the existing simulation method (white-box) that relied on design documents. As a result, it is possible to obtain reliable calculation results by reducing the modeler's subjective intervention. Because it is modeled on device units, it can also be used for fault detection and optimal operation control calculations inside the system. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Automation simulation model; Data-driven method; Equipment performance model; Gray-box method; HVAC&R system simulation","Digital storage; Heat storage; HVAC; Office buildings; Air refrigeration; Automation simulation; Automation simulation model; Data-driven methods; Equipment performance; Equipment performance model; Gray-box method; Heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration system simulation; Heating-ventilation-air-conditioning systems; Performance Modeling; Refrigeration system; Simulation model; System simulations; Fault detection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122680639"

Therefore, operation at maximum performance is the key for long-term profitability. This can be achieved by advanced performance monitoring and instant or gradual failure detection methodologies. We present in this paper a combined approach on model-based fault detection by means of physical and statistical models and failure diagnosis based on physics of failure. Both approaches contribute to optimized PV plant operation and maintenance based on typically available supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data.

In this case study, underperforming values of the inverters of the PV plant were reliably detected and possible root causes were identified.

To enable AFDD, a baseline depicting the normal operation mode is needed to detect whether the building operation deviates from normality. Existing research using physics-based knowledge and models for AFDD has mainly taken a trial-and-error approach to determine if a given baseline is sufficient via empirical experiments. A mechanism to support decisions such as how many samples and what samples should be included in the baseline is currently lacking. In this study, a data-driven method for AFDD baseline construction based on information entropy is developed. The entropy is derived based on cosine similarity among typical building automation system measurements in conjunction with outdoor weather information. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using real building data. Evaluation results indicate that the fault detection strategy adopting the proposed method has similar or better accuracy in detecting faults compared to the same fault detection strategy using the baseline construction method from the literature.

Increasing the reading frequency and the use of measurement data to control the heating system expands the requirements for the reliability of heat meters. The aim of the research is to analyze a large set of meters in the real network and predict their faults to avoid inaccurate readings, incorrect billing, heating system disruption, and unnecessary maintenance. The reliability analysis of heat meters, based on historical data collected over several years, shows some regularities, which cannot be easily described by physics-based models. The failure rate is almost constant and does depend on the past, but is a non-linear combination of state variables. To predict meters' failures in the next billing period, three independent machine learning models are implemented and compared with selected metrics, because even the high performance of a single model (87% true positive for neural network) may be insufficient to make a maintenance decision. Additionally, performing hyperparameter optimization boosts the models' performance by a few percent. Finally, three improved models are used to build an ensemble classifier, which outperforms the individual models. The proposed procedure ensures the high efficiency of fault detection ( > 95%), while maintaining overfitting at the minimum level. The methodology is universal and can be utilized to study the reliability and predict faults of other types of meters and different objects with the constant failure rate. © 2019 by the authors.","Artificial Neural Network (ANN); Bagging Decision Tree (BDT); District heating;fault detection; Ensemble model; Heat meter; Hyperparameter optimization; Machine Learning (ML); Predictive maintenance; Support Vector Machines (SVM)","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072379967"

The comparison takes into consideration two differences between the approaches, the type of diagnostic space and diagnostic decision rule. To that end, two stages are proposed. In the first one, a data-driven approach with an artificial neural network (ANN) that recognizes faults in the space of measurement deviations is compared with a hybrid GPA approach that employs the same type of ANN to recognize faults in the space of estimated fault parameter. Different case studies for both anomaly detection and fault identification are proposed to evaluate the diagnostic spaces. They are formed by varying the classification, type of diagnostic analysis, and deviation noise scheme. In the second stage, the original GPA is reconstructed replacing the ANN with a tolerance-based rule to make diagnostic decisions. Here, two aspects are under analysis: the comparison of GPA classification rules and whole approaches. The results reveal that for simple classifications both spaces are equally accurate for anomaly detection and fault identification. However, for complex scenarios, the data-driven approach provides on average slightly better results for fault identification. The use of a hybrid GPA with ANN for a full classification instead of an original GPA with tolerance-based rule causes an increase of 12.49% in recognition accuracy for fault identification and up to 54.39% for anomaly detection. As for the whole approach comparison, the application of a data-driven approach instead of the original GPA can lead to an improvement of 12.14% and 53.26% in recognition accuracy for fault identification and anomaly detection, respectively. © IMechE 2021.","data-driven approach; fault parameter estimation; fault recognition; gas path analysis; Gas turbine diagnostics; physics-based approach","Anomaly detection; Chemical detection; Gas turbines; Neural networks; Regression analysis; Classification rules; Comparative studies; Data-driven approach; Diagnostic decisions; Fault identifications; Gas turbine diagnostics; Measurement deviations; Recognition accuracy; Fault detection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100481958"

The article consists of two parts: Part one analyzes the differences between using sensor values and using residual values for fault diagnosis. Residual values denote the health of a component by comparing sensor values to a predefined model of normal behaviour. We further analyse how faults propagate through components of a physical system and argue for the use of residual values for diagnosing physical systems. In part two we extend the theory of established consistency-based diagnosis algorithms to use residual values. We also illustrate how users of the presented diagnosis methodology are free to substitute the residual generating equations and the diagnosis algorithm to suit their specific needs. For diagnosis, we present the algorithm HySD, based on Satisfiability Modulo Linear Arithmetic. We present an implementation of HySD using threshold values and a symbolic diagnosis approach. However, the approach is also suitable to integrate modern machine learning methods for anomaly detection and combine them with a multitude of diagnosis approaches. Through experiments on the process-industry benchmark Tennessee Eastman Process and another benchmark consisting of multiple tank systems we show the feasibility of our approach. Overall we show how our novel diagnosis approach offers a practical methodology that allows industry to advance from current state of the art anomaly detection to automated fault diagnosis. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Diagnosis; Fault detection and isolation; Qualitative physics; Satisfiability","Anomaly detection; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Anomaly detection; Diagnosis algorithms; Fault detection and isolation; Faults diagnosis; Industrial production; Physical systems; Qualitative physics; Residual value; Satisfiability; Sensor values; Formal logic","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122278707"

European Directive 2013/59/EURATOM has been transposed into the legislation of several countries and provides for the need for long‐term monitoring of radon in homes and workplaces by setting the average annual reference level at 300 Bq/m3. At the same time, radon is a precursor factor, its emission being correlated with seismic and volcanic activity. In this case, the protection of the population is ensured by a forecast similar to a meteorological one. The NIEP (Na-tional Institute for Earth Physics) is developing a multidisciplinary real‐time monitoring network in the most dangerous seismic area in Romania, Vrancea. This is located at the bend of the Carpathian Mountains and is characterized by deep earthquakes (over 80 km), with destructive effects over large distances. Implementing a multidisciplinary monitoring network that includes radon, in-volves finding the locations and equipment that will give the best results. There is no generic solution for achieving this, because the geological structure depends on the monitoring area, and in most cases the equipment does not offer the ability to transmit data in real time. The positioning of the monitoring stations was based on fault maps of the Vrancea area. Depending on the results, some of the locations were changed in pursuit of a correlation with zonal seismicity. Through re-peated tests, we established the optimal sampling rate for minimizing errors, maintaining measurement accuracy, and ensuring the detection of anomalies in real time. The radon222 Rn was determined by the number of counts and ROI1 (region of interest) values, depending on the particulari-ties of the equipment. Finally, we managed to establish a real‐time radon monitoring network which transmits data to geophysical platforms and makes correlations with the seismicity in the Vrancea area. The equipment, designed to store data for long periods of time then manually download it with manufacturers’ applications, now works in real time, after we implemented software designed specifically for this purpose. © 2021 by the authors.

Automatic and rapid detection of coarse-scale compartments with distinct static and dynamic properties is an integral part of such high-level reservoir analysis. In this work, we present a hybrid framework specific to reservoir analysis for an automatic detection of clusters in space using spatial and temporal field data, coupled with a physics-based multiscale modeling approach. A novel and rigorous non-local formulation for flow in porous media is presented, in which the reservoir is represented by an adjacency matrix describing the connectivities of comprising compartments. We automatically divide the reservoir into a number of distinct compartments, in which the direction-dependent multiphase flow communication is a function of non-local phase potential differences. Our proposed clustering framework begins with a mixed-type raw dataset which can be categorical/numerical, spatial/temporal, and discrete/continuous. The dataset can contain noisy/missing values of different data types including but not limited to well production/injection history, well location, well type, geological features, PVT measurements, perforation data, etc. Unsupervised clustering techniques suited to the input data types (e.g. k-prototypes, spectral, Gaussian Mixtures, and hierarchical clustering), and appropriate distance measures (such as Euclidean distance, soft dynamic time warping, and mode) are used. The input data is standardized, and upon convergence check, the best clustering representation is obtained. Finally, Support-Vector-Machine technique is utilized in the kernel space to trace a demarcating hyperplane for the clusters. In a specific case study reported here, the proposed workflow is applied to a major field with a couple of hundreds of wells with more than 40 years of production history. Leveraging the fast forward model, an efficient ensemble-based history matching framework is applied to reduce the uncertainty of the global reservoir parameters such as inter-blocks and aquifer-reservoir communications, fault transmissibilities, and block-based oil-in-place. The ensemble of history matched models are then used to provide a probabilistic forecast for different field development scenarios. In addition, the clustering framework enables us to treat missing data and use the augmented dataset for improving the clustering accuracy. In summary, in this work a novel hybrid approach is presented in which we couple a physics-based non-local modeling framework with data-driven clustering techniques to provide a fast and accurate multiscale modeling of compartmentalized reservoirs. This research also adds to the literature by presenting a comprehensive work on spatio-temporal clustering for reservoir studies applications that well considers the clustering complexities, the intrinsic sparse and noisy nature of the data, and the interpretability of the outcome. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","artificial intelligence; machine learning; non-local multi-scale flow formulation; reservoir modeling; spatio-temporal clustering","Aquifers; Artificial intelligence; Cluster analysis; Dynamics; Input output programs; Learning systems; Petroleum reservoirs; Porous materials; Support vector machines; Vector spaces; Appropriate distances; Hier-archical clustering; Multi-scale flow; Probabilistic forecasts; Reservoir modeling; Spatio-temporal clustering; Support vector machine techniques; Unsupervised clustering technique; artificial intelligence; cluster analysis; hydrocarbon reservoir; machine learning; numerical model; porous medium; spatiotemporal analysis; Petroleum reservoir engineering","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073071478"

Two fatal crashes of the Airbus Super Puma helicopter were caused by faults in a planetary gear-bearing component. The accident investigations showed that the fault (i.e. the bore crack) initiated from fatigue spalls on the planet bearing outer raceway, which is integral with the bore of the planet gear. A recent study proposed a method based on planet-gear synchronous signal averaging to detect a planet gear bore crack. Applying deep-learning networks to gear fault diagnosis has becomes a popular topic in machine health monitoring, with the majority of studies focused on fault classification problems. In this paper, we propose a method that relies mostly on the data without detailed knowledge of the system physics. We employ a deep machine learning method, i.e. the Long Short-Term Memory based Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN), as a signal processing tool to analyse vibration data generated in a gear rig test with faulty gears. We focus on detecting anomalies or changes induced by the gear faults in the LSTM prediction error signal, or LSTM-Residual. We compare the fault detectability of LSTM-Residual with that of some of the commonly used residual signals in gear fault diagnostics. We also provide a detailed study on how to apply the LSTM to monitoring gear tooth crack growth at various stages of the fault development, and what the potential pitfalls are in applying the LSTM network—especially the problem of false detection. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Fault diagnosis; Gear tooth crack; Long Short-Term Memory","Bearings (machine parts); Computer aided diagnosis; Condition monitoring; Cracks; Deep learning; Epicyclic gears; Gear teeth; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Signal processing; Vibration analysis; Accident investigation; Gear fault diagnosis; Gear fault diagnostics; Health monitoring system; Machine health monitoring; Machine learning methods; Mechanical components; Prediction error signals; Fault detection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091319042"

They operate over key process parameters on the basis of the metrological measurements acquired from the process and their deviations from the target setpoints. Conventionally, R2R controllers have been implemented independently of the actual equipment condition, which is obviously affecting the process stability and performance. Therefore, both equipment signals and process states shall be considered to make the R2R controllers more robust to the equipment condition drifts. In this paper, we propose a novel physics-informed framework to integrate the real-time equipment condition, based on the Fault Detection and Classification (FDC) data, into the R2R controllers. By utilizing Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN), the implicit relationship structure between metrology measurements, FDC indicators, and R2R regulators can be learned and reviewed explicitly. The structure shall be further reviewed to valid with the existing relationships and expert knowledge. Infeasible causalities on the structure will be constrained via setting up the blacklist at the structure learning stage. The proposed framework consists of the offline modeling stage, which incorporates the process, equipment variables, and the expert knowledge in the structure learning, and the online control stage, which constructs the Structured R2R controller (SRC) based on the relationship structure.

The proposed SRC not only optimizes the operation with respect to the target control values but also considers the equipment and process states simultaneously.

In this work, we present a hybrid model of CPMS combining sensor data, context information, and expert knowledge. We used the identification of global operational states and a multimodel framework to improve anomaly detection and diagnosis. The anomaly detection is based on context-sensitive adaptive threshold limits. Root cause diagnosis is based on classification models and expert knowledge. The proposed approach was implemented using the Internet of Things (IoT) to extract data from a computer numerical control machine. Results showed that using a context-sensitive modeling strategy allowed to combine physics-based and data-driven models for residual analysis to detect an anomaly in the part, machine, or process. The identification of root cause was improved by adding context information in classification models to identify worn or broken tools and wrong material. Note to Practitioners - Anomaly detection and diagnosis of manufacturing equipment is a complex problem. Some of the challenges are complex machine dynamics and nonstationary operating conditions. This paper describes a framework for modeling manufacturing equipment using a combination of sensor data, context information, and system knowledge. The proposed modeling framework is used to improve anomaly detection for diagnostics using a context-sensitive strategy. This work aims to support more effective maintenance actions by identifying problems in the machine, part, or process. The modeling and anomaly detection strategy was used to identify anomalies in computer numerical control machines and can be extended to other equipment on the plant floor. © 2020 IEEE.","Cyber-physical systems (CPSs); fault detection; manufacturing systems","Classification (of information); Computer aided diagnosis; Computer control systems; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Fault detection; Internet of things; Manufacture; Adaptive thresholds; Classification models; Computer numerical control machines; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Detection and diagnosis; Internet of thing (IOT); Manufacturing process; Network communications; Anomaly detection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074852388"

The system incorporated renewable sources and process used to produce the green hydrogen is the hybrid multi-source system (HMS). The production of hydrogen needs a reliable HMS, which always requires online monitoring for real-time Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) because the risk of accidents in HMS and safety issues increases due to the possibility of faults. However, online monitoring of FDI is challenging due to the multi-physics dynamics of HMS and the inclusion of uncertain parameters and several disturbances. This paper proposes an online robust fault detection algorithm to detect system faults based on the properties of the graphical linear fractional transformation bond graph (LFT-BG) modeling approach. Here, the analytical redundancy relations (ARRs) and their uncertain parts extracted from the LFT-BG model are used to develop an online robust FDI algorithm for HMS. Numerical evaluations of ARRs and their uncertain parts, respectively, generate the residual signals known as ""faults indicators"" and their uncertain bounds known as ""adaptive thresholds."" These thresholds evolve with system variables in the presence of parameter uncertainties for ensuring robust FDI for HMS to minimize false alarms. The validation of this approach is carried out using 20sim software that is familiar with BG modeling. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

This, together with restrictive regulations, results in the replacement of critical components in initial stages of degradation, as well as a lack of data on advanced stages of degradation. This paper proposes a hybrid model-based approach (HyMA) to overcome the lack of failure data on a HVAC system installed in a passenger train carriage. The proposed HyMA combines physics-based models with data-driven models to deploy diagnostic and prognostic processes for a complex and critical system. The physics-based model generates data on healthy and faulty working conditions; the faults are generated in different levels of degradation and can appear individually or together. A fusion of synthetic data and measured data is used to train, validate, and test the proposed hybrid model (HyM) for fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) of the HVAC system. The model obtains an accuracy of 92.60%. In addition, the physics-based model generates run-to-failure data for the HVAC air filter to develop a remaining useful life (RUL) prediction model, the RUL estimations performed obtained an accuracy in the range of 95.21–97.80% Both models obtain a remarkable accuracy. The development presented will result in a tool which provides relevant information on the health state of the HVAC system, extends its useful life, reduces its life cycle cost, and improves its reliability and availability; thus enhancing the sustainability of the system. © 2021 by the authors.

The detection and isolation scheme is composed of an extended observer, a cumulative sum algorithm and an exponentially weighted moving average chart. In the case of interdependent parts, a dynamic parity space approach is proposed to isolate one or two simultaneous faults with constraints based on the mass flow rate continuity and the energy conservation for the overall system. The method allows settling adaptive thresholds that avoid pessimistic decision about the continuation of tests while detecting and isolating faults in the system. Then a fault-tolerant system reconfiguration mechanism is provided with a control law which compensates for an estimated actuator additive fault to maintain the overall system stability or allows converging to a reference state in order to overcome instabilities and take into account actuator saturations. For that purpose, the fault-tolerant control algorithm comprises a linear quadratic regulator, an unknown input observer to estimate the fault and an anti-windup scheme.

Internal short circuit is a very critical issue that is often ascribed to be a cause of many accidents involving Li-ion batteries. A novel method that can detect the Internal short circuit in real time based on an advanced machine leaning approach, is proposed. Based on an equivalent electric circuit model, a set of features encompassing the physics of Li-ion cell with short circuit fault are identified and extracted from each charge-discharge cycle. The training feature set is generated with and without an external short-circuit resistance across the battery terminals. To emulate a real user scenario, internal short is induced by mechanical abuse. The testing feature set is generated from the battery charge-discharge data before and after the abuse. A random forest classifier is trained with the training feature set. The fault detection accuracy for the testing dataset is found to be more than 97%.

While detection accuracy of such approaches is generally very good, their performance on fault isolation often suffers from the fact that fault conditions affect a large portion of the measured signals thereby masking the fault source. To overcome this limitation, we propose a hybrid approach combining physical performance models with deep learning algorithms. Unobserved process variables are inferred with a physics-based performance model to enhance the input space of a data-driven diagnostics model. The re-sulting increased input space gains representation power enabling more accurate fault detection and isolation. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we generate a condition monitoring dataset of an advanced gas turbine during flight conditions under healthy and four faulty operative conditions based on the Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (C-MAPSS) dynamical model. We evaluate the performance of the proposed hybrid methodology in combi-nation with two different deep learning algorithms: deep feed forward neural networks and Variational Autoencoders, both of which demonstrate a significant improvement when applied within the hybrid fault detection and diagnostics frame-work. The proposed method is able to outperform pure data-driven solutions, particularly for systems with a high variability of operating conditions. It provides superior results both for fault detection as well as for fault isolation. For the fault isolation task, it overcomes the smearing effect that is com-monly observed in pure data-driven approaches and enables a precise isolation of the affected signal. We also demonstrate that deep learning algorithms provide a better performance on the fault detection task compared to the traditional machine learning algorithms. © 2019, Prognostics and Health Management Society.

The aim is to improve the reliability of a cryogenic bench operation in the transients and to allow to converge to a wider range of operating points. The fault detection is performed with residual-based methods. The residual is generated by an unknown input observer with an unscented transformed which also allows to reconstruct the unknown input. Then the goal is to provide a fault-tolerant system reconfiguration mechanism with a control law which compensates for the estimated actuator additive faults to maintain the overall system stability. For that purpose we use a model predictive control method on an equivalent system with the reconstructed unknown input. An error feedback and a fault compensation control law is designed in order to minimize an infinite horizon cost function within the framework of linear matrix inequalities. The model and the estimation part were validated on real data from Mascotte test bench (ONERA/CNES), and the reconfiguration control law was validated in realistic simulations. Copyright © 2019.

Moreover, these HIs have some unknown burrs and fluctuations. To overcome these limitations, an architecturally explainable network for machine degradation modeling is proposed in this article. The first three hidden layers are reformulated from three advanced signal processing technologies, including Hilbert transform, squared envelope, and Fourier transform, to map temporal signals in the time domain into demodulated signals in the squared envelope spectrum domain so as to directly link the proposed network with fault frequencies and their harmonics in the frequency domain. The fourth hidden layer consists of a full connection layer with one hidden node and a novel knowledge-guided loss function specifically designed for exploring and extracting informative degradation features. Case studies are implemented to verify the proposed methodology and show that the proposed HIs have more stable and robust performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Another superiority of the proposed network lies in its full transparency and interpretability by effectively integrating physics-based signal processing technologies with an interpretable artificial network structure for machine degradation modeling.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Architecturally explainable network; health index (HI) construction; machine degradation modeling; novel knowledge-guided loss function","Frequency domain analysis; Life cycle; Mathematical transformations; Time domain analysis; Transparency; Architecturally explainable network; Degradation model; Features extraction; Health index  construction; Health indices; Index; Index construction; Loss functions; Machine degradation modeling; Novel knowledge-guided loss function; Predictive models; Signal-processing; Vibration; Signal processing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135207604"

However, a sufficient amount of fault data is harder to collect practically than the normal data, as a result, the imbalanced training data set can significantly affect the accuracy of the trained classifier. In this paper, we proposed a data augmentation approach that uses physics-based high-fidelity dynamics simulation as an alternative to acquiring practical fault data. The overall procedure includes: (1) The high-fidelity numerical simulation model reflecting the behavior of rotor to obtain the vibration signature of fault data; and, (2) data augmentation with the simulation fault data in conjunction with experimental normal and fault datasets. A fully connected Neural Network (FCNN) is applied to build the classification model that identifies rotor faults focusing on mass unbalance. The rotor system considered in this study consists of rigid discs, shaft, eccentric mass, and bearing housings. The numerical simulation model in this work considers high-fidelity physical behaviors such flexible multibody dynamics having centrifugal force and gyroscopic effects. Time domain data of the vertical and horizontal vibration responses of bearing housings are obtained from simulation and then FFT is applied to extract the main feature in frequency domain, which is the amplitude of the 1X harmonics of the vibration responses. The data augmentation is accomplished with frequency domain data both from simulation results and experimental acquisition. This approach can tackle data imbalance problem which is one of the most critical hurdles in neural net-based. fault diagnosis. From experimental verification, high accuracies more than 90 % of rotor fault diagnosis, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework compared to the model with insufficient fault data. © 2022 SPIE.","Artificial neural network; Data augmentation; Diagnosis; High-fidelity simulation; Rotor faults","Bearings (machine parts); Classification (of information); Failure analysis; Fault detection; Frequency domain analysis; Housing; Neural networks; Bearing housing; Data augmentation; Fault data; High-fidelity; High-fidelity simulations; Numerical simulation models; Rotor fault; Rotor fault diagnosis; Simulation data; Vibration response; Numerical models","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132046227"

Despite performance and reliability improvements of utility-scale wind turbines over the years, the industry still experiences premature component failures, leading to increased operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. Among various turbine components, gearboxes—and, more broadly, drivetrains—have shown to be costly to maintain throughout the design life of a wind turbine. The problem of premature component failure is industry wide. As early as 2007, the US Department of Energy (DOE) started to address this challenge through the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (NREL’s) reliability initiative that first focused on gearboxes and more recently expanded to entire drivetrains. The wind turbine drivetrain condition monitoring and wind plant O&M research that is the subject of this paper is part of the NREL initiative and includes a few research and development (R&D) activities conducted during the 2010s. These activities included technology evaluation during the first few years; novel monitoring technique investigation (specifically, compact filter analysis) during the middle years; and data and physics domain modeling for fault detection and prediction in recent years. A high-level summary of these activities is provided in this paper along with some key observations from each activity. Most of the work discussed has been published and can be referred to for more information. They reflect the expected evolution of wind turbine condition monitoring and O&M in the US market—primarily, a land-based perspective. In addition, we have identified several R&D opportunities that can be picked up by the research community to help industry advance in related areas, making wind power more cost competitive in the future. © 2021, Australian Acoustical Society.","Compact filter analysis; Condition monitoring; Data analytics; Drivetrain; Operation and maintenance; Wind turbine","Costs; Fault detection; Patient monitoring; Wind power; Wind turbines; Installation capacities; Monitoring techniques; National Renewable Energy Laboratory; Operation and maintenance; Performance and reliabilities; Research and development; Technology evaluation; US Department of Energy; Condition monitoring","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102595762"

The purpose of presenting this approach is to have the lowest computational load and the highest accuracy and speed and to be suitable for real-time applications. The main idea is TID without directly calculating the unstable equilibrium point (UEP). In fact, transient instability is detected only by identifying the characteristics of the UEP and the kinetic energy function along with the potential energy boundary surface (PEBS) function. A new and standard single machine infinite bus system with high penetration of wind farms is used for simulation. First, dynamic modeling of various components of doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) and synchronous generator are described. Then, a model for the grid-connected DFIG is developed and a new PEBS-based index (NPI) for TID is presented. The NPI requires only post-fault data and can be applied as a general tool to any power system with any change in topology and operating conditions. Also, the impact of increasing the penetration of wind power, changing the operating conditions of the power system, different fault locations, and the power system strength on the transient stability is investigated. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach for TID in a shorter time. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Doubly fed induction generator; Kinetic energy; Potential energy boundary surface; Transient energy function; Transient instability detection","Asynchronous generators; Electric fault currents; Electric machine theory; Electric power system interconnection; Electric utilities; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Molecular physics; Stability; Transients; Wind power; Doubly fed induction generators; Energy; Instability detections; Potential energy boundary surfaces; Power; Real- time; Time transient; Transient energy functions; Transient instability; Transient instability detection; Potential energy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108873088"

In addition to efficiency, a successful methodology for industrial applications should be also characterized by ease of implementation and operation. To this purpose, a comprehensive and straightforward approach for detection, classification, and integrated diagnostics of gas turbine sensors (named DCIDS) is proposed in this paper. The tool consists of two main algorithms, i.e., the anomaly detection algorithm (ADA) and the anomaly classification algorithm (ACA). The ADA identifies anomalies according to three different levels of filtering based on gross physics threshold application, intersensor statistical analysis (sensor voting), and single-sensor statistical analysis. Anomalies in the time series are identified by the ADA, together with their characteristics, which are analyzed by the ACA to perform their classification. Fault classes discriminate among anomalies according to their time correlation, magnitude, and number of sensors in which an anomaly is contemporarily identified. Results of anomaly identification and classification can subsequently be used for sensor diagnostic purposes. The performance of the tool is assessed in this paper by analyzing two temperature time series with redundant sensors taken on a Siemens GT in operation. The results show that the DCIDS is able to identify and classify different types of anomalies. In particular, in the first dataset, two severely incoherent sensors are identified and their anomalies are correctly classified. In the second dataset, the DCIDS tool proves to be capable of identifying and classifying clustered spikes of different magnitudes. © 2018 by ASME.","","Classification (of information); Fault tolerant computer systems; Statistical methods; Time series; Anomaly detection; Anomaly identification; Anomaly-detection algorithms; Classification algorithm; Data cleaning; Integrated diagnostics; Redundant sensors; Time correlations; Gas turbines","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032633681"

To address this challenge, this study proposes a novel approach, namely physics-based convolutional neural network (PCNN), for fault diagnosis of rotating machinery and targets fault detection of rolling-element bearings as a special application of PCNN. In the proposed approach, an exclusively data-driven deep learning approach, called convolutional neural network, is carefully modified to incorporate useful information from physical knowledge about bearings and their fault characteristics.

But the problem of detecting faults and predicting failure in the components of reusable rocket engine systems is difficult and complex to solve. Since the number of data samples on the fault or failure status during the actual operation of the rocket engine is very small, it is difficult to adapt a data-drive approach of health management. Furthermore, the failure modes for these systems might transcend electrical, mechanical, and fluid systems. Therefore, one of the key concepts of the approach proposed in this study for fault detection and diagnosis is model-based quantitative assessment that considers system-level interactions in the target system. In this approach, multi-physics system-level modeling and simulation for a target system are conducted by using Modelica, an equation-based, object-oriented modeling language that allows acausal modeling for complex cyber-physical systems. Modelica has an important modeling capability for system-level interactions that involve multi-physics phenomena. One advantage of the model-based health-monitoring approach is that faults and failure modes are traced back to physically meaningful information, which is invaluable for the maintainer. Thus, this model-based approach for condition-based maintenance has the potential to provide reliable early fault detection and diagnosis during post-flight investigation for maintenance decision-making. In this study, multi-physics system-level modeling and simulation for a target system under both normal and abnormal conditions have been conducted based on an understanding of the failure mechanism to obtain prior data sets for fault detection and diagnosis. In this proposed approach, the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)algorithm was utilized to evaluate dissimilarity between the prior data sets and sensor measurement data obtained during the flight, and hierarchical clustering technique was applied for categorization in failure mode based on dissimilarity of these data. In addition, a trial case study has been conducted on electromechanical actuators (EMAs), an important component of a rocket engine, towards the construction of model-based prognostics and health management (PHM)technologies for reusable liquid rocket engines. Based on the trial results of the model-based approach constructed in this study, the possibility of fault detection and diagnosis was demonstrated for virtual EMAs of a liquid rocket engine. © 2019 IEEE.","","Boosters (rocket); Computer simulation languages; Decision making; Digital storage; Electromechanical actuators; Electromechanical devices; Embedded systems; Failure (mechanical); Failure modes; Health; Liquids; Maintenance; Modeling languages; Reusability; Reusable rockets; Condition based maintenance; Dynamic time warping algorithms; Fault detection and diagnosis; Hier-archical clustering; Maintenance decision making; Object-oriented modeling languages; Prognostics and health managements; System-level interactions; Fault detection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068348472"

Results acquired from an internal Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) study identified turn-to-turn winding faults as the primary mechanism, or mode, of failure. Physics-of-failure mechanisms used to develop a model for the identified fault are provided. Then, an experimental test procedure was devised and executed to validate the model. Additionally, a diagnostic feature, identified by the fault model and derived using Hilbert transform theory, was validated using the system model and experimental data for several fault dimensions. Next, a feature extraction routine preprocesses monitoring parameters and passes the resulting features to a particle filter.

One way to reduce these costs would be to implement a structural health and prognostic management (SHPM) system as part of a condition based maintenance paradigm with smart load management. To facilitate the development of such a system a multiscale modeling approach has been developed to identify how the underlying physics of the system are affected by the presence of damage and faults, and how these changes manifest themselves in the operational response of a full turbine. This methodology was used to perform a sensitivity analysis, investigating several inflow conditions in an effort to validate rotor imbalance and shear web disbond detection strategies developed in past efforts. Based on an aerodynamic sensitivity analysis of the model, the operational measurements used for the pilot study in the detection of pitch error, mass imbalance, and shear web disbond were validated. Detection strategies were refined for these fault mechanisms and probabilities of detection were calculated. For all three fault mechanisms, the probability of detection was 96% or higher for the optimized wind speed ranges of the laminar, 30% horizontal shear, and 60% horizontal shear wind profiles. The integration of the health monitoring information provides the initial steps to reducing operations and maintenance costs for an offshore wind farm while increasing turbine availability and overall profit.","","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84894416423"

The azimuthal propagation resistivity tools all use the concept of multi-spacings, multi-frequencies, and multi-components. The measurements acquired by the tool are much richer than that of the conventional omni-directional propagation resistivity. The applications of the new service are widely ranged from the well placement, the reservoir mapping, the geo-stopping, the landing, the fault detection to the salt edge detection, etc. However, due to the complexity of the measurement physics, the tool response characteristics and the data processing/inversion, without the well understanding the uncertainty of the service, operators do not have sufficient confidence to use the service as much as expected. To promote the understanding of the technology and clear many questions surfing around the industry, in this paper, we systematically study the sensitivity and quantify the uncertainty of the azimuthal propagation resistivity technology in various formation model. The sensitivity of the measurements to the dip angle, the anisotropy, the layer boundaries, and the formation resistivity is essential to assess the capability of the technology for practical applications such as the reservoir boundary mapping, the formation evaluation and the well placement. A group of studies is conducted to evaluate the sensitivity under several common situations including homogeneous isotropy formation, homogeneous anisotropy formation, and layered formation. The information content of the measurements and the proper use of the measurements is clearly demonstrated. The depth of detection (DoD) in a two-layer formation presented in the format of “Picasso” plot is studied. The common practice to produce “Picasso” plot is based on the noise threshold of the measurement which is not always realistic. It only reflects the quality of the measurements rather than the quality (error bar) of the distance to boundary (D2B) resulting from the inversion processing. D2B-error-based DoD is investigated in the paper. The comparison between these two methods reveals the commonly used, noise-based DoD is considerably overestimated. A set of 1D formation models, proposed by SPWLA Resistivity Special Interest Group (RtSIG) chapter, is used to quantify the uncertainty of the bed boundary position, the formation resistivity, the dip angle through a novel statistical analysis, the trans-dimensional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (tMCMC) method. The probability maps of the boundary interface and the distribution of the resistivity profile can be extracted from the statistical characteristics of the posterior probability distribution (PPD). The exercise of the statistical solver on the formation models recommended by SPWLA RtSIG demonstrates that the uncertainty quantification techniques can be crucial to assess the azimuthal propagation resistivity technology. A field example from a subsea gas well of Wheatstone liquefied-natural-gas project in Western Australia is used to confirm the importance of the uncertainty quantification in evaluating the capacity of the azimuthal propagation resistivity measurements.

Fault detection, isolation and estimation (FDIE) are accomplished through the integration of reduced-order physics models with a new observer-based parameter identification algorithm that directly estimates changes in structural stiffness and damping. In the proposed method, each building floor is connected to its adjoining floors using springs and dampers (i.e., structure columns) to capture the planar motion of the system. The novelty in this method is that the structure features of stiffness and damping are directly estimated from the observer model states. To demonstrate the proposed method, a finite element analysis of a scaled digital building is used to generate dynamic structural data. The simulated data will be corrupted to emulate sensor noise. It will be shown that for this numerical study a 15% stiffness change in one of the nine columns between the floors that produces 1.67% decrease in overall stiffness is detected. It will be also shown that the proposed approach is able to detect, isolate and estimate faults of different magnitudes at single and multiple locations. © 2018","Adaptive model; And finite element analysis; Damage detection; Multistory building; Sensor noise; Structural health monitoring","Damage detection; Damping; Data reduction; Fault detection; Floors; Stiffness; Structural health monitoring; Tall buildings; Adaptive modeling; Multistory building; Parameter identification algorithms; Sensor noise; Stiffness and damping; Structural health monitoring (SHM); Structural stiffness; Structure features; Finite element method","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056173188"

Chief among the advantages are adaptability to the measured response of a building and conciseness in computer implementation. Important applications will include automated fault detection. One of the most important aspects of a successful building energy model is the ability to accurately account for the heat capacity of the structure, especially the envelope. As part of the development of a simplified physics-based building energy model, a variety of roof and wall models were considered. Three different generic models were considered for opaque walls and roofs (1) an analytical model with closed-form solution, (2) a time-series solution using the ASHRAE transfer function method, and (3) a lumped capacity model with various numbers of capacitive nodes. This paper will describe an investigation of various simplified models for the transient conduction through building walls. Specifically, how different kinds of wall constructions and materials can change when the conduction load passes through the wall and when it impacts the HVAC system. Understanding how the physics of dynamic envelope loading can change how much energy a building uses for heating or cooling and when room conditioning loads occur is vital for energy savings and proper modeling.

These methods do not also offer adequate information about the faults, especially, if these faults at subsurface or not clearly evident.

However, an unforeseen robot shutdown has the potential to cause an interruption in the entire production line, resulting in significant unplanned downtime, economic, production losses, and even work injuries. Thus, it is of high interest to detect incipient faults in industrial robots before they totally shut down or otherwise fail. A challenge for fault detection in industrial robots is the difficulty to obtain sufficient labeled training data under normal and abnormal health conditions. Thus, unsupervised machine learning algorithms are desired. In this work, a Gaussian mixture model-based unsupervised fault detection framework is proposed to effectively detect the faults in industrial robots using current signals. Signal preprocessing is first performed to clean the measured raw current signals.

In the traditional data-driven GPR method, the form of the Gaussian Process auto- and cross-covariance functions is assumed and its parameters are found from measurements. In the physics-informed GPR, we treat unknown variables (including wind speed and mechanical power) as a random process and compute the auto and cross-covariance functions from the resulting stochastic power grid equations. We demonstrate that the physics-informed GPR method is significantly more accurate than the standard data-driven one for immediate forecasting of generators' angular velocity and phase angle. We also show that the physics-informed GPR provides accurate predictions of the unobserved wind mechanical power, phase angle, or angular velocity when measurements from only one of these variables are available. The immediate forecast of observed variables and predictions of unobserved variables can be used for effectively managing power grids (electricity market clearing, regulation actions) and early detection of abnormal behavior and faults. The physics-based GPR forecast time horizon depends on the combination of input (wind power, load, etc.) correlation time and characteristic (relaxation) time of the power grid and can be extended to short and medium-range times. © 2019 IEEE Computer Society.

Estimated energy models can be used for a large variety of management and control tasks, spanning from model predictive building control to estimation of energy consumption and user behavior. In practical implementation, problems to be considered are the fact that some measurements of relevance are missing and must be estimated, and the fact that other measurements, collected at low sampling rate to save memory, make discretization of physics-based models critical. These problems make classical estimation tools inadequate and call for appropriate dual estimation schemes where states and parameters of a system are estimated simultaneously. In this work we develop dual estimation schemes based on Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filtering (UKF) for constructing building energy models from data: in order to cope with the low sampling rate of data (with sampling time 15 min), an implicit discretization (Euler backward method) is adopted to discretize the continuous-time heat transfer dynamics. It is shown that explicit discretization methods like the Euler forward method, combined with 15 min sampling time, are ineffective for building reliable energy models (the discrete-time dynamics do not match the continuous-time ones): even explicit methods of higher order like the Runge-Kutta method fail to provide a good approximation of the continuous-time dynamics which such large sampling time. Either smaller time steps or alternative discretization methods are required. We verify that the implicit Euler backward method provides good approximation of the continuous-time dynamics and can be easily implemented for our dual estimation purposes. The applicability of the proposed method in terms of estimation of both states and parameters is demonstrated via simulations and using historical data from a real-life building. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Building energy model; Dual estimation; Low sampling rate","Behavioral research; Buildings; Continuous time systems; Discrete event simulation; Dynamics; Energy utilization; Extended Kalman filters; Fault detection; Heat transfer; Kalman filters; Runge Kutta methods; Volume measurement; Building energy model; Continuous-time dynamics; Dual estimation; Extended Kalman filtering; Fault detection and diagnosis; Management and controls; Sampling rates; Unscented Kalman filtering; building; energy use; estimation method; heat transfer; numerical method; numerical model; sampling; Parameter estimation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84958214760"

They follow two general approaches, data-driven, and physics-based. The first approach uses deviations of monitored variables from their baseline values. A diagnostic decision is traditionally made in the space of these deviations (diagnostic features) by pattern recognition techniques, for example, artificial neural networks. The necessary fault classes can be constructed from deviation vectors (patterns) using the displays of real faults, and the approach has a theoretical possibility to exclude a complex physics-based model and its inherent errors from a diagnostic process. For the second approach known as a gas path analysis, a nonlinear physics-based model (a.k.a. thermodynamic model) is an integral part of a diagnostic process. The thermodynamic model (or the corresponding linear model) relates monitored variables with operational conditions and model's internal quantities called fault parameters. The identification of the thermodynamic model on the basis of known measurements of the monitored variables and operational conditions allows estimating unknown fault parameters. The knowledge of these parameters drastically simplifies a final diagnostic decision because great values of these parameters indicate damaged engine components and give us the measure of damage severity. As the diagnostic decision seems to be simple, the studies following this approach are usually completed by the analysis of fault parameter estimation accuracy, and complex pattern recognition techniques are not employed. Instead, simple tolerance-based fault detection and isolation is sometimes performed. It is not clear from known comparative studies which of the two approaches is more accurate, and the issue of seems to be challenging. This paper tries to solve this problem, being grounded on the following principles. We consider that a key difference of the second approach is a transformation from the diagnostic space of the deviations of monitored variables to the space of fault parameters. To evaluate the influence of this transformation on diagnostic accuracy, the other steps of the approaches should be equal. To this end, the pattern recognition technique employed in the data-driven approach is also included in the physics-based approach where it is applied to recognize fault parameter patterns instead of a tolerance-based rule. To realize and compare the data-driven and modified physics-based approaches, two corresponding diagnostic procedures differing only by the mentioned transformation have been developed. They use the same set of deviation vectors of healthy and faulty engines as input data and finally compute true classification rates that are employed to compare the procedures. The results obtained for different cases of the present comparative study show that the classification rates are practically the same for these procedures, and this is true for both fault detection and fault isolation. That is, correct classification does not depend on the mentioned transformation, and both approaches are equal from the standpoint of the classification accuracy of engine states.

Such systems have the potential to enable buildings to meet energy management goals of reducing total energy consumption and cost. Most current market offerings use data-driven and rule-based analytics. However, the use of physics-based models in the analytics offers potential improvements by providing an accurate estimation of outputs based on representation of the physical principles governing the building system behaviors. This also permits the use of design stage models to inform commissioning and operation. This paper describes the development and testing of a hybrid data-driven and physics model-based operational tool for energy efficiency in central cooling plants. The tool offers FDD functionality, setpoint optimization, and visualization of key performance parameters. It was demonstrated at a university campus in the mixed-humid ASHRAE Climate Zone 4A. Key performance metrics that were analyzed include plant electricity use reduction, plant model calibration, and system economics. Annual simulations indicate the tool can provide electricity savings of greater than 10% for approximately six months of the year, mainly during the winter season when wet bulb temperatures are low, though only 1.38% savings for the entire year. Additionally, over a 4-day period in April, recommended optimal setpoints were implemented, resulting in 17% savings versus metered baseline consumption. With respect to model calibration, the difference between model-predicted and measured parameters was less than 10% for 90% of data points acquired for three of six chillers, and for each ten cooling towers.

This means that extreme and varying loads experienced by WT components need to be accounted for as well as gaining access to wind farms (WFs) at different times of the year. Condition monitoring (CM) is used by WF owners to assess WT health by detecting gearbox failures and planning for operations and maintenance (O&M). However, there are several challenges and limitations with commercially available CM technologies - ranging from the cost of installing monitoring systems to the ability to detect faults accurately. This study seeks to address some of these challenges by developing novel techniques for fault detection using the RMS and Extreme (peak) values of vibration signals. The proposed techniques are based on three models (signal correlation, extreme vibration, and RMS intensity) and have been validated with a time domain data driven approach using CM data of operational WTs. The findings of this study show that monitoring RMS and Extreme values serves as a leading indicator for early detection of faults using Extreme value theory, giving WF owners time to schedule O&M. Furthermore, it also indicates that the prediction accuracy of each CM technique depends on the physics of failure. This suggests that an approach which incorporates the strengths of multiple techniques is needed for holistic health assessment of WT components. © 2016 The Authors.","Condition monitoring; Condition-based maintenance; Extreme value theory; Gearboxes; RMS vibrations","Condition monitoring; Fault detection; Vibration analysis; Wind power; Wind turbines; Condition based maintenance; Environmental conditions; Extreme value theory; Gearboxes; Operations and maintenance; Prediction accuracy; RMS vibrations; Wind turbine gearboxes; accuracy assessment; cost analysis; failure analysis; installation; model validation; monitoring system; operations technology; prediction; renewable resource; vibration; wind farm; wind turbine; Time domain analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84954469885"

But this approach is lacking in several respects: there are a myriad of fault types and severities that must be hypothesized, each nuclear plant is unique and requires a plant-specific model, plant physics change with time requiring model maintenance, and such model development and maintenance requires a specialist at a time that utilities are shedding such specialists. An alternate approach that does not suffer from these limitations involves the use of a data-driven model in conjunction with the physical conservation laws written as confluence equations. The reasoning process produces very nearly the same qualitative reasoning process that the operator would use if he were to make a fault diagnosis given sufficient time. This approach is described along with its application to the chemical and volume control system of a pressurized water reactor.","Conservation; Diagnosis; Equipment; Fault","Artificial intelligence; Conservation; Diagnosis; Equipment; Failure analysis; Faulting; Man machine systems; Pressurized water reactors; Alternate approaches; Chemical and volume control systems; Data-driven model; Equipment fault diagnosis; First principle modeling; Model maintenance; Qualitative reasoning; Reasoning process; Fault detection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84946150340"

The three methods are a data driven approach developed by the Linz Center of Mechatronics (LCM), an physics based method of Flanders Make (FM) and an approach developed by the Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS). Two experimental tests have been performed, an accelerated life time test to degrade a bearing and introduce an operational bearing fault and a gearbox test containing various faulty test bearings. The methods are compared based on their diagnostic performance, practical applicability, training and configuration requirements. Based on the accelerated life time test, it is concluded that the method of IMS and FM, employing bearing specific features, showed to be more sensitive for early bearing fault detection than purely statistical features used in the method of LCM. On the contrary, the method of LCM does not require specific system knowledge and is not limited to bearing monitoring only. The method is more widely applicable to fault monitoring problems. The methods of IMS and LCM seem to outperform the method of FM in the gearbox test. However, the training and testing data used by those methods were acquired for the same bearing sample and for the same bearing assembly. This could lead to a high correlation between the training and testing data and hence a misleading classification accuracy. Therefore, attention should be paid to the quality of the training data. It is concluded that the training data should comprise all relevant system variations, including e.g. remounting of the bearing, to ensure that the classification is uniquely based on bearing fault related effects. The methods of IMS and LCM require validated training data of both healthy and faulty bearing scenarios, whereas the method of FM relies on training data of healthy bearings only. In practice, the availability of training data of faulty bearings is often scarce and could make the adoption more complicated. The findings presented in this paper serve as a guideline to support the selection of an appropriate method for practical applications. © 2019, Prognostics and Health Management Society.

This requires both, the engineering of reliable features and a good methodology for their analysis. If traditionally, features were engineered based on the physics of the system, recent advances in machine learning demonstrated that features could be automatically learned and monitored. In particular, using Hierarchical Extreme Learning Machines (HELM), based on random features, very good results have already been achieved for health monitoring with training on healthy data only. Yet, although very useful and mathematically sound, random features have little popularity as they contradict the intuition and seem to rely on luck. This tends to increase the “black-box” effect often associated with Machine Learning. To mitigate this, in this paper, we propose to modify the traditional HELM architecture such that, while still relying on random features, only the most useful features among a large population will be selected. Traditional HELM are made of stacked contractive autoencoders with `1- or `2-regularisation and of a classifier as last layer. To achieve our objective, we propose to opt for expanding auto-encoders instead, but trained with a strong Group-LASSO regularization. This Group-LASSO regularisation fosters the selection of as few features as possible, making the auto-encoder in reality (or in testing condition) contractive. This deterministic selection provides useful features for health monitoring, without the need of learning or manually engineering them. The proposed approach demonstrates a better performance for fault detection and isolation on case studies developed for HELM evaluation. © 2018 Prognostics and Health Management Society.

However, most AE based methodologies to date are data-driven technologies. This research takes a new approach combining a heterodyne based frequency reduction technique, time synchronous resampling (TSR), and spectral averaging to process AE signals and extract condition indicators (CIs) for bearing fault diagnosis. The heterodyne technique allows the AE signal frequency to be shifted from several MHz to less than 50 kHz, which is comparable to that of vibration based techniques. Then, the digitized signal is band pass filtered to retain the information associated with the bearing defects. Finally, the tachometer signal is used to time synchronously resample the AE data to allow the computation of a spectral average and the extraction of CIs for bearing fault diagnosis. The presented technique is validated using the AE signals of seeded fault steel bearings on a bearing test rig. The result is an effective physics based approach validated to diagnose all four fault types: inner race, outer race, ball, and cage.","Acoustic Emission Sensor; Bearing; Fault Diagnosis","Acoustic emission testing; Bearings (structural); Failure analysis; Heterodyning; Information filtering; Machinery; Signal processing; Acoustic emission sensors; Bearing fault diagnosis; Bearing fault diagnostics; Condition indicators; Frequency reduction; Heterodyne technique; Spectral averages; Spectral averaging; Fault detection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84938933319"

The use of frequency features and time-frequency features for machinery fault diagnosis has been prevalent in the last decade. However, more attentions have been drawn to machine learning based features recently. While frequency domain features can be directly correlated to fault type and fault level, statistical features are typically abstract representations. Most existing machine learning methods are based on supervised learning scheme to classify these abstract features for diagnostic purpose. Since labeled training data can be unreliable and hard to obtain, unsupervised fault diagnosis methods are often more desirable. Traditionally, only physics-based condition indicators can be used directly to indicate fault level and fault type. This paper aims to evaluate some of the unsupervised feature extraction methods by deep learning for 'meaningful' feature mining, i.e., disentangle and extract features that are related to the faults. We name this type of feature extraction method as disentangled tone mining (DTM), where each tone in the present work refers to certain latent structure in the spectrum. This paper has shown that fully unsupervised methods can potentially extract the 'trend' for machine health state, which can be used directly in on-line anomaly detection or prediction. Although not fully understood yet, the experimental results indicate that unsupervised deep sparse autoencoder can disentangle the fault related features from uncorrelated noise and self-track the potential fault evolution process. © 2018 IEEE.","deep sparse autoencoder; fault level; gear; pitting detection","Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Extraction; Failure analysis; Feature extraction; Frequency domain analysis; Gears; Learning algorithms; Machinery; Abstract representation; Auto encoders; Fault diagnosis method; Fault levels; Feature extraction methods; Machine learning methods; Machinery fault diagnosis; Time frequency features; Fault detection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050732145"

Traditional fault isolation methods often utilize a Single Fault Isolator (SFI) that primarily relies on gas path performance parameters.

We describe a logic program called the Qualitative Behavioral Analyzer (QBA) for monitoring a controlled physical process on an unrouted Modbus network. The proposed approach uses knowledge of process physics to identify a possible component fault or cyberattack. To avoid relying on the integrity of the master unit, the QBA directly analyzes Modbus network traffic.

While non-destructive testing has become state of the art, there is a trend towards online testing on demand using built-in sensors. A vast amount of in-service monitoring, as part of structural health monitoring, uses piezoelectric elements. Their deployment requires a control of the sensor performance in order to prevent false alarm. Several kinds of damage can influence the sensor performance, for example, degradation of piezoceramic or adhesive, debonding or breakage of the element. Therefore, this paper aims to detect damage of circular piezoelectric elements and their bonding layers during in-service monitoring. For this purpose, a local method, using the coupled electro-mechanical admittance, is proposed. However, changing environmental and operational conditions such as temperature have an effect on the measured quantities, masking the damage. To cope with this, the dynamic behaviour of an attached piezoelectric element including temperature trends is modelled to enable physics-based temperature compensation. This novel combination of an improved analytical model, updated according to impedance measurements, realizes a method less dependent on experimental baseline data, than the sole comparison of experimental data, established in many monitoring systems. By comparison with experimentally obtained electro-mechanical susceptance the physical model of circular piezoelectric elements is validated. The feasibility of the proposed method is presented employing experimental data of piezoelectric elements mounted on aluminium coupons, partly damaged with degradation and sensor breakage. The application produces promising results, detecting the created defects. © The Author(s) 2013.","changing environmental conditions; circular piezoelectric elements; electro-mechanical impedance; lead zirconium titanate; model-based sensor fault detection; piezoelectric wafer active sensor; signal processing; Structural health monitoring","Nondestructive examination; Piezoelectric ceramics; Piezoelectric devices; Signal processing; Structural health monitoring; Electromechanical impedance; Environmental conditions; Lead zirconium titanate; Piezoelectric elements; Piezoelectric wafer active sensors; Sensor fault detection; Sensors","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84897658025"

In addition to efficiency, a successful methodology for industrial applications should be also characterized by ease of implementation and operation. To this purpose, a comprehensive and straightforward approach for Detection, Classification and Integrated Diagnostics of Gas Turbine Sensors (named DCIDS) is proposed in this paper. The tool consists of two main algorithms, i.e. the Anomaly Detection Algorithm (ADA) and the Anomaly Classification Algorithm (ACA). The ADA identifies anomalies according to three different levels of filtering based on gross physics threshold application, inter-sensor statistical analysis (sensor voting) and single-sensor statistical analysis. Anomalies in the time series are identified by the ADA, together with their characteristics, which are analyzed by the ACA to perform their classification. Fault classes discriminate among anomalies according to their time correlation, magnitude and number of sensors in which an anomaly is contemporarily identified. Results of anomaly identification and classification can subsequently be used for sensor diagnostic purposes. The performance of the tool is assessed in this paper by analyzing two temperature time series with redundant sensors taken on a Siemens gas turbine in operation. The results show that the DICDS is able to identify and classify different types of anomalies. In particular, in the first dataset, two severely incoherent sensors are identified and their anomalies are correctly classified. In the second dataset, the DCIDS tool proves to be capable of identifying and classifying clustered spikes of different magnitudes.

Thus, a reduction in unexpected bearing failures will lead to an increase in machine availability, a reduction in maintenance and downtime costs, and an improvement in customer satisfaction. Over the past few decades, deep learning has been recognized as a useful tool for fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings. Although existing deep learning approaches can achieve satisfactory accuracy in bearing fault diagnosis, most of these approaches rely exclusively on data and do not incorporate physical knowledge into the learning and prediction processes. To address this challenge, this study develops a deep learning-based fault diagnosis approach by proposing a novel physics-based feature weighting (PFW) technique. The proposed PFW technique leverages the fault characteristic frequencies of a bearing to weigh the vibration features based on the amount of fault-related information that they are expected to carry. The weight learning component of PFW comes from the ability to learn (or optimize) the parameters of the weighting functions while training a deep learning model. The performance of the developed approach with the proposed PFW technique is compared with that of traditional convolutional neural network. © International Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring.

Connector contact degradation has a significant effect on signal transmissions. This paper considers experimental measurements, simulations, and analyses of the high-frequency behaviors of degraded coaxial connector. An experimental investigation was first performed to evaluate how degraded contact surfaces affect the return loss and insertion loss of connectors. It was found that both the input return loss and the insertion loss are frequency-dependent. As the contact surface degrades, the return loss decreases and the insertion loss increases at lower frequencies, with the effect of the degradation becoming smaller with increasing frequency. A 3-D field simulation was developed to evaluate the high-frequency performance of various contact cases. Based on the simulation results, the electrical parameters of the dielectric film were extracted for connectors with different degradation levels. According to the transmission line theory and the contact physics, a high-frequency equivalent model of the degraded coaxial connector was developed and analyzed. This model is helpful in developing a better understanding of possible failure modes and in identifying failure features in fault diagnosis. © 2011-2012 IEEE.","Coaxial connector degradation; electrical contact; insertion loss (IL); return loss","Contacts (fluid mechanics); Degradation; Dielectric films; Electric fault currents; Electric lines; Fault detection; Scattering parameters; Coaxial connectors; Electrical contacts; Pins; Ports (Computers); Return loss; Transmission-line measurements; Insertion losses","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85039787053"

The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the potential of a physics-based model (PbM) for prognostics with a real case study, based on the detection of incipient faults and estimate the remaining useful life of a planetary transmission of an aircraft system. Design/methodology/approach - Most of the research in the area of health assessment algorithms has been focused on data-driven approaches that are not based on the knowledge of the physics of the system, while PbM approaches rely on the understanding of the system and the degradation mechanisms. A physics-based modelling approach to represent metal-metal contact and fatigue in the gears of the planetary transmission of an aircraft system is applied. Findings - Both the failure mode caused by metal-metal contact as caused by fatigue in the gears is described. Furthermore, the real-time application that retrieves the results from the simulations to assess the health of the system is described.

We conducted the investigations of harmonic, inter-harmonic, and sub-harmonic contents for FD purposes. The harmonics in the flux leakage spectrum appear as a result of diverse causes including stator fault, DTC reaction to the fault, switching activities, and core saturation effect. Physics-based co-simulation was held through the coupling between a finite-element model (FEM) of the faulty IM and the circuit simulation of DTC. Its advantages are: 1) the IM harmonic contents including stator slots, rotor slots, saturation, switching activity, and fault are simulated and 2) dangerous experimentations of a faulty IM can be avoided. Therefore, we can safely study all the characteristics on a faulty IM. We exploited FEM for the verification of the experimental harmonic signatures of the scattered magnetic field. We verified the online FD technique based on the radiated magnetic field's spectrum through the co-simulation and experimental results. This indicated that the method is able to correctly detect the ITSC faults with 1% severity factor. © 1965-2012 IEEE.","Direct torque control (DTC); external magnetic field; finite-element model (FEM); induction motor (IM); inter-turn short circuit (ITSC)","Circuit simulation; Electric machine control; Fault detection; Finite difference method; Harmonic analysis; Induction motors; Magnetic fields; Stators; Torque control; Direct torque control; External magnetic field; Harmonic contents; Inter-turn short circuit; Magnetic signatures; On-line fault detection; Stator fault detection; Switching activities; Finite element method","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064996183"

As part of the digital twin concept, methodologies are developed by using integrated multiphysics models, sensor information and input data from an in-service vehicle to mirror and predict the life of its corresponding physical twin. SHM tools are necessary for both damage diagnostics and prognostics for continued safe operation of damaged aircraft structures. The adverse conditions include loss of control caused by environmental factors, actuator and sensor faults or failures, and structural damage conditions. A major concern in these structures is the growth of undetected damage/cracks due to fatigue and low velocity foreign object impact that can reach a critical size during flight, resulting in loss of control of the aircraft. To avoid unstable, catastrophic propagation of damage during a flight, load levels must be maintained that are below a reduced load-carrying capacity for continued safe operation of an aircraft. Hence, a capability is needed for accurate real-time predictions of damage size and safe load carrying capacity for structures with complex damage configurations. In the present work, a procedure is developed that uses guided wave responses to interrogate damage. As the guided wave interacts with damage, the signal attenuates in some directions and reflects in others. This results in a difference in signal magnitude as well as phase shifts between signal responses for damaged and undamaged structures. Accurate estimation of damage size, location, and orientation is made by evaluating the cumulative signal responses at various pre-selected sensor locations using a genetic algorithm (GA) based optimization procedure. The damage size, location, and orientation is obtained by minimizing the difference between the reference responses and the responses obtained by wave propagation finite element analysis of different representative cracks, geometries, and sizes. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Currently, experts, in their respective fields, devise these features based on their knowledge. Hence, the performance and usefulness depends on the expert's knowledge of the underlying physics or statistics. Furthermore, if new and additional conditions should be detectable, experts have to implement new feature extraction methods. To mitigate the drawbacks of feature engineering, a method from the subfield of feature learning, i.e., deep learning (DL), more specifically convolutional neural networks (NNs), is researched in this paper. The objective of this paper is to investigate if and how DL can be applied to infrared thermal (IRT) video to automatically determine the condition of the machine. By applying this method on IRT data in two use cases, i.e., machine-fault detection and oil-level prediction, we show that the proposed system is able to detect many conditions in rotating machinery very accurately (i.e., 95 and 91.67% accuracy for the respective use cases), without requiring any detailed knowledge about the underlying physics, and thus having the potential to significantly simplify condition monitoring using complex sensor data. Furthermore, we show that by using the trained NNs, important regions in the IRT images can be identified related to specific conditions, which can potentially lead to new physical insights. © 2017 IEEE.","Fault detection; machine learning algorithms; neural networks; preventive maintenance","Artificial intelligence; Complex networks; Condition monitoring; Deep neural networks; Education; Extraction; Fault detection; Feature extraction; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machinery; Neural networks; Convolutional neural network; Feature engineerings; Feature extraction methods; Infrared thermal image; Machine health monitoring; Measured signals; Trained neural networks; Vibrations; Deep learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85023191940"

The methods of recurrence plots (RPs) and statistical measurement have been used as data-driven tools for diagnostics with no possibility of classifying the nature of defect and poor ability to localize it. In order to enhance the efficiency of the forecast, innovative approaches consist of using physics-based features to train a data-based assessment methods. This requires proper analysis of the physical system using appropriate methods. For this purpose, this paper focusses on the bifurcation dynamics of nonlinear systems using the recurrence and statistical methods. Considering the nonlinear pendulum as a model, the qualitative behavior of the system is discussed through the bifurcation diagram of some recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) parameters, namely the recurrence rate, determinism, and laminarity. These parameters are used to measure the level of complexity and transition from regular to chaotic motion and vice versa. Statistical parameters such as crest factor, skewness, and kurtosis are used to identify various bifurcation and amplitudes in the system, and to measure the orientation and the level of asymmetry. Plots of recurrence diagrams and histograms are presented to support our observations. Examples of detection of dynamic changes using these two methods are provided. The interesting results obtained in this paper show that statistical methods complement results obtained from RPs. In addition, the paper demonstrates how the RPs can be employed in conjunction with the physics-based model. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Fault detection; Recurrence analysis; Statistical analysis; Time-series analysis","Fault detection; Higher order statistics; Pendulums; Speech processing; Statistical methods; Bifurcation analysis; Innovative approaches; Non-linear pendulum; Physics-based modeling; Qualitative behavior; Recurrence analysis; Recurrence quantification analysis; Statistical parameters; Bifurcation (mathematics)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84902540346"

Modern computing capabilities allow for more and more complex tools for engine monitoring and diagnostics. Nevertheless, an underlying physics-based approach is often preferable, because not only the “what” but also the “why” can be identified, providing an effective decision support tool to the service engineer. In this work, a physics-based adaptive model is used to evaluate performance deltas and correct the data to reference conditions (gas turbine load and ambient conditions), while a data-driven correlation algorithm identifies the most likely matches within a fault signatures database. Possible faults are ordered from the highest correlation in the decision support system and the most likely fault can be selected based on the number of occurrences and the associated correlation. Gradual engine degradation can also be monitored by displaying performance deltas trends during time. The diagnostics tool was tested on a validated performance model of a single-shaft industrial gas turbine and subsequently on experimental data. This paper presents the diagnostics system structure, the model adaptation scheme, and the results obtained from simulated and real fault data. Accurate fault isolation and severity identification were achieved in all cases, demonstrating the tool capability for decision support system.

It is based on a further development of the recently introduced data analytics framework (TEDA-from typicality and eccentricity data analytics). We compare TEDA with the traditional statistical approach and prove that TEDA is a generalization of it in regards to the well-known 'nσ' analysis (TEDA gives exactly the same result as the traditional 'nσ' analysis but it does not require the restrictive prior assumptions that are made for the traditional approach to be in place). Moreover, it offers a non-parametric, closed form analytical descriptions (models of the data distribution) to be extracted from the real data realizations, not to be pre-assumed. In addition to that, for several types of proximity/similarity measures (such as Euclidean, cosine, Mahalonobis) it can be calculated recursively, thus, computationally very efficiently and is suitable for real time and online algorithms. Building on the per data sample, exact information about the data distribution in a closed analytical form, in this paper we propose a new less conservative and more sensitive condition for anomaly detection. It is quite different from the traditional 'nσ' type conditions. We demonstrate example where traditional conditions would lead to an increased amount of false negatives or false positives in comparison with the proposed condition. The new condition is intuitive and easy to check for arbitrary data distribution and arbitrary small (but not less than 3) amount of data samples/points. Finally, because the anomaly/novelty/change detection is very important and basic data analysis operation which is in the fundament of such higher level tasks as fault detection, drift detection in data streams, clustering, outliers detection, autonomous video analytics, particle physics, etc. we point to some possible applications which will be the domain of future work. © 2014 IEEE.","Anomaly/novelty/change/outliers detection; Data density; Data streams; Eccentricity; TEDA; Typicality","Algorithms; Data communication systems; Fault detection; Data density; Data stream; Eccentricity; TEDA; Typicality; Data mining","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84946693632"

Physics-based modeling and root-cause analysis of failure sites, failure modes, and failure mechanisms have proven to be effective in the prevention and fault detection of product failures over the past decades. Nevertheless, prognostics and health management (PHM) is now the focus of recent activity as noted by the amount of books, articles, and patents. This three-part review aims to give a comprehensive overview of PHM patents from three aspects: PHM for electrical systems, PHM for mechanical systems, and general PHM methodologies. This series of survey papers reviews the history of PHM research in industry and its current status based on U.S. patents from 2000 to 2015; discusses the application of PHM in the design, manufacture, and deployment of equipment in various industries; and presents some of the key research questions which remain to be addressed, with particular attention on the results reported in the last decade. In this part, 114 PHM patents for electrical systems are covered and comprehensively reviewed from the perspective of seven electrical appliances. Several phenomena are summarized through the investigation of U.S. PHM patents from 2000 to 2015. The proportion of the PHM patents for systems increased much more than for components. Compared with single sensor, sensor networks have achieved more applications so that objects are monitored more comprehensively and accurately. In addition, online assessment with on-board solutions is gradually replacing offline assessment of products using downloaded data to realize timely monitoring and troubleshooting. © 2013 IEEE.","application; electrical systems; patents; prognostics and health management (PHM); Reliability assessment and prediction","Analytical models; Applications; Degradation; Electric load management; Fault detection; Health; Maintainability; Manufacture; Product design; Reliability; Reliability analysis; Sensor networks; Systems engineering; Electrical systems; Load modeling; Patents; Prognostics and health managements; Reliability assessments; Patents and inventions","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044736800"

This paper shows how estimated friction parameters and flow rates can be used to detect and isolate the type of incident, as well as isolating the position of a defect. Estimates are shown to be subjected to non-Gaussian, t-distributed noise, and a dedicated multivariate statistical change detection approach is used that detects and isolates faults by detecting simultaneous changes in estimated parameters and flow rates. The properties of the multivariate diagnosis method are analyzed, and it is shown how detection and false alarm probabilities are assessed and optimized using data-based learning to obtain thresholds for hypothesis testing.

In addition, an accurate parameter estimation technique is proposed for this new model based on the pattern search optimization algorithm. The usual characterization of the I-V curves has five unknown parameters. The majority of the estimation techniques identify those five parameters for a specific irradiance and temperature. This means that different sets of five parameters are found for each environmental condition, i.e., the estimated parameters are based only on a mathematical fitting with lack of physical meaning. In the proposed eight-parameter adaptive model, it is necessary to execute the parameter estimation technique only once, because the model is valid for all ranges of values of the environmental conditions available on datasheets or experimental curves. Moreover, the restrictions imposed on each parameter make the model capable of emulating the physical behavior of the PV module, particularly useful in fault diagnosis and predictive and corrective maintenance of PV systems. Comparison results based on datasheet and experimental curves are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and parameter estimation technique. © 2011-2012 IEEE.","Adaptive estimation; photovoltaic (PV) cells; PV systems","Equivalent circuits; Estimation; Fault detection; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Photovoltaic effects; Timing circuits; Adaptive estimation; Corrective maintenance; Environmental conditions; Estimation techniques; Pattern search optimizations; Photovoltaic; Photovoltaic modules; PV system; Parameter estimation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85028818121"

However, traditional intrusion detection systems for the IT domain are not entirely suitable for industrial process automation. In this paper, multiple models are constructed by comprehensively analyzing the multidomain knowledge of field control layers in industrial process automation, with consideration of two aspects: physics and information. And then, a novel multimodel-based anomaly intrusion detection system with embedded intelligence and resilient coordination for the field control system in industrial process automation is designed. In the system, an anomaly detection based on multimodel is proposed, and the corresponding intelligent detection algorithms are designed. Furthermore, to overcome the disadvantages of anomaly detection, a classifier based on an intelligent hidden Markov model, is designed to differentiate the actual attacks from faults. Finally, based on a combination simulation platform using optimized performance network engineering tool, the detection accuracy and the real-Time performance of the proposed intrusion detection system are analyzed in detail.

Accurate failure detection and life prediction methods also result in reduced maintenance costs. The major challenges in fleet monitoring are the great amount of collected data that need to be processed and the variability between engines of the fleet, which requires adaptive models. In this paper, a framework for monitoring, diagnostics, and health management of a fleet of aircrafts is proposed. The framework consists of a multi-level approach: starting from thresholds exceedance monitoring, problematic engines are isolated, on which a fault detection system is then applied. Different methods for fault isolation, identification, and quantification are presented and compared, and the related challenges and opportunities are discussed. This conceptual strategy is tested on fleet data generated through a performance model of a turbofan engine, considering engine-to-engine and flight-to-flight variations and uncertainties in sensor measurements.

This paradigm-shift benefits from new algorithms that can be implemented at the grid edge (as opposed to the transmission grid) to detect anomalies faster, more efficiently, and in real-time. Micro-PMUs are phasor measurement units that can be placed on the distribution lines to provide real-time data about the state of the grid and can detect fast transients. In this paper, we use data from micro-PMUs to engineer physics-based features for a novel anomaly detection algorithm that detects anomalies based on the transient properties of the power grid. This allows for a more capable, agile, and reliable anomaly scoring system that can learn normal behavior patterns and detect anomalous behavior efficiently. We show that by combining the classical data-based approaches with physics-based features in the anomaly detection algorithm, the machine learning algorithm proposed is capable of detecting different classes of anomalies (such as edge devices on-off attacks, single line-to-ground (SLG) faults, etc.). Simulation results on IEEE 34-node test feeder show that we can achieve better detection performance than traditional techniques for a broader class of anomalies. © 2018 IEEE.","","Electric fault currents; Feature extraction; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Phasor measurement units; Signal detection; Anomaly-detection algorithms; Detection performance; Distribution lines; Electrical monitoring; Single line to ground faults; Traditional techniques; Transient property; Transmission grids; Electric power transmission networks","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051443961"

This paper presents methods to detect a LOCA that is initiated: (i) while the plant is going through a small transient, and (ii) with a time-varying leak magnitude. The accident is simulated using a generic pressurized water reactor (GPWR) simulator. The fault is detected using a model-based approach with models identified using GPWR data. The model-based approach is multiple-model adaptive estimation (MMAE), which uses multiple system models representing both normal and faulted operating conditions. During operation, these models simulate the potential operating conditions, incorporating measurement feedback in a Kalman filter state-estimation structure. Faults are detected by selecting the model that most closely matches the system according to statistical characteristics. For a LOCA, data-driven models of the pressurizer liquid level are derived using first-principles and system identification. In system identification, a physics-based model form is derived that contains unknown parameters.

The unit is initially “trained” in a baseline phase based on data obtained from a simplified physics-based model of a railway vehicle suspension. Fault diagnosis is subsequently achieved in an inspection phase through a single, properly preselected, pair of vibration signals acquired from the vehicle, and a recently introduced data-based method, referred to as the functional model based method (FMBM), without resorting to the physics-based model of the baseline phase. The method’s cornerstone is the novel class of stochastic ARX-type models capable of accurately representing a system in a faulty state for its continuum of fault magnitudes. Fault diagnosis feasibility in a railway vehicle suspension is demonstrated via Monte Carlo simulations using different types and magnitudes of faults in the physics-based model and generating vibration signals corresponding to the healthy and faulty suspension. Two vibration signals are used by the diagnosis unit: the track velocity profile and the vehicle body acceleration above the trailing airspring. Fault diagnosis based on the FMBM is effective in a compact and unified statistical framework accounting for experimental and modelling uncertainty through appropriate interval estimates and hypothesis testing procedures. The unit is shown to exhibit high sensitivity and accurate estimation of even very small fault magnitudes, to detect and isolate unknown faults for which it has not been trained, and to be robust to high measurement noise, car body mass variations, and varying track irregularity. © 2015, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Data based method; Fault detection and isolation; Fault diagnosis; Functional model; Railway vehicle suspensions; Statistical time series method; Vibration based method","Automobile bodies; Automobile suspensions; Failure analysis; Locomotives; Monte Carlo methods; Railroads; Sensitivity analysis; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Suspensions (components); Uncertainty analysis; Vibrations (mechanical); Data based method; Fault detection and isolation; Functional model; Railway vehicle suspensions; Time series method; Vibration based method; Fault detection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84923224184"

Although existing deep learning approaches are able to intelligently detect and classify the faults in bearings, they still face one or both of the following challenges: 1) most of these approaches rely exclusively on data and do not incorporate physical knowledge into the learning and prediction processes and 2) the approaches often focus on the fault diagnosis of a single bearing in a rotating machine, while in reality, a rotating machine may contain multiple bearings. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel approach, namely physics-based convolutional neural network (PCNN), for fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings. In PCNN, an exclusively data-driven deep learning approach, called CNN, is carefully modified to incorporate useful information from physical knowledge about bearings and their fault characteristics. To this end, the proposed approach 1) utilizes spectral kurtosis and envelope analysis to extract sidebands from raw sensor signals and minimize non-transient components of the signals and 2) feeds the information about the fault characteristics into the CNN model. With the capability to process signals from multiple sensors, the proposed PCNN approach is capable of concurrently monitoring multiple bearings and detecting faults in these bearings. The performance of PCNN in machinery fault diagnosis is compared with that of traditional machine learning-and deep learning-based approaches reported in the literature. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","condition-based maintenance; Deep learning; fault detection; rolling element bearing; rotating machinery","Condition monitoring; Convolution; Deep learning; Failure analysis; Neural networks; Roller bearings; Rotating machinery; Condition based maintenance; Convolutional neural network; Fault characteristics; Learning-based approach; Machinery fault diagnosis; Prediction process; Rolling Element Bearing; Transient components; Fault detection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065390862"

Accurate small leak detection in the EVAP system is a challenging problem because of limited measurement capabilities, a wide range of operating conditions, and limited computing power on board the vehicle.

Although necessary to ensure evaluation reliability, EM analysis incurs considerable computational expenses. Due to structural complexity and large electrical size of arrays, individual simulations may be time consuming, whereas repetitive simulations performed as parts of design procedures are often unmanageable. In this context, simulationdriven design of antenna arrays is a challenging endeavor. Due to lack of proper algorithmic tools it is typically addressed in a simplistic manner, e.g., rudimentary decomposition or parameter sweeping, which hinders accounting for performance-degradation effects, thus leading to suboptimal results. Accelerated and automated design can be realized using surrogate-assisted techniques. This book is focused on demonstrating how surrogate models, both data-driven and physics-based, can be exploited to expedite antenna arrays design procedures such as parametric optimization, statistical analysis, or fault detection. The presented algorithms are illustrated using a large variety of examples or real-world printed-circuit antenna and antenna array structures. In many cases, numerical results are supported by experimental validation of fabricated prototypes. Furthermore, the book contains introductory material concerning numerical optimization, both conventional (gradient-based and derivative-free, including metaheuristics) and surrogate-based, as well as a considerable selection of customized procedures developed specifically to handle antenna array problems.

Wind turbines constitute a complex system that includes sub-systems from different physical domains such as electrical, mechanical, and hydraulic systems. They constitute hybrid dynamical systems comprising discrete parts due to presence of power electronic switches and continuous parts such as induction machines, pitch actuator and mechanical drive-train. In this paper, a multi-physics graphical model-based fault detection and isolation (FDI) method is developed for doubly fed induction generator-based wind turbines. The model of the wind turbine is developed using hybrid bond-graph theory that captures causal, temporal, and structural properties of the system. Causality inversion method is then employed to derive analytical redundancy relations (ARRs) based on the developed model. The FDI is performed based on the changes in the values of ARRs. A systematic approach based on Chi-square criterion is developed to determine the values of thresholds, based on which the change in ARRs due to occurrence of faults are detected.

Many research works have focused on CM and FD for different components of wind turbine. Gear is typically used in a wind turbine. There is insufficient space to locate the sensors for long-term monitoring of fatigue state of gear, thus, offline inspection using NDT in both manufacturing and maintenance processes are critically important. This paper proposes an inductive thermography method for gear inspection. The ability to track the properties variation in gear such as electrical conductivity, magnetic permeability, and thermal conductivity has promising potential for the evaluation of material state undertaken by contact fatigue. Conventional thermography characterization methods are built based on single physical field analysis such as heat conduction or in-plane eddy current field. This study develops a physics-based multidimensional spatial-transient-stage tensor model to describe the thermo optical flow pattern for evaluating the contact fatigue damage. A helical gear with different cycles of contact fatigue tests was investigated and the proposed method was verified.

When the top drive fails, drilling halts and operations are suspended until the machine is fixed, at considerable cost to all parties. Literature and survey data reveal that top drive failure is among the leading causes of hardware-related non-productive time (NPT) on drilling rigs. The objective therefore is to detect a failing top drive hours or even days before it can no longer function effectively, and pro-actively maintain it before catastrophic failure takes places. In this paper, three separate health monitoring techniques are considered for a top drive: thermal analysis, vibration analysis, and oil analysis. Appropriate sensors are suggested for each of the three analyses, and are described in this paper. The paper also details a thermal model and a fault detection algorithm used to monitor the lubrication and electric motor subsystems of an AC electric top drive. These algorithms have been implemented and deployed in the field. Since no faults have occurred to date in the top drives on which these algorithms have been deployed, simulation results are presented for artificially induced faults. The advantages and disadvantages of other relevant sensor technologies and methodologies are studied and discussed. It is shown that the upfront cost of the sensors and the data acquisition system can easily be recouped by preventing one to two top drive failures. Additionally, the thermal analysis method described can be conducted with the existing sensor suite available on most top drives. This novel methodology can be easily implemented without the need for complex sensors, and is expected to make a meaningful, positive contribution to lowering NPT associated with rig hardware failures.

If fault precursors are not detected in advance, they may lead to hard failures such as open and short circuits that could ultimately result in fire or loss of flight critical systems. Therefore, It is crucial to detect, locate, and characterize fault precursors for timely preventive maintenance and mitigation before hard failures occur. In this paper, a physics-based connector model consisting of multiple coaxial line sections with different characteristic impedances and lengths is proposed. Method of Moments (MoM) analyses were performed using commercial electromagnetic simulation software, FEKO, for transverse electric and magnetic (TEM) wave propagation through a connector. The physical parameters of the connector were optimized to match the measured S parameters for multiple insertion depths. The proposed models represent the connector for multiple insertion depths by varying only two length parameters at a time while other parameters are fixed. Insertion depth-dependent resonant frequency shifts observed during measurement are also captured by the model over the full range of fully inserted to barely touching contacts. Hence, the models provide accurate representations of the connector and properly detect precursors to partial insertion faults. ©2016. American Geophysical Union.

In this paper, we present a pointwise detection model with two phases: one involving the prediction of the next expected value in the time series for each data point, and another determining a range (i.e., normal value interval) surrounding the predicted next-step value. We show that dataset correlation can be used to detect corruptions indirectly and limit the size of the data set to monitor, taking advantage of the underlying physics of the simulation. Our results show that, using our techniques, we can detect a large number of corruptions (i.e., above 90% in some cases) with 84% memory overhead, and 13.75% extra computation time. © 2015 ACM.","Fault tolerance; High-performance computing; Resilience; Silent data corruption; Soft errors; Time series","Distributed computer systems; Errors; Fault tolerance; Iterative methods; Radiation hardening; Supercomputers; Time series; Application level; Detection models; Extra computations; High performance computing; Memory overheads; Resilience; Silent data corruptions; Soft error; Crime","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84987719472"

FDM systems can provide data pertaining to many types of accidents where human factors have been implicated because they track the manner in which the vehicles are operated. For helicopters, most implementations of such systems on helicopters rely on experts to determine pre-set limits on combinations of flight parameters. These limits are also known as ""safety events"". A common practical problem that arises in FDM systems is the need to have sufficient knowledge of a condition before events can be defined and used in a proactive manner. There has been recent interest in using alternative approaches to detecting faults and unsafe events in aviation and solve this inherent limitation of FDM. In this work, a model-based approach is investigated for potential improvements to FDM practices through an objective analysis of the conditions that pertain to an accident. First, a rollover during taxi is investigated using a lateral dynamic model. Various scenarios are passed to the model and analyzed to identify the combinations of conditions that lead to a rollover. The result is a map between the input space and the outcome generated by the model, which can be used by analysts to define boundaries of safe operation. The second model is based on helicopter performance theory and is used with autorotation data.

However, existing failure precursors are limited with respect to in situ monitoring. In this paper, the duration of the Miller plateau during the IGBT turn-on transition is proposed as an online precursor indicating two dominant types of failures. Based on the theoretical closed-form expressions, the adverse effects of package-related bond wire fatigue and chip-related gate oxide degradation on the Miller plateau duration are explained. By using a dedicated online measurement system that is implemented on the gate driver side, the proposed precursor is extracted during operation. Discrete IGBTs of two gate structures are employed during the accelerated aging tests. Negative and positive degradation trends of the Miller plateau duration under power cycling and high electric field stress, respectively, are revealed, thus illustrating the validity of the proposed method. Finally, the main differences in physics-of-failure between two types of aged devices are investigated using post-failure analysis. The innovation of applying the Miller plateau duration as a failure precursor involves its ability to accomplish real-time field monitoring and its sensitivity to multiple failure mechanisms. © 2012 IEEE.","Aging precursor; failure analysis; fault diagnosis; semiconductor device reliability; time measurement","Capacitance; Degradation; Electric fields; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBT); Logic gates; Outages; Reliability analysis; Testing; Threshold voltage; Time measurement; Transistors; Wire; Accelerated aging test; Closed-form expression; Gate oxide degradation; High electric field stress; Multiple failure mechanisms; On line measurement system; Online condition monitoring; Semiconductor device reliability; Condition monitoring","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044713727"

Automatic and rapid detection of coarse-scale compartments with distinct static and dynamic properties is an integral part of such high-level reservoir analysis. In this work, we present a hybrid framework specific to reservoir analysis for an automatic detection of clusters in space using spatial and temporal field data, coupled with a physics-based multiscale modeling approach. A novel and rigorous non-local formulation for flow in porous media is presented, in which the reservoir is represented by an adjacency matrix describing the connectivities of comprising compartments. We automatically divide the reservoir into a number of distinct compartments, in which the direction-dependent multiphase flow communication is a function of non-local phase potential differences. Our proposed clustering framework begins with a mixed-type raw dataset which can be categorical/numerical, spatial/ temporal, and discrete/continuous. The dataset can contain noisy/missing values of different data types including but not limited to well production/injection history, well location, well type, geological features, PVT measurements, perforation data, etc. Unsupervised clustering techniques suited to the input data types (e.g. k-prototypes, spectral, Gaussian Mixtures, and hierarchical clustering), and appropriate distance measures (such as Euclidean distance, soft dynamic time warping, and mode) are used. The input data is standardized, and upon convergence check, the best clustering representation is obtained. Finally, Support-Vector-Machine technique is utilized in the kernel space to trace a demarcating hyperplane for the clusters. The proposed framework is successfully applied to more than five mature fields in the Middle East, South and North America, each with more than a thousand wells. In a specific case study reported here, the proposed workflow is applied to a major field with a couple of hundreds of wells with more than 40 years of production history. Leveraging the fast forward model, an efficient ensemble-based history matching framework is applied to reduce the uncertainty of the global reservoir parameters such as inter-blocks and aquifer-reservoir communications, fault transmissibilities, and block-based oil in place. The ensemble of history matched models are then used to provide a probabilistic forecast for different field development scenarios. In addition, the clustering framework enables us to treat missing data and use the augmented dataset for improving the clustering accuracy. In summary, in this work a novel hybrid approach is presented in which we couple a physics-based non-local modeling framework with data-driven clustering techniques to provide a fast and accurate multiscale modeling of compartmentalized reservoirs. This research also adds to the literature by presenting a comprehensive work on spatio-temporal clustering for reservoir studies applications that well considers the clustering complexities, the intrinsic sparse and noisy nature of the data, and the interpretability of the outcome. © 2019, Society of Petroleum Engineers","","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066326394"

The major cost on wind turbine repairs is due to gearbox failure. Therefore, developing effective gearbox fault detection tools is important in the PHM of wind turbine. PHM system allows less costly maintenance because it can inform operators of needed repairs before a fault causes collateral damage happens to the gearbox. In this paper, a new acoustic emission (AE) sensor based gear fault detection approach is presented. This approach combines a heterodyne based frequency reduction technique with time synchronous average (TSA) and spectral kurtosis (SK) to process AE sensor signals and extract features as condition indictors for gear fault detection. Heterodyne techniques commonly used in communication are used to preprocess the AE signals before sampling. By heterodyning, the AE signal frequency is down shifted from MHz to below 50 kHz. This reduced AE signal sampling rate is comparable to that of vibration signals. The presented approach is validated using seeded gear tooth crack fault tests on a notational split torque gearbox. The approach presented in this paper is physics based and the validation results have showed that it could effectively detect the gear faults.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84892411750"

Options for new condition monitoring methods include off-board thermal imaging and camera-based optical methods for detecting abnormal deformation and surface features, as well as on-board sensors to detect tire faults during vehicle operation. Physics-based modeling of tire dynamics can provide a good understanding of the tire behavior, and give insight into observability requirements for improved monitoring systems. This paper describes a model to simulate the dynamics of haul truck tires when a fault is present to determine the effects of physical parameter changes that relate to faults. To simulate the dynamics, a lumped mass 'quarter-vehicle' model has been used to determine the response of the system to a road profile when a failure changes the original properties of the tire. The result is a model of tire vertical displacement that can be used to detect a fault, which will be tested under field conditions in time-varying conditions.","","Condition monitoring; Dynamics; Fault detection; Infrared imaging; Mine trucks; Mining; Monitoring; Off road vehicles; Roads and streets; Rolling resistance; Safety engineering; Trucks; Functional failure; Operating condition; Physical inspection; Physical parameters; Physics-based modeling; Time varying conditions; Vehicle operations; Vertical displacements; Tires","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84862326328"

This effort employed an existing, NASA developed, aircraft engine model. A critical engine actuator within the model was replaced by a dynamic, physics based EMA model that includes: controller, motor, drivetrain and feedback sensor sub-models. The actuator model includes simulation of the electrical, mechanical and thermal response of the system. The resulting platform was used to simulate a range of critical actuator fault conditions including: feedback resolver fault, ball-screw degradation, motor winding short, and LVDT non-linearity. Since the available experimental data from propulsion system EMAs is very limited, this platform provides an ideal opportunity to evaluate and enhance prognostic capability for critical engine applications. The model fault tests were used to demonstrate a prototype prognostics and health management (PHM) system for engine EMAs. First, the system response was used to develop an appropriate mode detection algorithm to identify the ideal system conditions for collection of diagnostic evidence. Then, using the acquired transient and steady-state system response, diagnostic data features were derived from EMA related sensors and engine performance parameters. Using these features as a starting point, a system level reasoner was created using multiple classification techniques including LDA, QDA and SVM. Using model generated data with simulated system variance, it was demonstrated that the reasoner provides excellent fault detection, isolation and severity assessment capability for all considered fault modes. Finally, a suitable actuator life model was developed and a probabilistic prognostic approach was used to determine the remaining useful life of the system. The demonstrated PHM system will significantly enhance the ability to safely operate aircraft, schedule maintenance activities, optimize operational life cycles, and reduce support costs.

One way to reduce these costs would be to implement a structural health and prognostic management (SHPM) system as part of a condition based maintenance paradigm with smart load management. To facilitate the development of such a system a multiscale modeling approach has been developed to identify how the underlying physics of the system are affected by the presence of damage and faults, and how these changes manifest themselves in the operational response of a full turbine. This methodology was used to investigate the effects of rotor imbalance and shear web disbond on a 5-MW offshore wind turbine in the present report. Based on simulations of the model, the operational measurements that demonstrated the highest sensitivity to the damage/faults were the blade tip accelerations and local pitching moments for both imbalance and shear web disbond. Detection strategies have been developed for these fault mechanisms with the intent of being integrated into an operations and maintenance paradigm. The integration of the health monitoring information provides the initial steps to reducing operations and maintenance costs for an offshore wind farm while increasing turbine availability and overall profit. © 2012 AIAA.","","Computer simulation; Fault detection; Maintenance; Offshore structures; Offshore wind farms; Offshore wind turbines; Structural dynamics; Condition based maintenance; Fault mechanism; Health monitoring; Multi-scale Modeling; Operations and maintenance; Pitching moments; Structural health; Wind turbine blades; Shear flow","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84881361078"

It only requires computing the dot product of two vectors. The first vector is a discrete signal of the last cycle wave and the second vector is a high-pass filter which reduces the fundamental component of the analyzed signal to zero and only measures deviations of this signal with respect to perfect sinusoidal waves.

Varying mass loading or constraint effects between partial measurements may determine several errors on the final conclusions. Frequency shifts can lead to erroneous interpretations of the dynamics parameters. Typically these errors remain limited to a few percent. Inconsistent data sets however can result in major processing errors, with all related consequences towards applications based on the consistency assumption, such as global modal parameter identification, model-based damage detection and FRF-based matrix inversion in substructuring, load identification and transfer path analysis [1]. This paper addresses the subject of accuracy in the context of the measurement of the dynamic properties of a particular lightweight structure. It presents a comprehensive comparative study between the use of accelerometer, laser vibrometer (scanning LDV) and PU-probe (acoustic particle velocity and pressure) measurements to measure the structural responses, with as final aim the comparison of modal model quality assessment.

The model provided statistically adequate fits to all the monitored macroscopic biological, chemical and physical data of the process, except the phosphate uptake dynamics. This phosphate discrepancy is hypothesized to result from the internal storage of phosphate as polyphosphate prior to the exponential growth phase. The antibiotic production was associated with the stationary phase and its kinetics was adequately described using a modified Luedeking-Piret equation. Further, the maintenance was best described by employing a combination of Pirt and Herbert models, a result that was supported by a model-based hypothesis testing. Overall the process knowledge currently incorporated in the model is believed to be useful both for process optimization purposes and for further testing of hypotheses aiming at improving the mechanistic understanding of antibiotic production with S. coelicolor.

However, this design success is subject to manufacturing highly reliable rotating components that typically undergo high rotational loading conditions that subject them to various types of failure initiation mechanisms. To counter such design concerns; health monitoring of these components is becoming a necessity, yet, this attribute remains somewhat challenging to implement. This is mostly due to the fact that presence of scattered loading conditions, crack sizes, component geometry and material property hinders the simplicity of imposing such applications. Therefore, exploitation of suitable techniques to monitor the health of these rotating components is ongoing and investigating other means of inspections such as non-destructive approaches to pre-detect hidden flaws and mini cracks is also being considered. These approaches or techniques extend more to assess materials' discontinuities and other defects that have matured to the level where a failure is likely. This paper is pertained to presenting data collected from a spin experiment of a turbine like rotor disk tested at a range of rotational speeds up to 12000 rpm. It further includes an analytical modeling of the rotor vibration response that is characterized by a combination of numerical and experimental data. The data include blade tip clearance, tip timing measurements and shaft displacements. The tests are conducted at the NASA Glenn Research Center's Rotordynamics Laboratory, a high precision spin rig.

Spectrum entropy clustering (SEC) is a data mining method of statistics, extracting useful characteristics from a mass of nonlinear and non-stationary data. Following a discussion on the characteristics of HOC theory and SEC method in this paper, the study of signal processing techniques and the unique merits of nonlinear coupling characteristic analysis in processing random and non-stationary signals are introduced. Also, a new clustering analysis and diagnosis method is proposed for detecting multi-damage on gear by introducing the combination of HOC and SEC into the damage-detection and diagnosis of the gear system. The noise is restrained by HOC and by extracting coupling features and separating the characteristic signal at different speeds and frequency bands. Under such circumstances, the weak signal characteristics in the system are emphasized and the characteristic of multi-fault is extracted. Adopting a data-mining method of SEC conducts an analysis and diagnosis at various running states, such as the speed of 300 r/min, 900 r/min, 1200 r/min, and 1500 r/min of the following six signals: no-fault, short crack-fault in tooth root, long crack-fault in tooth root, short crack-fault in pitch circle, long crack-fault in pitch circle, and wear-fault on tooth. Research shows that this combined method of detection and diagnosis can also identify the degree of damage of some faults. On this basis, the virtual instrument of the gear system which detects damage and diagnoses faults is developed by combining with advantages of MATLAB and VC++, employing component object module technology, adopting mixed programming methods, and calling the program transformed from an *.m file under VC++. This software system possesses functions of collecting and introducing vibration signals of gear, analyzing and processing signals, extracting features, visualizing graphics, detecting and diagnosing faults, detecting and monitoring, etc. Finally, the results of testing and verifying show that the developed system can effectively be used to detect and diagnose faults in an actual operating gear transmission system. © 2013 American Institute of Physics.","","Automobile engines; Cracks; Damage detection; Data mining; Entropy; Frequency bands; Gears; MATLAB; Plastic deformation; Program diagnostics; Signal detection; Characteristic signal; Detection and diagnosis; Gear transmission system; Higher order cumulants; Higher order cumulants (HOC); Nonlinear coupling characteristic; Nonstationary signals; Signal processing technique; Fault detection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84874885588"

A detection system may also reduce maintenance costs by increasing the time between inspections and reducing the number of spares required. Currently, the only method to monitor engine rotor degradation is through periodic removal of the engine from service, disassembly, and inspection of each rotor. The objective of this study was to propagate a crack in a cyclic engine test and evaluate the ability of an eddy current sensor and Reasoner software system to isolate a crack and predict its remaining useful life. The engine used for these tests was a Spey RB168 Mk 101 engine with titanium blades. Prior to the engine test, low cycle fatigue (LCF) spin-pit testing was carried out on a pre-flawed disk to validate understanding of the disk crack growth and reduce the risk of fracture during engine testing. Time of arrival data was collected using the QinetiQ eddy current sensor based tip timing system, to investigate the blade movement caused by crack growth in the disk. A greater understanding of the different types of faults that might exist in a rotor assembly and the ability to differentiate between them using the tip timing system is essential if the true nature of a fault is to be diagnosed and reported. A software Reasoner, using physics-based structural transfer functions to relate blade tip timing measurements to the damage state of the disk, was validated during the spin-pit test and was subsequently used on the cracked disk test at MoD Shoeburyness. The Reasoner provided real-time monitoring of the crack growth and remaining useful life of the component.

Electrolytic capacitors and MOSFET's have higher failure rates than other components in DC-DC converter systems. For example, in avionics systems where the power supply drives a GPS unit, ripple currents can cause glitches in the GPS position and velocity output, and this may cause errors in the navigation solution causing the aircraft to fly off course. A model based approach to studying degradation phenomena enables us to combine the energy based modeling of the DC-DC converter with physics of failure models of capacitor degradation, and predict using stochastic simulation methods how system performance deteriorates with time. We have employed a topological energy based modeling scheme based on the bond graph (BG) modeling language for building parametric models of multi-domain physical systems. Our current work adopts a physics of failure model (Arrhenius Law) for equivalent series resistance (ESR) increase in electrolytic capacitors subjected to electrical and thermal stresses. The derived degradation model of the capacitor is reintroduced into the DC-DC converter system model to study changes in the system performance using Monte Carlo simulation methods.","Bond graphs; DC-DC converters; Electrolytic capacitors; ESR; Fault detection; Fault isolation; GPS; Prognosis","Air navigation; Avionics; DC-DC converters; Electric power systems; Electric resistance; Electrolytic capacitors; Fault detection; Graph theory; HVDC power transmission; Machinery; Models; Monte Carlo methods; Paramagnetic resonance; Stochastic models; Arrhenius law; Avionics systems; Bond graph; Converter system; DC-DC power converter; Degradation analysis; Degradation model; Energy-based models; Equivalent series resistance; Failure rate; Fault isolation; Fault simulation; Model based approach; Modeling languages; Monte Carlo simulation methods; MOS-FET; Multi-domain physical systems; Navigation solution; Parametric models; Physics of failures; Power supply; Prognosis; Ripple currents; Stochastic simulation methods; Global positioning system","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84871216785"

The purpose of this paper is to describe development of a new discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based approach for detection of winding interturn faults. Design/methodology/approach-The following approach was accomplished for development of the proposed fault detection method in this study. The DWT was first applied to decompose the terminal current signals of a transformer, which in turn were obtained from simulations using a finite elements method model of the transformer, into a series of wavelet components. Based on the characteristic features associated with interturn faults extracted from the decomposed waveforms of the terminal currents, a detection scheme was developed. An experimental setup was used to validate the proposed detection method. Findings-The results of this study demonstrate the efficacy of DWT applied on terminal currents of the transformer to identify interturn faults on the windings well before such faults lead to a catastrophic failure. It is believed that, based on the present findings, there definitely exists scope for improving interturn fault diagnosis with wavelet transform. Research limitations/ implications-Performing more detailed studies to find all relevant characteristics of the wavelet transform in this application, identifying the location of the faulted turns along winding, applying the method for indicating early stages of turn insulation deterioration and evaluating other type of wavelets for this application would be some future directions of this research. Practical implications-With the proposed method, it is becoming possible to detect early signs of the fault occurrence, so that the necessary corrective actions can be taken to prevent long-lasting outages and reduce down times of the faulty power transformer. The method will be particularly useful as a complement for the classical protection devices of the power transformers. Originality/value-Some recent studies have been carried out regarding the application of DWT for discrimination between an internal fault and other disturbances such as magnetizing inrush and external faults. This paper extends those studies for the detection of interturn faults using more quantitative and qualitative characteristics features. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Electrical faults; Transformers; Transforms; Wave physics; Windings","Computer simulation; Damage detection; Discrete wavelet transforms; Electric fault currents; Fault detection; Outages; Transformer protection; Transformer substations; Transformer windings; Winding; Catastrophic failures; Corrective actions; Design/methodology/approach; Detection methods; Detection scheme; Electrical faults; Experimental setup; External fault; Finite-elements method; Future directions; High-level fault; Insulation deterioration; Inter-turn fault; Internal faults; Long lasting; Magnetizing inrush; Protection device; Terminal currents; Transformers; Transforms; Wave forms; Wavelet components; Winding faults; Power transformers","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79952382480"

This system cleans graywater (waste water collected from sinks and showers) and recycles it into clean water. Like all engineered systems, the WRS is prone to standard degradation due to regular use, as well as other faults. Diagnostic and prognostic applications will be deployed on the WRS to ensure its safe, efficient, and correct operation. The diagnostic and prognostic results can be used to enable condition-based maintenance to avoid unplanned outages, and perhaps extend the useful life of the WRS. Diagnosis involves detecting when a fault occurs, isolating the root cause of the fault, and identifying the extent of damage. Prognosis involves predicting when the system will reach its end of life irrespective of whether an abnormal condition is present or not. In this paper, first, we develop a physics model of both nominal and faulty system behavior of the WRS. Then, we apply an integrated model-based diagnosis and prognosis framework to the simulation model of the WRS for several different fault scenarios to detect, isolate, and identify faults, and predict the end of life in each fault scenario, and present the experimental results. © 2013 IEEE.","","Computer simulation; Damage detection; Energy efficiency; Manned space flight; NASA; Office buildings; Space applications; Water recycling; Abnormal conditions; Ames research centers; Condition based maintenance; Engineered systems; Human spaceflights; Isolating the roots; Model based diagnosis; Water recycling system; Fault detection","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84878719300"

This paper summarizes a physics-based remaining useful life (RUL) prediction method developed in the DARPA Engine System Prognosis (ESP) program. This investigation focuses on a typical roller bearing fault (or defect) on the outer raceway. Spall detection is based on the fusion of vibration and online oil debris sensors. Spall size estimation is derived from the amount of bearing debris chips that passed through the Oil Debris Monitor sensor. Subscale propagation tests were performed to generate the response surface of the spall propagation rate under various operating speeds and loads. A particle filter based approach was used to track the spall propagation rate and update the prediction according to newly calculated diagnostics information. The bearing spall propagation model outputs a RUL distribution, which is calculated based on future operating conditions and the time the spall size crossing the failure threshold. The developed RUL prediction method was validated using fullscale bearing spall tests. The comparison of model prediction and measured ground truth demonstrated that the developed model was able to predict the spall propagation rate accurately, and its prediction accuracy and confidence can be further improved by incorporating more diagnostics updates and/or increasing the confidence in the sensor data.","","Aircraft detection; Aircraft engines; Debris; Engines; Oil shale; Comparison of models; Diagnostics informations; Operating condition; Operational scenario; Prediction accuracy; Propagation modeling; Remaining useful life predictions; Roller bearing fault; Forecasting","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84920611947"

Lack of health monitoring data from fielded systems and prohibitive costs of carrying out real flight tests push for the need of building system models and designing affordable but realistic experimental setups. This paper presents our approach to accomplish a comprehensive test environment equipped with fault injection and data collection capabilities. Efforts also include development of multiple models for EMA operations, both in nominal and fault conditions that can be used along with measurement data to generate effective diagnostic and prognostic estimates. A detailed description has been provided about how various failure modes are inserted in the test environment and corresponding data is collected to verify the physics based models under these failure modes that have been developed in parallel. A design of experiment study has been included to outline the details of experimental data collection. Furthermore, some ideas about how experimental results can be extended to real flight environments through actual flight tests and using real flight data have been presented. Finally, the roadmap leading from this effort towards developing successful prognostic algorithms for electromechanical actuators is discussed.","","Actuators; Aerospace applications; Data acquisition; Design of experiments; Electromechanical devices; Fault detection; Knowledge based systems; Mechanical actuators; Monitoring; Building systems; Fault conditions; Fielded systems; Flight environment; Health monitoring; Measurement data; Physics-based models; Test Environment; Electromechanical actuators","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84920549981"

These consequential faults create alarms. Normally, alarms arrive out of time order, depending on system physics, alarm limit settings, current load situations, and clock skew, and it is hard for operators to analyze the developing fault situation, to understand what is really going on, and to take actions to alleviate the situation or perform an effective restoration of the grid in time. The effect is known as an alarm cascade. It is the most difficult alarm problem and also the most dangerous, since it appears in exactly those situations where the alarm system is needed the most. Methods based on multilevel flow models (MFM), use simple models of power flows to capture the causality of technical systems. Here, an algorithm based on MFM is presented. It offers a complete and efficient solution for root cause analysis. Both the algorithm and modeling concept have been industrially proven in other industrial branches, for example, conventional and nuclear power generation. MFM models of power grids can be generated automatically from topology databases. This means that a plug-and-play solution to the problem of alarm cascades in power grids is possible. The MFM-based algorithm can handle all possible combinations of faults, including multiple independent root faults and circular causations, in a theoretically correct and complete way. Thus, it makes no single fault assumption. In a sense, it is a final solution to fault causation analysis. The method can handle out-oforder events, and does not depend on timing information. It updates its analysis in real-time to follow the changing conditions on the grid, such as, for example, varying flow directions and breaker positions. The system has been tested in projects with the Swedish National Grid, EPRI, First Energy, Midwest ISO, and New York ISO. For example, it gives an immediate and correct analysis of the September 23, 2003 blackout in southern Sweden and eastern Denmark. Currently, a system is under delivery to the Swedish National Grid. It will be running on-line on real-time data from the summer of 2008.","Alarm cascade; Blackout; Multilevel flow modeling; Root cause analysis; Situational awareness.","Algorithms; Computer simulation; Electric power distribution; Blackout; Industrial branches; Multilevel flow modeling; Multilevel flow models; Plug-and-play solutions; Real-time detection; Root cause analysis; Situational awareness; Alarm systems","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84876759650"

In order to highlight the periodic phenomena, autocorrelation transform is employed to extract the periodic exponents and Fourier transform is used to map the time-domain information into frequency domain.

Subsystems that primarily exhibit state machine-like, modal behavior may be treated by qualitative finite-domain diagnostic reasoning or rule-based expert systems. Others elements are best represented by physicsbased models and characterized by continuous-domain dynamical relationships. Diagnostics for these components are often quantitative in nature, using detailed physical knowledge of underlying system dynamics to uncover and exploit analytical redundancy. In this paper, we describe the use of the NASA Ames-developed HyDE (Hybrid Diagnostics Engine) to integrate diagnostic recommendations from external smart monitors. These smart monitors provide accurate, targeted diagnostic recommendations, while HyDE maintains a belief state that is consistant with both the external diagnoses and its own hierarchical representation of system behavior.

The LNT is typically used as a storage device, capturing NOx during lean engine operation. The trap can be regenerated by controlling the exhaust air-fuel ratio to create a rich gas mixture. Under rich conditions, the stored NOx is released and catalytically converted. This way, tailpipe emissions can be significantly reduced by properly modulating the lean (storage) and rich (regeneration) periods. To maintain the LNT operate with high conversion efficiency, an optimized control of the regeneration scheduling is required. In addition, LNT systems require fault diagnostic schemes to detect and isolate faults, typically related to sulfur and thermal damages. This paper deals with the design and validation through simulation of a model-based fault diagnosis scheme for a LNT system. The mathematical model of the subsystem, based on the physics of the processes involved, consist of time-varying nonlinear ODEs. The proposed diagnostic approach is based on the generation of residuals using system models and through comparison of the predicted and measured value of selected variables, including the AFR, catalyst output temperature and the NOx concentration at the output of the LNT. The paper focuses on detection and isolation of controller faults and LNT parametric faults related to sulfur and thermal damage. The model utilized in the diagnostic scheme, which includes sulfur poisoning and thermal deactivation processes, has been experimentally validated from data collected on a Diesel LNT system and integrated with a quasi-steady engine and vehicle simulator to estimate tailpipe emissions during standard driving cycles.

Therefore, reliable monitoring for the detection, diagnosis and prediction of such faults are of great concerns to the wind industry. Monitoring of WT gearboxes has gained importance as WTs become larger and move to more inaccessible locations. This paper summarizes typical WT gearbox failure modes and reviews supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and condition monitoring system (CMS) approaches for monitoring them. It then presents two up-to-date monitoring case studies, from different manufacturers and types of WT, using SCADA and CMS signals.The first case study, applied to SCADA data, starts from basic laws of physics applied to the gearbox to derive robust relationships between temperature, efficiency, rotational speed and power output. The case study then applies an analysis, based on these simple principles, to working WTs using SCADA oil temperature rises to predict gearbox failure.The second case study focuses on CMS data and derives diagnostic information from gearbox vibration amplitudes and oil debris particle counts against energy production from working WTs.The results from the two case studies show how detection, diagnosis and prediction of incipient gearbox failures can be carried out using SCADA and CMS signals for monitoring although each technique has its particular strengths. It is proposed that in the future, the wind industry should consider integrating WT SCADA and CMS data to detect, diagnose and predict gearbox failures.Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The main challenges for such system are: to cope with CASTOR's log format diversity and its information scattered among several log files, the need for long term information archival, the strict reliability requirements and the group based GUI visualization. For this purpose, we have designed, developed and deployed a centralized system consisting of four independent layers: the Log Transfer layer for collecting log lines from all tape servers to a single aggregation server, the Data Mining layer for combining log data into transaction context, the Storage layer for archiving the resulting transactions and finally the Web UI layer for accessing the information. Having flexibility, extensibility and maintainability in mind, each layer is designed to work as a message broker for the next layer, providing a clean and generic interface while ensuring consistency, redundancy and ultimately fault tolerance. This system unifies information previously dispersed over several monitoring tools into a single user interface, using Splunk, which also allows us to provide information visualization based on access control lists (ACL). Since its deployment, it has been successfully used by CASTOR tape operators for quick overview of transactions, performance evaluation, malfunction detection and from managers for report generation.","","Access control; Digital storage; Fault tolerance; High energy physics; Information systems; Managers; Program debugging; Storage management; User interfaces; Visualization; Access control lists; Centralized systems; Generic interfaces; Information visualization; Infrastructure monitoring; Monitoring system; Reliability requirements; Report generation; Data mining","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84903444811"

This study has developed an innovative anomaly detection strategy for bearing fault detection based on multi-sensing variables and a series of statistical data-driven approaches. The major advantage of using multi-sensors is that it enables the capture of abnormal signals due to different contact physics, for example phase transformation or surface cracking that may not be detected by one type of sensor. Experiments have been carried out on a bench top bearing test-rig under both normal and seeded defect conditions. Sensors measuring electrostatic charge, vibration and debris are used in this study. The signals under normal bearing conditions are used to train Gaussian mixture models (GMM) to establish a preliminary normal model for anomaly detection. The preliminary model is firstly adapted by a novel 'data cleaning' method that identifies and removes unexpected anomalies in the training data. The purpose of data adaptation is to eliminate fault masking by the anomalies during training. Seeded defect bearing tests provide signals containing data from a bearing under 'faulty' or failure conditions. Hotelling's T-squared statistics of the test data are used to detect anomalies in this study. The results from a series of bearing tests have demonstrated that the application of the GMM adaptation techniques based entropy score and distance can help to optimise the trend of the T-squared statistic, minimise noise and extract/ enhance valuable abnormal trends. Furthermore, to achieve automatic detection with the T-squared statistic, a novel threshold set-up approach based on the combination of the GMM and extreme value theory (EVT) has been developed in this study. The threshold set by the new approach can reduce the false alarm rate by 20% compared to the thresholds set by other conventional thresholds. Details of the developed approaches as well as a comparison with some conventional approaches are presented in this paper.","","Bearings (structural); Debris; Electrostatics; Fault detection; Fault tolerant computer systems; Roller bearings; Sensors; Statistics; Surface defects; Anomaly detection; Automatic Detection; Bearing conditions; Bearing fault detection; Bearing tests; Conventional approach; Data adaptation; Data cleaning; Electrostatic charges; Extreme value theory; Failure conditions; False alarm rate; Fault masking; Gaussian Mixture Model; GMM adaptations; Hotelling's T; Multi sensor; New approaches; Normal model; Phase transformation; Preliminary model; Seeded defects; Sensing techniques; Statistical datas; Surface cracking; Tapered roller bearing; Test data; Training data; Univariate; Signal detection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77956934897"

This is necessary to enable intelligent agents to manipulate their own knowledge autonomously and thus reason and communicate effectively in open, dynamic digital environments characterised by the heterogeneity of data and of representation languages. Our approach is based on patterns of diagnosis of faults detected across multiple ontologies. Such patterns allow to identify the type of repair required when conflicting ontologies yield erroneous inferences. We assume that each ontology is locally consistent, i.e. inconsistency arises only across ontologies when they are merged together. Local consistency avoids the derivation of uninteresting theorems, so the formula for diagnosis can essentially be seen as an open theorem over the ontologies. The system's application domain is physics; we have adopted a modular formalisation of physics, structured by means of locales in Isabelle, to perform modular higher-order reasoning, and visualised by means of development graphs.","Automated ontology evolution; Development graphs; GALILEO; Higher-order logic; Isabelle/hol; Ontology; Ontology conflict detection; Ontology repair plans","Artificial intelligence; Automata theory; Automation; Intelligent agents; Knowledge representation; Repair; Development graphs; GALILEO; Higher order logic; Isabelle/HOl; Ontology evolution; Ontology","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-78651453271"

This paper proposes a novel physics-based strategy to detect and isolate an exhaust manifold leakage and a closed-stuck wastegate fault. The strategy is based on a globally optimal parameter estimation algorithm which detects an effective hole area in the exhaust manifold. The estimation algorithm requires prediction of the exhaust manifold's input and output flows. The input flow is predicted by a nonlinear Luenberger observer which is analytically shown to be robust to the faults in the exhaust manifold. The output flow of the exhaust manifold is detected by a sliding mode observer. The designed fault diagnosis and isolation (FDI) strategy is tested with the experimental data collected from a 1.7-liter turbocharged SI engine. The validation results show that the FDI strategy can detect a leakage fault from a 5mm hole in the exhaust manifold, and can identify the wastegate stuck faults.

The original health monitoring problem can be therefore formulated as a model detection problem. Besides the introduction of the theoretical preliminary of multi-model based approach, the computer-aided design process, right-sized modelling and realtime simulation based validation for residual generator with Dymola and Matlab are also discussed.

In this paper, a frequency reduction technique is proposed to preprocess the AE signals. Heterodyne technique commonly used in communication is first employed to preprocess the AE signals before sampling. By heterodyning, the AE signal frequency is down shifted from several hundred kHz to below 50 kHz. This reduced AE signal sampling rate is comparable to that of vibration signals. After preprocessing, time synchronous average (TSA) is calculated and spectrum kurtosis (SK) is estimated for the calculated TSA signals as AE features for gear fault detection. An optimal band pass filter based on SK is designed to filter the signals and to extract features for fault detection. The presented method is validated using seeded gear fault tests on a notational split torque gearbox. The method presented in this paper is physics based and the validation results have showed that it could effectively detect the gear faults.","Acoustic emission; Diagnosis; Gear fault; Kurtogram; Spectrum kurtosis; T-statistics; Time synchronous average","Acoustic emissions; Diagnosis; Electric fault currents; Emission spectroscopy; Heterodyning; Higher order statistics; Machinery; Sensors; Signal sampling; Gear faults; Kurtogram; Spectrum kurtosis; T-statistics; Time synchronous average; Fault detection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84884378031"

However, an inherent difficulty for a data-driven tool is that the quality of detection may drastically suffer in the event of sensor degradation. This paper proposes an anomaly detection algorithm for condition monitoring of nuclear power plants, where symbolic feature extraction and the associated pattern classification are optimized by appropriate partitioning of (possibly noise-contaminated) sensor time series. In this process, the system anomaly signatures are identified by masking the sensor degradation signatures. The proposed anomaly detection methodology is validated on the International Reactor Innovative & Secure (IRIS) simulator of nuclear power plants, and its performance is evaluated by comparison with that of principal component analysis (PCA). © 2011 IEEE.","Data-driven fault detection; feature extraction; pattern classification; symbolic dynamics; time series analysis","Condition monitoring; Degradation; Dynamical systems; Fault detection; Feature extraction; Nuclear energy; Nuclear power plants; Principal component analysis; Sensors; Time series; Pattern recognition; Time series analysis; Anomaly detection; Anomaly-detection algorithms; Data-driven; Data-driven fault detection; Pattern classification; Pattern identification; Physics-based models; Real-time data; Sensor degradation; Symbolic Dynamic Filtering; Symbolic Dynamics; Time series analysis; Sensors","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79951682530"

With silicon technology scaling, integrated circuits are implemented with smaller transistors, operate at higher clock frequency, and run at lower voltage levels. As a result, they are subject to more faults, in particular, transient faults. Additionally, in nano-scale technology, physics-based random variations play an important role in many device performance metrics, and have led to many new defects. We are therefore facing the challenge of how to build reliable and predictable embedded systems for safety-critical applications with unreliable components. This paper describes several key challenges and presents several emerging solutions to the design and optimization of such systems. In particular, it discusses the advantages of using time-redundancy based fault-tolerance techniques that are triggered by fault occurrences to handle transient faults and the hardware/software trade-offs related to fault detection and fault tolerance.

Due to its pipelined structure and multirate processing requirements, a single numerical error in one stage can easily affect multiple outputs in final result. In this paper, we propose a weighted checksum code based fault tolerance technique for 2-D discrete wavelet transform. The technique encodes the input array at the 2-D discrete wavelet transform algorithm level, and algorithms are designed to operate on encoded data and produce encoded output data. The proposed encoding technique can perfectly fit into the lifting structure and existing general purpose 2-D discrete wavelet lifting VLSI architectures, without significant modification and overhead.

The bond graph model defines the causality of the system and allows for automated generation of a temporal causal graph (TCG). From the TCG, the fault signatures of the model at a given time are determined. Fault signatures indicate how the residuals of the system responses and their derivatives respond to a particular parameter changing. During online fault detection, an extended Kalman filter combines measurement data with the system model to predict responses for a health system. A real-time statistical on the residuals of the system responses determines when the measurement data deviates significantly from the predicted system behavior. The signs of the 0ththrough 2ndderivatives of all the residuals are recorded. The fault signatures are compared with the signs of the residuals to isolate the faulty system parameter qualitatively, thus decreasing the computational demand of isolation, The fault is then quantified using a least squares approach. The proposed methodology includes models at multiple levels, from system to subsystem to component to material level physics of failure. The methodology is implemented for a multi-level system composed of a centrifugal pump and hydraulic actuator driving a load. Reliable fault identification is achieved, setting the foundation for prognosis and more complex multiple and intermittent fault scenarios.","","Fault detection; Graph theory; Graphic methods; Hierarchical systems; Hydraulic actuators; Online systems; Structural health monitoring; Automated generation; Computational demands; Fault identifications; Least-squares approach; Multi-level systems; On-line fault detection; Parameter changing; Physics of failures; Monitoring","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84945195172"

The modeling effort and simulation results provided the thorough knowledge needed to extract features from the system responses to detect the occurrence of faults. The nominal pump and the pump with a single piston replaced by three different machined pistons were tested to emulate varying stages of piston wear. The experiments demonstrated that the model was able to capture the dynamic behavior of the actual system.

Once a LED chip bonded on a lead frame is illuminated, the photocurrent will flow through the loop circuits formed by the lead frame. Through characterization of the weak photovoltaic response in the lead frame with the 20 LED chips, five LED faults, including chip defects (chip quality and chip contamination) and bonding deficiencies (disconnection, debonding, and rebonding), can be detected before packaging. A high-sensitivity photocurrent detection instrument has been developed to detect different color (red, yellow, green, and blue) and different size LED chips (9-15 mil) on LED assembly line. A key feature of the new instrument is the capability to tune and implement the maximum output power (photocurrent) in the loop lead frame by designing the high-efficiency magnetic core, the magnetic coil and the detecting system. Experiments demonstrate that the photovoltaic behaviors for LED p-n junctions are directly related to the LED electroluminescent characteristics, and the internal optoelectronic characteristics and the external Ohmic contact performances can be derived by detecting the photocurrent of LED chips.

Reliable fault detection techniques are therefore in demand to reduce maintenance cost and prevent catastrophic failures. Although a number of approaches have been reported in the literature, it remains very challenging to develop a reliable technique to accurately estimate the health condition of a rotating bladed disc. Correspondingly, this paper presents a novel technique for bladed disc crack detection through two sequential signal processing stages: (1) signal preprocessing that aims to eliminate the noises in the blade passage signals; (2) signal postprocessing that intends to identify the crack location. In the first stage, physics-based modeling and interpretation are established to help characterize the noises. The crack initiation can be determined based on the calculated health monitoring index derived from the sinusoidal effects. In the second stage, the crack is located through advanced detrended fluctuation analysis of the preprocessed data. The proposed technique is validated using a set of spin rig test data (i.e. tip clearance and time of arrival) that was acquired during a test conducted on a bladed military engine fan disc. The test results have demonstrated that the developed technique is an effective approach for identifying and locating the incipient crack that occurs at the root of a bladed disc. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.","blade passage signal; bladed disc; fault detection; feature extraction; physical modeling; signal processing; turbo fan engine","Crack initiation; Cracks; Engines; Fault detection; Feature extraction; Signal processing; Time of arrival; Blade passage; Bladed discs; Catastrophic failures; Crack initiation and propagation; Detrended fluctuation analysis; Fault detection techniques; Physical model; Physics-based modeling; Crack detection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84870382042"

Cold engine testing becomes progressively the main End-of-Line test which is used nowadays from automotive engine manufacturers with the purpose of determining the integrity of engine assembly. The present work is focused on the development of a detailed physics-based, lumped-parameter, dynamic model of a single cylinder internal combustion engine coupled with an alternating current transient dynamometer for cold engine testing applications. The overall transient engine test cell model is described based on a two-inertia system model consisting of the engine, the dynamometer and the coupling shaft. The internal combustion engine is modelled based on First Law of Thermodynamics and Second Newton's Law for rotational bodies. The transient dynamometer is actually an alternating current three-phase induction motor which is modelled according to direct-quadrature axis approach, and its drive unit which is responsible for controlling the speed of the motor using indirect field orientation scheme. The engine and dynamometer are connected through a coupling shaft which is modelled as a compliant member with damping. The model is validated against experimental measurements such as engine cylinder pressure, engine excitation torque and alternating currents of the induction motor. All of the experimental measurements were recorded from an identical single cylinder transient engine test cell using a highly advanced instrumentation system. The described model serves as an ideal platform for developing innovative model-based fault detection and diagnosis techniques for cold engine testing applications. In conclusion, this is presented successfully for two simulated fault cases, a process fault and a sensor fault, proving the functionality and usefulness of the model.

Signals measured from the real machine are compared to simulations derived from physics-based models of the machine. To make simulations match measured signals, parameters of the models are adjusted or ""tuned"". A direct physical correspondence between the model's parameters and real system elements permits the tuned parameters to locate faults and simplifies classification of faults. The degree to which faults in a degraded machine alters power and signal flows through the machine, indicates machine health. An analogy is formed between a machine and a communications channel, to apply powerful theorems from communications theory to assess machine functional health. For prognosis of machine health and functionality, parameter variations observed over time can be extrapolated into the future, and simulations of the model with extrapolated parameter values can be performed, enabling model simulations to forecast future machine behavior. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) permits a machine operator to select specific sensor outputs, desired parameters, and specific faults to tailor the diagnostics system to a specific machine or design. The aforementioned model based diagnostics techniques are computed behind the interface. In this article, these techniques are applied to motors. Motor voltages, currents, and speeds are measured, and parameters including stator resistance, rotor resistance and magnetic field features are tuned to detect and isolate shorted turns and broken rotor bars. Then functional health of degraded motors is assessed.","Condition monitoring; Health assessment; Model-based diagnostics; Motors","Condition monitoring; Extrapolation; Graphical user interfaces; Health; Machinery; Motors; Signal detection; Broken rotor bar; Communications channels; Health assessments; Machine behavior; Machine faults; Machine health; Machine operators; Measured signals; Model simulation; Model-based diagnostics; Motor voltage; Parameter values; Physics-based models; Real systems; Rotor resistances; Shorted turns; Signal flow; Specific sensors; Stator resistance; Computer simulation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84871230761"

As one of the cleanest, the most realistic renewable energies with a good prospect of development and utilization in large scale, nanocrystalline solar energy has received extensive attention. The main purpose of our research is to locate the fault devices in nanocrystalline solar power system in an on-line way based on the real-time information. Fisher discriminant analysis is a widely used technique in pattern classification. The basic idea of Fisher discriminant analysis is to find the Fisher optimal discriminant vector such that the Fisher criterion function is maximized. Large numbers of simulation experiments have fully proven that fault detection of fault component (fault section) can be performed by Fisher discriminant analysis and calculation. And the results of Fisher fault detection are accurate and reliable.

The measured engine operating and performance parameters are used to train two neural network models, namely back propagation and generalized regression. Following the training and validation of the neural network model, simulation results for test data corresponding to various engine usage stages are found to be close by two models. The analysis identifies an anamoly in the simulated and measured data collected 17 months after the engine overhauling which may be attributed to deliberate adjustments in the operating parameters.

Taking into account the specificity of industrial processes diagnostics, the robust fault detection problem is presented in the first part of the chapter. Considering the robust neural model, the passive approach based on model error modeling is described. On the other hand, the active robust approach using the dynamic neural model is based on the bounded error approach. Knowing the model structure and possessing knowledge about parameters uncertainty, the adaptive threshold can be defined and the robust fault detection scheme is designed. Next, based on the diagnostic signal generated by detection algorithms, the fault isolation problem with the use of fuzzy logic is presented. Here reasoning algorithms for single and multiple faults described by the binary diagnostic matrix and rules are considered. Then, taking into account the complex structure of industrial plants, reasoning algorithms are extended on the hierarchical structure of the diagnostic system. Such a diagnostic system reflects the structure of the process and/or control system. The rest of the chapter outlines the so-called belief-network-based diagnostic model. This approach is an alternative to the well-known model-based one and is called symptom-based diagnostics. Such a model allows simultaneous representation of diagnostics knowledge acquired from passive as well as active experiments, diagnostic relations, and generic knowledge described by physics laws. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84890237081"

Complex trigger and data acquisition systems are built to select on-line the most interesting events and write them to persistent storage. The final stage of this selection process nowadays often happens on large computer clusters. The stable and reliable operation of such event filter clusters is critical for the success of these experiments. Operating the event filter cluster must ensure dead time free processing of large amount of data, requiring 24-h continuous status monitoring of each processing node, and fast detection and problem solving. Ideally, problems should be recognized before they deteriorate the system performance. The process control of the event filter cluster is performed exclusively by a human operator, placing high demands difficult to accomplish. In this paper, a hybrid system based on expert systems technology and statistical tools and methods is proposed to address this issue. The system is built upon a scalable modular architecture and a design overview is given. The proposed hybrid system is designed and tested in a real environment, with an event filter cluster prototype based on the architecture of the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at CERN. The system test results with an analysis are provided. Finally, the future possibilities are discussed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

A physics of failure model is employed in conjunction with a robust derivative of the Mahalanobis distance in order to ascertain current gearbox behaviour. The technique is normalised for external conditions, turbine loading and previous behaviour; allowing the technique to be readily applied by industry to various gearboxes. The model is shown to accurately encapsulate current behavioural conditions. Following this, prediction of future gearbox condition is performed through the use of artificial neural networks. An effective prognostic horizon of up to 14 days is found whilst employing suspended data, with prediction certainty increasing as the horizon is reduced. This allows for the effective scheduling of offshore maintenance actions to ensure high availability whilst simultaneously reducing maintenance costs.","Ann; Fault detection; Fault prognosis; Robust technique; Scada; Wind turbine","Data encapsulation; Fault detection; Forecasting; Maintenance; Multivariant analysis; Neural networks; Scheduling; Wind power; Wind turbines; Ann; Fault prognosis; Multivariate statistical techniques; Multivariate statistics; Physics of failure models; Robust technique; Scada; Wind turbine gearboxes; Loading","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84925583079"

Detecting and isolating faults may be convenient for some applications where the fault does not have severe consequences on humans as well as on the environment. However, in some situations, detecting and diagnosing faults may not be sufficient. In these cases, it is more interesting to anticipate the time of the fault, what is the purpose of prognostics. This latter activity aims at estimating the remaining useful life of systems by using three main approaches: data-driven prognostics, model-based prognostics and hybrid prognostics. Data-driven prognostics concerns the transformation of the raw monitoring data to relevant models or trends which are then used to continuously assess the health state of the system and predict its remaining useful life. This approach is easy to implement, but suffers from precision. In addition, the method is applied in most cases on single physical components (bearings, gears, belts, etc.) and thus the interaction between the components of the whole system is not addressed. Model-based prognostics (also called physics of failure prognostics) deals with analytical modelling of the system including its degradation. This approach gives more precise results, but it is difficult to apply on complex systems for which the construction of the behaviour and degradation models is not a trivial task. Finally, the hybrid approach combines both model-based and data-driven approaches by keeping their advantages. This paper presents a framework allowing the development of hybrid prognostics. The framework relies on two main phases: an offline phase and an online phase. The first phase concerns the construction of the nominal and degradation models, and the definition of the faults and performance thresholds needed to calculate the remaining useful life of the system. The second phase deals with the utilisation of the models and thresholds obtained in the first phase to detect the fault initiation, assess the current health state of the system, predict its future health state and calculate its remaining useful life.

To ensure these requirements, several designs for self-diagnosing sensors were proposed in the past. However, such designs require additional instrumentation leading to further development and certification costs. To mitigate such costs, a methodology was sought to achieve similar self-diagnosis capabilities that can be retrofitted to already existing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) resolver sensors. To achieve this goal, this paper proposes a new approach for real-time tracking of resolver faults with the ability to perform real-time fault detection. However, the additional benefit of this approach is the ability to accommodate faults in real-time once a fault is detected. The primary fault studied in this paper is resolver channel mismatch. A formulation based on the physical operating principles for a resolver sensor is provided. Diagnostic measures are identified for use in statistical-based fault-detection routines.

To overcome this, a health monitoring of the system components is desirable but not yet available. In this paper, a method is presented that allows a model-based development of such a capability. This method uses physics-based models of system components in order to derive their behavior at considered fault modes with several extents. The gained knowledge is transferred into a model of the entire hydraulic system. This model is used to determine the fault effects on the system states in order to find candidate positions for sensors. The method allows finding an optimal set of sensors that enables the detection and isolation of system component faults. The system model is used further for the creation of a simplified steady-state nominal model, which is required for feature generation. On the basis of these features, support vector machines are trained for fault detection and isolation as well as the diagnosis of the actual fault extent. The developed health monitoring functions are validated on a test rig.

The quality of the input image sequence is a major factor affecting the ATR algorithm's ability to detect and recognize an object. If one can correlate the algorithm performance with different image quality measures, the recognition confidence can be predicted before applying ATR by predetermining the input image quality. In this paper, we address the utility of image quality measures and their correlations with performance failures of a principle component analysis (PCA) based ATR algorithm. Various image fusion approaches are examined to illustrate their abilities to improve ATR performance. Results show that the Shift Invariant Discrete Wavelet Transform (SiDWT) and Laplacian pyramid fusion schemes outperform other methods for improving the detection rate with the considered SAR images. Regression analysis is conducted to show that linear combinations of the selected image quality measures could explain about 60% of the variability in the non-detections of the ATR algorithm. ©2008 IEEE.","","Automatic target recognition; Discrete wavelet transforms; Electric fault currents; Food processing; Forecasting; Fusion reactions; Image quality; Image segmentation; Nuclear physics; Optical sensors; Regression analysis; Wavelet transforms; Algorithm performance; ATR algorithms; Automatic Target Recognition (ATR); Detection rates; Image quality measures; Input images; Laplacian pyramids; Linear combinations; Major factor; Principle component analysis; SAR imaging; Shift-Invariant Discrete Wavelet Transform; Target recognition; Image fusion","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-49349118076"

Different kinds of faults such as transverse cracks, imbalance, misalignment, bent shafts, and combinations thereof are considered. Off-line and on-line experimental tests are carried out. Different types of external excitation with piezoelectric actuators are introduced and the vibration responses in several dimensions are measured. Numerical and experimental results demonstrate that there are only subtle changes in the passive vibration natural frequencies and mode shapes due to cracks in the shaft; therefore, active sensing is necessary to detect damage.

Approaches for representing test results range from simple statistical models to neural networks to complex, physics-based models. Basing the model on test data could be problematical when testing becomes impractical with many years life time tests. So, real time estimation of battery performance, an important problem in automotive applications, falls into this area. In vehicles it is important to know the state of charge of the batteries in order to prevent vehicle stranding and to ensure that the full range of the vehicle operation is exploited. In this paper, several battery models have studied including analytical, electrical circuits, stochastic and electro-chemical models.

This study has developed an innovative anomaly detection strategy for bearing fault detection based on multi-sensing variables and a series of statistical data-driven approaches. The major advantage of using multi-sensors is that it enables the capture of abnormal signals due to different contact physics, e.g. phase transformation or surface cracking that may not be detected by one type of sensors. Experiments have been carried out on a bench top bearing test-rig under both normal and seeded defect conditions. Sensors measuring electrostatic charge, vibration and debris are used in this study. The signals under normal bearing conditions are used to train Gaussian mixture models (GMM) to establish a preliminary normal model for anomaly detection. The preliminary model is firstly adapted by a novel 'data cleaning' method that identifies and removes unexpected anomalies in the training data. The purpose of data adaptation is to eliminate fault masking by the anomalies during training. Seeded defect bearing tests provide signals containing data from bearing under 'faulty' or failure conditions. Hotelling's Tsquared statistics of the test data are used to detect anomalies in this study. The results from a series of bearing tests have demonstrated that the application of the GMM adaptation techniques based entropy score and distance can help to optimise trend of the T-squared statistic, minimise noise and extract/enhance valuable abnormal trends. Furthermore, to achieve the automatic detection with the T-squared statistic, a novel threshold set-up approach based on the combination of the GMM and extreme value theory (EVT) has been developed in this study. The threshold set by the new approach can reduce the false alarm rate by 20% compared to the thresholds set by other conventional thresholds. Details of the developed approaches as well as a comparison with some conventional approaches are presented in this paper.","","Condition monitoring; Machinery; Signal detection; Statistics; Surface defects; Automatic Detection; Bearing fault detection; Conventional approach; Data-driven approach; Electrostatic charges; Extreme value theory; Gaussian Mixture Model; Sensing techniques; Fault tolerant computer systems","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84905722513"

However, to ensure maximum performance, these PET scanners require proper calibration by qualified professionals, which can become a cumbersome task because of the large number of channels present. An intelligent system (IS) intends to alleviate this workload by enabling a diagnosis of the observational errors of the scanner. The IS can be broken down into four hierarchical blocks: parameter extraction, channel fault detection, prioritization and diagnosis. One of the main function of the IS consists of analyzing available channel data such as: normalization coincidence counts and single count rates, crystal identification classification data, energy histograms, APD bias and noise thresholds to establish the channel's health status that will be used to detect channel faults. This paper focuses on the first two blocks of the IS: parameter extraction and channel fault detection. The purpose of the parameter extraction block is to process available channel data into parameters that are subsequently used by the fault detection block to generate the channel's health status. To ensure extensibility, the channel fault detection block is divided into indicators representing different aspects of the PET scanner performance: sensitivity, timing, identification and energy. Some experiments on a LabPET scanner located at the Sherbrooke Molecular Imaging Center demonstrated an erroneous channel fault detection rate of 6% (with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of: [5, 6]) which is considered tolerable. Globally, the IS achieves a channel fault detection efficiency of 95% (CI: [92, 97]), which proves many faults can be detected automatically. Increased fault detection efficiency would be advantageous but, the achieved results would already benefit professionals in their maintenance task. © 2013 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence (AI); biomedical imaging; expert systems; fault diagnosis; fuzzy logic; positron emission tomography (PET)","Expert systems; Failure analysis; Fuzzy logic; Intelligent systems; Molecular imaging; Nuclear physics; Parameter extraction; Positron emission tomography; Scanning; Biomedical imaging; Crystal identification; Fault detection rate; Fault detection systems; Imaging capabilities; Observational errors; Positron emission tomography (PET); Positron emission tomography scanners; Fault detection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84904174123"

Health monitoring typically involves a suite of modules, including system monitoring, fault detection, fault diagnostics, and system prognostics. However, for systems which have not yet operated, this is challenging. Most available health monitoring modules are empirically based, meaning they are derived from available historic data. For new system designs, such data simply does not exist. This research proposes an adaptive modeling system which initially builds empirical models from high-fidelity simulated data. This data suffers from the common problems of data simulation caused by complicated physical models mechanisms and simplifying assumptions made in model development. As actual system data becomes available, the empirical models adapt in an automated and intelligent way to account for real-world, nominal data relationships. A key challenge in automatically adaptive empirical models lies in differentiating between faulted operation and nominal operation which is not well-described by the physics-based data. Nominal operation may extend beyond the simulated data for many reasons: the system may be operating in unanticipated environments; the assumptions made in model development may cause inaccuracies in the data; or the relationships modeled may simply be incorrect. Traditional fault detection methods such as those using the sequential probability ratio test are not able to distinguish between unexpected nominal operation and truly faulted operation. However, the main benefit of using adaptive models lies in their ability to accurately learn expanded nominal relationships while detecting and differentiating faulted conditions. For the purposes of accurately adapting a monitoring system, a principal component-based method is proposed to distinguish between these two cases. As faults are detected, fault diagnostics and system prognostics are employed to provide a complete health monitoring system. The proposed adaptive monitoring system is applied to simulated data of the newly designed International Reactor Innovative and Secure (IRIS) nuclear plant.","","Fault detection; Health; Principal component analysis; Systems engineering; Adaptive monitoring; Complex engineering system; Fault detection and diagnostics; Health monitoring system; International reactor innovative and secure; Principal Components; Sequential probability ratio test; Simplifying assumptions; Monitoring","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84920540284"

Existing systems employ data driven models which has limited prediction capability. On the contrary, a physics based model can predict phenomena that the system has not seen before. It also provides a means for root cause analysis. However, major obstacles include the complexity involved and real-time feasibility. In this paper, we use the bond graph technique to construct an analytical, physics-based model. We use a reciprocating compressor as an example since it is a good representation of multi-domain processes with a variety of possible failure modes. The bond graph model is cross examined with a finite element model and ultimately validated. To show how one can benefit from this approach, cracked piston rod is simulated to generate vibration signals that can potentially be picked up from accelerometers mounted on the exterior surface of the compressor.

Therefore, diagnostic solutions are necessary to quickly identify when a fault occurs, so that recovery actions can be taken or an abort procedure can be initiated. Model-based diagnosis solutions, established using an in-depth analysis and understanding of the underlying physical processes, offer the advanced capability to quickly detect and isolate faults, identify their severity, and predict their effects on system performance. We develop a physics-based model of a cryogenic propellant loading system, which describes the complex dynamics of liquid hydrogen filling from a storage tank to an external vehicle tank, as well as the influence of different faults on this process. The model takes into account the main physical processes such as highly non-equilibrium condensation and evaporation of the hydrogen vapor, pressurization, and also the dynamics of liquid hydrogen and vapor flows inside the system in the presence of helium gas. Since the model incorporates multiple faults in the system, it provides a suitable framework for model-based diagnostics and prognostics algorithms. Using this model, we analyze the effects of faults on the system, derive symbolic fault signatures for the purposes of fault isolation, and perform fault identification using a particle filter approach. We demonstrate the detection, isolation, and identification of a number of faults using simulation-based experiments. © 2011 IEEE.","","Cryogenic liquids; Dynamics; Helium; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Liquefied gases; Loading; Phase transitions; Propellants; Tanks (containers); Vapors; Complex dynamics; Cryogenic propellant; Fault identifications; Fault isolation; Fault signature; Helium gas; In-depth analysis; Liquid hydrogens; Model based diagnosis; Model-based diagnostics; Multiple faults; Non-equilibrium condensation; Particle filter; Physical process; Physics-based models; Propellant loading; Recovery actions; Simulation-based; Storage tank; Vapor flows; Spacecraft propulsion","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-79955786783"

As first-principle models of gearboxes capable of reflecting response details for health monitoring purpose are difficult to obtain, data-driven approaches are often adopted for fault detection, identification or classification. In this paper, we propose a data-driven framework that combines information from multiple sensors and fundamental physics of the gearbox. Time domain vibration and acoustic emission signals are collected from a gearbox dynamics testbed, where both healthy and faulty gears with different fault conditions are tested. To deal with the nonstationary nature of the wind turbine operation, a harmonic wavelet based method is utilized to extract the time-frequency features in the signals. This new framework features the employment of the tachometer readings and gear meshing relationships to develop a speed profile masking technique. The time-frequency wavelet features are highlighted by applying the mask we construct. Those highlighted features from multiple accelerometers and microphones are then fused together through a statistical weighting approach based on principal component analysis. Using the highlighted and fused features, we demonstrate that different gear faults can be effectively detected and identified. © 2012 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.","condition monitoring; data fusion; gearbox; response measurement; wavelet; wind turbine","Accelerometers; Acoustic emission testing; Condition monitoring; Data fusion; Principal component analysis; Sensors; Signal detection; Time domain analysis; Wavelet analysis; Wind turbines; Acoustic emission signal; Complex mechanical system; Data-driven; Data-driven approach; Fault conditions; First principle models; Fundamental physics; Gear faults; Gear meshing; gearbox; Harmonic wavelet; Health monitoring; Masking technique; Multiple sensors; Nonstationary; Response measurement; Signal processing technologies; Speed profile; Statistical weighting; Time domain; Time frequency; Time frequency features; Turbine operation; wavelet; Wavelet features; Fault detection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84863066638"

It forms part of the High Level Trigger of the ALICE experiment, whose goal is to reduce the large data rate of about 2S GB/s from the ALICE detectors by an order of magnitude, without loosing interesting physics events. The dHLT has been implemented as a software trigger within a high performance and fault tolerant data transportation framework, which is run on a large cluster of commodity compute nodes. To reach the required processing speeds, the system is built as a concurrent system with a hierarchy of processing steps. The main algorithms perform partial event reconstruction, starting with hit reconstruction on the level of the raw data received from the spectrometer. Then a tracking algorithm finds track candidates from the reconstructed hit points. Physical parameters such as momentum are extracted from the track candidates and finally a dHLT decision is made to readout the event based on certain trigger criteria. Various simulations and commissioning tests have shown that the dHLT can expect a background rejection factor of at least S compared to hardware triggering alone, with little impact on the signal detection efficiency. © 2008 IEEE.","","Restoration; Signal processing; Spectrometers; Spectrometry; Background rejection; Commissioning test; Concurrent systems; Detection efficiency; Event reconstruction; Event-based; Fault-tolerant; High-level triggers; Large clusters; Large data rate; Online processing; Order of magnitude; Physical parameters; Primary functions; Processing speed; Processing steps; Resonance decay; Tracking algorithm; Fault tolerant computer systems","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-67649238651"

Results acquired from an internal Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) study identified turn-to-turn winding faults as the primary mechanism, or mode, of failure. Physics-of-failure mechanisms used to develop a model for the identified fault are provided. The model was implemented in Simulink to simulate the dynamics of the motor with a turn-to-turn insulation winding fault. Then, an experimental test procedure was devised and executed to validate the model. Additionally, a diagnostic feature, identified by the fault model and derived using Hilbert transforms, was validated using the Simulink model and experimental data for several fault dimensions. Next, a feature extraction routine preprocesses monitoring parameters and passes the resulting features to a particle filter. The particle filter, based on Bayesian estimation theory, allows for representation and management of uncertainty in a computationally efficient manner.

The New Horizons spacecraft, designed, built and operated by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), was successfully launched in January 2006 and will perform its primary mission at Pluto in the summer of 2015. To support this mission, the spacecraft is equipped with onboard software that provides a rule based expert system for performing autonomous fault detection and recovery. This system has been updated nine times since launch and is continuously being tested to ascertain its performance in various spacecraft states. The test approach for the autonomous fault protection subsystem is to perform a combination of unit-level tests and full system scenario tests. For the scenario tests, we have developed a ""Lights Out"" test method and have been using it to reduce the time required to run each fault scenario test. This approach reduces the time it takes to develop a test, reduces the number of man hours required to run the test, and decouples the initial spacecraft state from the mechanisms used to inject faults. Decoupling the initial state from the fault injection allows for easy expansion in the number of initial state/fault combinations that can be tested. This significantly improves the test coverage of the scenario test suite.

Basing models on physics has the advantage of naturally describing nonlinear processes and potentially describing a wide range of operating conditions. Implementing adaptivity is essential for online use to avoid model performance degradation over time and to compensate for model imperfection. Requirements for identifiability and observability, numerical robustness and computational speed place an upper limit on model complexity. These considerations motivate the design of balanced-complexity physical models with adaptivity for online use. Techniques used in the design of balanced-complexity models are given with examples from offshore oil and gas production. Despite potential benefits, the effort required to implement balanced-complexity models, particularly at large scales, may deter their use. This paper presents a Modelica-based approach to reduce implementation effort by interfacing exported Modelica models with application code by means of a generic interface.

One way to reduce these costs would be to implement a structural health and prognostic management (SHPM) system as part of a condition based maintenance paradigm with smart load management. To facilitate the development of such a system a multiscale modeling approach has been developed to identify how the underlying physics of the system are affected by the presence of damage and faults, and how these changes manifest themselves in the operational response of a full turbine. This methodology was used to investigate the effects of rotor imbalance and shear web disbond on a 5-MW offshore wind turbine in the present report. Based on simulations of the model, the operational measurements that demonstrated the highest sensitivity to the damage/faults were the blade tip accelerations and local pitching moments for both imbalance and shear web disbond. Detection strategies have been developed for these fault mechanisms with the intent of being integrated into an operations and maintenance paradigm. The integration of the health monitoring information provides the initial steps to reducing operations and maintenance costs for an offshore wind farm while increasing turbine availability and overall profit. © 2013 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

The tasks performed by these motors grow increasingly complex because of modern industries hence there is a need to determine the faults. Early detection of faults will reduce an unscheduled machine downtime that can upset production deadlines and may cause heavy financial losses. This paper is focused in developing a computer based system using Fuzzy Inference system's membership function. An unusual increase in vibration of the motor could be an indicator of faulty condition hence the vibration of the motor of an induction motor was used as an input, whereas the output is the motor condition. An inference system of the Fuzzy Logic was created to classify the vibration characteristics of the motor which is called vibration analysis. The system classified the motor of the gas distribution pump condition as from 'acceptable' to 'monitor closely'. The early detection of unusual increase in vibration of the induction motor is an important part of a predictive maintenance for motor driven machinery. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.","condition monitoring; fault detection; Fuzzy inference system; induction motor; predictive maintenance","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84874157908"

However, serious technical challenges to implementing a general health management strategy for helicopters and military aircraft still exist. For example, severe heat and vibration make it difficult to distinguish fault signatures from environmental noise. Moreover, bearing loads are very dynamic, making it difficult to distinguish subtle wear-out signatures from normal acoustic patterns. Detection can be improved by increasing the number of sensor locations, but this option is unattractive from the standpoint of added cost, weight, and data overhead of such a system. Our approach is to integrate MEMS sensors with a standard commercial microcontroller and measurement electronics. In this way, prognostic sensors can be positioned closer to the stressed components and provide higher fidelity data with lower cost. We present an innovative design for a prognostics and health management (PHM) data recorder that will facilitate sense-and-response logistics, and provide a small and inexpensive package.

Prognosis is here strictly defined as ""predicting the time at which a component will no longer perform its intended function."" Loss of function is oftentimes the time at which a component fails. The predicted time to that point then becomes the remaining useful life (RUL). For prognostics to be effective, it must be performed well before deviations from normal performance propagate to a critical effect. This enables a failure preclusion or prevention function to repair or replace the offending components, or, if the components cannot be repaired, to retire the system (or vehicle) before the critical failure occurs. Therefore, prognosis has the promise to provide critical information to system operators that will enable safer operation and more cost-efficient use. To that end, the US Department of Defense (DoD), NASA, and industry have been investigating this technology for use in their vehicle health management solutions. Dedicated prognostic algorithms (in conjunction with failure detection and fault isolation algorithms) must be developed that are capable of operating in an autonomous and real-time vehicle health management system software architecture that is possibly distributed in nature. This envisioned prognostic and health management system will be realized in a vehicle-level reasoner that must have visibility and insight into the results of local diagnostic and prognostic technologies implemented at the line replaceable unit (LRU) and subsystem levels. Accomplishing this effectively requires an integrated suite of prognostic technologies that compute failure effect propagation through diverse subsystems and that can capture interactions that occur in these subsystems. In this chapter a generic set of selected prognostic algorithm approaches is presented and an overview of the required vehicle-level reasoning architecture needed to integrate the prognostic information across systems is provided. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Condition monitoring; Degradation; Distributed prognostics architecture; Particle filtering; Physics-based analysis; Remaining useful life","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84879169338"

It is felt the importance of this research work cannot be overstated with the constantly moving worldwide manufacturing base and the real situation of the machine designers being based in a different country to their customer. The most vulnerable areas of a machine are its parts that consist of electro-mechanical actuation.

The method for predicting catastrophic consequences due to leakage of liquid hydrogen (LH2) or liquid oxygen (LO2) from the ET's flange seals and instrument and electrical feed-through penetrations requires estimates of leak frequency, leak size, and leak tolerance. In general, the combined effects of these variables can be modeled using a combination of probabilistic and deterministic physics-based simulations, empirical data analysis, or expert elicitation depending on the availability of time, data, and resources. Process engineers at Michoud Assembly Facility (MAF) provided deterministic estimates of key parameters that effect leak tolerance for candidate seal locations in the Shuttle's wake area. The MAF study was a screening analysis to identify sites having the potential for a fire/explosion due to leaks. Using phenomenological models, they determined whether a leak site under worst-case assumptions had the potential to reach threshold fluid concentrations in the wake area sufficient to cause a fire/explosion. Seven sites were identified. Five associated with LO2 and two with LH2. Mission leak frequency at the system level was estimated from leak data contained in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) Problem Reporting and Corrective Action (PRACA) Database from January 1993 through December 2002. These data were entered into a Fault Risk Analysis Spreadsheet (FRAS) [2], which applies discount factors for probability of detection and effectiveness of corrective action evaluated for each PRACA leak record. The system-level leak frequency was then allocated to individual leak sites. The leak size distributions for the various sites were developed from historical telemetry leak data from the Orbiter Main Propulsion System (MPS) 17-inch disconnect between the ET and the Orbiter MPS. The medians of these datasets were scaled based on the ratio of the maximum leak rates for the seal and the 17-inch disconnect. The leak rate distribution was modeled as lognormal based on statistical goodness of fit tests. The dispersion of the leak-rate distribution was specified by equating an upper-tail percentile to the maximum leak rate distribution. The upper-tail percentile was determined by judgment through sensitivity analysis. A Monte Carlo simulation was created to model the uncertainty associated with several key parameters and to combine the mission leak frequency with the probability that a leak is critical to obtain a distribution for the overall probability of a critical leak. Within the Monte Carlo model, sampled data from three parameter distributions were used to generate leak size distributions and calculate the probability of a lognormal leak exceeding the critical leak rate. The probability of a critical leak at each site is the product of the mission leak frequency multiplied by the conditional probability that the leak is critical. The outcome from 20,000 trials of the simulation provided the data to generate empirical distributions. © 2006 by ASME.","","Liquefied gases; Monte Carlo methods; NASA; Risk assessment; Safety engineering; Size distribution; Space shuttles; Tanks (containers); Wakes; Catastrophic consequences; Conditional probabilities; Empirical distributions; Main propulsion systems; Phenomenological models; Physics-based Simulation; Probabilistic Risk Assessment; Probability of detection; Probability","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84892657211"

LEADER employs a set of sensors to monitor engine component performance, and to detect, identify and validate abnormalities with respect to varying engine dynamics and behavior. Two diagnostic approaches are adopted in the architecture of LEADER. In the first approach fault diagnosis is performed through learning and identifying engine behavior patterns. LEADER, utilizing this approach, generates few hypotheses about the possible abnormalities. These hypotheses are then validated based on the SSME design and functional knowledge. The second approach directs the processing of engine sensory data and performs reasoning based on the SSME design, functional knowledge, and the deep-level knowledge, i.e., the first principles (physics and mechanics) of SSME subsystems and components. This paper describes LEADER'S architecture which integrates a design-based reasoning approach with neural network-based fault pattern matching techniques.

Most of current MGT trackers use GMTI (Ground Moving Target Indicator) sensor, since this sensor provides the range-rate measurement (Doppler) aside classical position measurements. This helps the tracking algorithms and the preliminary ground target classification. Advanced algorithms include exogeneous information like road network and terrain topography. In this paper, we develop a new improved VS-IMM (Variable Structure Interacting Multiple Model) algorithm for GMTI tracking which includes the stop-move target maneuvering model, contextual information (on-off road model, road network constraints), and identification information arising from classifiers coupled with the GMTI sensor. The identification information is integrated to the likelihood of each hypothesis of our SB-MHT and allows to solve efficiently most of ambiguities that can arise mainly at road intersections or after a target maneuver when leaving the road, or with undetected ground targets after few scans. We maintain aside each target track a set of ID hypotheses with their committed beliefs which are updated on real time with classifier decisions through target type tracker based on a proportional conflict redistribution fusion rule. The advantage of such a new approach is to deal precisely and efficiently with the identification attribute information available as it comes by taking into account its inherent uncertainty/non-specificity and possible high auto-conflict. ©2008 IEEE.","","Classification (of information); Classifiers; Fault detection; Fusion reactions; Learning systems; Motor transportation; Nuclear physics; Position measurement; Risk assessment; Roads and streets; Sensor data fusion; Sensor networks; Sensors; Ship steering equipment; Target tracking; Tracking (position); Traffic control; Challenging problem; Classifier decisions; Contextual information; Doppler; Fusion rules; Ground moving target indicators; Ground targets; New approaches; Partial observations; Real environments; Real time; Road intersections; Road models; Road networks; Target Classification; Target detections; Target maneuvers; Terrain topography; Tracking algorithms; Traffic densities; Variable structure-interacting multiple model; Targets","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-49349114718"

In this paper, we present research results on intelligent FDD and characterization of MEMS flow sensor. Vectorized maps are created and calibrated for the purpose of intelligent FDD. In addition, maps of N-manifold can be used for redundancy in diagnosis to improve the accuracy and reliability of the methodology. Such redundant vectorized maps provide for explanation of physical significance of the behavior of the system and the formation or detection of faults. As a result, both physical-based and signal-based intelligent fault detection and diagnosis techniques and methodology can be applied for various types of applications. Experimental results suggest that intuitive choices of parameters and features, based on the understanding of physics of the mechanical-pneumatic system, can be applied with success to intelligent detection and diagnosis of faults.

Quantum computers are based on the controlled manipulation of entangled quantum states, which are extremely sensitive to noise and imprecision; active correction of errors must therefore be implemented without causing loss of coherence. Quantum error-correction theory has made great progress in this regard, by predicting error-correcting 'codeword' quantum states. But the coding is inefficient and requires many quantum bits, which results in physically unwieldy fault- tolerant quantum circuits. Here I report a general technique for circumventing the trade-off between the achieved noise tolerance and the scale-up in computer size that is required to realize the error correction. I adapt the recovery operation (the process by which noise is suppressed through error detection and correction) to simultaneously correct errors and perform a useful measurement that drives the computation. The result is that a quantum computer need be only an order of magnitude larger than the logic device contained within it. For example, the physical scale-up factor required to factorize a thousand-digit number is reduced from 1,500 to 22, while preserving the original tolerated gate error rate (10-5) and memory noise per bit (10-7). The difficulty of realizing a useful quantum computer is therefore significantly reduced.","","article; computer system; laser; mathematical analysis; physics; priority journal; problem solving; quantum mechanics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0033551339"

Among them, the gradient-based multi-resolution (GBMR) algorithm is known to effectively reduce ringing artifacts near edges compared with the discrete wavelet transform (DWT)-based algorithm. However, since the GBMR algorithm does not consider the diagonal direction, the ringing artifacts reduction is not satisfactory at diagonal edges. In this paper, we generalize the GBMR algorithm by adopting the wavelet structure. Thereby, the proposed algorithm improves the fusion process in high-frequency sub-bands so as to preserve details of input images. Meanwhile, the algorithm fuses the low-frequency sub-band by considering the overall contrast in the output image. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, we compare it with the DWT-based and GBMR algorithms. Experimental results clearly demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively reduces ringing artifacts for edges of all directions and greatly enhances the overall contrast while minimizing visual information loss. © 2007 IEEE.","","Algorithms; Boolean functions; Canning; Data fusion; Detectors; Discrete wavelet transforms; Electric fault currents; Evolutionary algorithms; Frequency bands; Fusion reactions; Image enhancement; Image fusion; Mathematical transformations; Multiresolution analysis; Nuclear physics; Scheduling algorithms; Security systems; Sensor data fusion; Sensors; Visual communication; Wavelet transforms; Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT); Experimental results; Fusion processes; Gradient-based; High-frequency (HF); Input Images; Low frequency (LF); Multi sensors; Multi-sensor fusion; Multiresolution (MR); Ringing artifacts; Sub band (SB); Visual informations; wavelet structure; Edge detection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-44849143097"

However, the physics behind the existence of such components are not clearly explained, also, issues such as voltage unbalance, constructional imperfections that produce similar effects are not addressed. Considering the aforementioned factors, a new approach is proposed to detect the stator winding inter-turn short circuit fault in squirrel cage induction motor by the residual voltage after AC dump. Through analyzing the reason of residual voltage, the harmonics of residual voltage in the stator winding were compared between healthy and unhealthy motor. When a few turns of a stator phase are short circuited, they get isolated from the balanced three-phase winding set and act as a pick-up coil to these harmonics irrespective of their pole pair numbers. As current flows in the shorted turns, these harmonics will be induced in the healthy portion of the winding. Since the mutual inductance between the shorted turns and the three phases are different, it will also be able to detect the faulty phase unequivocally. By thoroughly analyzing the changes of higher harmonic in the residual voltage after AC dump, the detection and location of inter-turn short circuits in the stator windings were made. One of the key problems is to establish the fundamental frequency of the residual voltage, the FFT-FS spectrum zooming method was adopted. The scheme is largely insensitive to the supply voltage and the fluctuation of load, also, it can diagnose an early fault of the stator winding. The experimental results demonstrate that the method is valid and effective.","Asynchronous motor; Fault diagnosis; Higher harmonic; Inter-turn short circuit; Residual voltage after AC dump; Stator winding","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-34547379305"

Full-field measurement of transient strain have been made in various board assemblies subjected to shock in various orientations. Feature-extraction for health monitoring of leadfree area array architectures based on statistical pattern recognition has been presented. Previous researchers have measured the transient-dynamics of board assemblies with high-speed imaging in conjunction with high-speed image analysis for measurement of relative displacement, angle, velocity, and acceleration [Lall 2006, Che 2006], high-speed data-acquisition systems with discrete strain gages [Lall 2004, 2005, Liang 2005] and with accelerometers for measurement of transient acceleration [Dunford 2004, Goyal 2000, Seah 2005]. Degradation in confidence value gives a leading indication of component failure. Package architectures examined include-flex ball-grid arrays, tape-array ball-grid arrays, and metal lead-frame packages. Statistical Pattern Recognition Techniques including, mahalanobis-distance approach, wavelet packet energy decomposition, and time-frequency (TFA) techniques have been investigated for system identification, condition monitoring, and fault detection and diagnosis in electronic systems. Explicit finite element models have been developed and various kinds of failure modes have been simulated such as solder ball cracking, package fall off and solder ball failure. Models developed include, smeared property models, Timoshenko-beam models, and explicit sub-models. Explicit finite-element models have been correlated with experimental data. The presented approach does not depend on continuity and therefore does not need daisy-chained devices for detection of failure. ©2008 IEEE.","","Ball grid arrays; Brazing; Condition monitoring; Correlation methods; Data acquisition; Diffractive optical elements; Electronics industry; Experiments; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Finite element method; Gages; Health; Image analysis; Imaging techniques; Metal recovery; Metals; Microelectronics; Optical correlation; Pattern recognition; Pattern recognition systems; Quality assurance; Reliability; Soldering; Speed; Statistical methods; Structures (built objects); Sulfate minerals; Thickness measurement; Wavelet decomposition; Welding; Acquisition systems; Array architectures; Beam modeling; Component failures; Confidence value; Digital image correlation; Electronic systems; Energy decomposition; Experimental data; Fault detection and diagnosis; Finite element modeling; Finite element modelling; Full-field measurements; Health monitoring; High speeds; High-speed data; High-speed imaging; Image Correlation; International conferences; Lead frames; Mahalanobis; Micro-systems; Multi-physics simulation; Optical measurements; Property models; Relative displacements; Solder balls; Statistical pattern recognition; Sub-models; System identification; Time frequencies; Transient strain; Ultra-high; Wavelet packet; Feature extraction","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-49249111021"

A collaborative sensor fault detection (CSFD) scheme is proposed here to eliminate unreliable local decisions when performing distributed decision fusion. Based on the pre-designed fusion rule, assuming identical local decision rules and fault-free environments, an upper bound is established on the fusion error probability. According to this error bound, a criterion is proposed to search the faulty nodes. Once the fusion center identifies the faulty nodes, all corresponding local decisions are removed from the computation of the likelihood ratios that are adopted to make the final decision. Performance evaluation results indicate a significant improvement in fault-tolerance capability from the proposed approach over the conventional decision fusion without utilizing CSFD.","Decision fusion; Distributed detection; Fault-tolerance; Sensor fault detection; Wireless sensor networks","Data fusion; Fault detection; Fault tolerance; Fusion reactions; Information fusion; Maximum likelihood estimation; Nuclear physics; Probability; Quality assurance; Reliability; Sensor networks; Sensors; Speech recognition; Decision fusion; Decision rules; Distributed decision; Distributed detection; Error bounds; Error probabilities; Fault-tolerant; Faulty nodes; Fusion center; Fusion rules; International conferences; Likelihood ratios; Local sensors; Performance evaluation; Sensor fault detection; Sensor faults; Upper bounds; Wireless sensor networks; Sensor data fusion","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-50149104590"

DESY is a high-energy particle physics research centre, located in Hamburg, Germany, and has been chosen as a home site for a new generation particle collider - X-Ray Free Electron Laser (X-FEL) accelerator. A need of implementing digital control systems inside accelerators main tunnel, brought a new hardware approach to low-cost design reliable compex circuits with respect to Single Event Effects (SEEs). The goal was to develop a high performance method without modifications in the FPGA architecture and without high area penalties. A SEU-tolerant, digital library has been created. From basic gates, through combinational and sequential cells to some more sophisticated units like memory blocks, code converters or arithmetical functions cells, in all elements upset detection and mitigation schemes have been implemented.

First, a continuous BBN model based on physics of the printing process and field data is developed. The model captures the causal relationships between the various physical variables in the system using conditional probability distributions. Next, the continuous BBN is discretized based on the principle of maximum entropy so that it can be implemented on commercially available software, Hugin. The resulting BBN can be used for the prediction of print quality behaviors, as well as for inference and fault diagnosis. Examples of network deduction and inference are presented to illustrate the usefulness of the BBN model. © 2000 by ASME","","Barium compounds; Fault detection; Printing presses; Probability distributions; Bayesian belief network models; Causal relationships; Field data; Model-based OPC; Network diagnosis; Printing field; Printing process; Printing system; Process data; Xerographic printing; Bayesian networks","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-57749108797"

Azimuthal anisotropy of amplitude vs. offset (AzAVO) is one common measure of seismic anisotropy for fracture detection. For this study, we calculated P-wave AzAVO attributes for a Lower Cretaceous lime-stone reservoir in east Texas. Our study tests AzAVO inversion for the relatively low-fold, fair data quality typical of some land surveys. We developed a workflow to integrate the AzAVO inversion with rock physics, forward seismic modeling, seismic-scale fault interpretation, image logs, and cores. Our AzAVO inversion method was based on Rüger's equation, which describes the observed reflectivity (R) as a function of incidence angle (θi) and acquisition azimuth (φi) to equal a function of normal incidence reflectivity (A0), amplitude vs. offset (AVO) slope (B0), anisotropy magnitude (B1), orientation of symmetry of anisotropy (φ0), and noise (ni): R(θi, φi) ≈ A0 + [B0 + B1 cos2(φi - φ0)] sin2 φi + ni.... (1) Inversion of Rüger's equation yielded four attribu te volumes (corresponding to A0, B0, B1, and φ0). Additionally, we proposed an additional data-quality parameter that describes the relative amount of the total reflection energy predicted by the model. Pre-inversion processing carefully preserved signal via random noise attenuation, superbinning, bandwidth balancing, and phase alignment. In general, AzA VO inversion displayed geologically interpretable high-anisotropy anomalies. Noise, however, limited our confidence for quantitative fracture prediction. On the flanks of the anticline, data quality was high (greater than 50% fit of observed to predicted amplitude). Here the magnitude of the anisotropy (B1) volume showed strong lineations parallel to northeast-southwest trending faults. Over the crest of the anticline, the inversion quality was degraded by an overburden effect, coincident with poor data quality (less than 50% fit). AzAVO orientation maps were noisy and in some places obscured by an acquisition footprint. Locally, however, AzAVO orientations were parallel to east-northeast fracture orientations from cores, maximum horizontal stress from image logs, and fast-velocity direction from a dipole-sonic log.

SRAM-based FPGAs can experience single bit flips in the configuration memory due to high-energy neutrons or alpha particles hitting critical nodes [6] in the SRAM cells, by transferring enough energy to effect the change. High energy particles can be emitted by cosmic radiation or traces of radioactive elements in device packaging. The result of this could range from unwanted functional or data modification, data loss in the system, to damage to the cell where the charged particle makes impact. This phenomenon is known as a Single Event Upset (SEU) and makes fault tolerance a critical requirement in FPGA design. This research proposes a shift in architecture from current SRAM-based FPGAs such as Xilinx Virtex. The proposed architecture includes an inherent SEU detection through parity checking of the configuration memory. The inherent SEU detection sets a syndrome flag when an odd number of bit flips occur within a data frame of the configuration memory. To correct a fault, the FPGA is partially reconfigured without interrupting the normal operation of the FPGA device. Existing solutions include: Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) systems [1, 2, 5]; readback and compare the configuration memory [4]; and periodically reprogramming the entire configuration memory, also known as scrubbing 14]. The advantages afforded by the proposed architecture over existing solutions include: faster error detection and correction latency over the readback method and better area and power overhead over TMR. © 2007 IEEE.","","Charged particles; Computer control systems; Consumer electronics; Cosmology; Dynamic programming; Electric network analysis; Electronics industry; Error analysis; Error correction; Error detection; Fault tolerance; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Health; High energy physics; Industrial engineering; Quality assurance; Radioactive elements; Reliability; Static random access storage; Systems engineering; Technical presentations; Technology; Uranium powder metallurgy; Alpha particles; Bit flipping; Configuration memory; Critical nodes; Data frames; Data losses; Data modification; Device packaging; Error detection and correction; Event detection; Field-programmable gate arrays; FPGA designs; FPGA devices; High assurance systems; High-energy neutrons; High-energy particles; International symposium; Low costs; Normal operation; Odd numbers; Parity checking; Power overhead; Proposed architectures; Single bit flips; Single-event upset; SRAM cells; TO effect; Triple-modular redundancy; Xilinx Virtex; Fault tolerant computer systems","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-48349086154"

The four issues considered here include: (1) Can we characterize, a priori, the difficulty of fault classification via self-organizing maps? (2) Do data reduction techniques improve fault classification performance and enable the implementation of data-driven classification techniques in memory-constrained digital electronic control units (DECUs)?, (3) When does adaptive boosting, an incremental fusion method that successively combines moderately inaccurate classifiers into accurate ones, help improve classification performance?, and (4) How to synthesize classifier fusion architectures to improve the overall diagnostic accuracy? The classifiers studied in this paper are the support vector machine (SVM), probabilistic neural network (PNN), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), principal component analysis (PCA), Gaussian mixture models (GMM), and a physics-based single fault isolator (SFI). As these algorithms operate on large volumes of data and are generally computationally expensive, we reduce the dataset using the multi-way partial least squares (MPLS) method. This has the added benefits of improved diagnostic accuracy and smaller memory requirements. The performance of the moderately inaccurate classifiers is improved using adaptive boosting (AdaBoost). These results are compared to the results of the classifiers alone, as well as different fusion architectures. We show that fusion reduces the variability in diagnostic accuracy, and is most useful when combining moderately inaccurate classifiers.

In particular, under the Neyman-Pearson framework, we address the design of binary local sensor quantizers for a binary hypothesis problem in the asymptotic regime where the number of sensors is large. Motivated by the sensor censoring idea for reduced communication rate, each sensor either transmits '1' to a fusion center or remains silent. By adopting energy detector as the fusion rule, we develop a procedure to obtain local sensor threshold that maximizes the Kullback-Leibler distance of the distributions of the fusion statistic under the two hypotheses. The proposed quantizerdesign is well suited for the emerging large scale resource-constrained WSNs applications. Numerical results based on Gaussian and exponential observations are presented to demonstrate the design procedure.","Asymptotic regime; Censoring sensors; Distributed detection; Wireless sensor networks","Data fusion; Fading (radio); Fading channels; Fault detection; Fusion reactions; Information fusion; Nuclear physics; Sensor data fusion; Sensors; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Applications.; Asymptotic regime; Binary local sensor quantizers; Censoring sensors; Communication rates; Design procedures; Distributed detection; Energy detectors; Energy-constrained; Fusion center; Fusion rules; Gaussian; International conferences; Kullback-Leibler distance; Large-scale sensor networks; Local sensors; Numerica l results; OF sensors; Quantizer design; Quantizers; Resource-constrained; Sensor networks","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-50149083483"

The New Horizons spacecraft, designed, built and operated by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), was successfully launched in January 2006. New Horizon's closest encounter with Pluto will occur in the summer of 2015. Upon completion of its primary science objectives at the Pluto encounter, the spacecraft is expected to visit one or more Kuiper Belt objects in the outermost region of the solar system. This long duration mission requires high reliability and imposes some demanding fault management requirements upon the spacecraft. The spacecraft is highly redundant with onboard software that provides a rule based expert system for performing autonomous fault detection and recovery. Generally referred to as Autonomy, this software's design was largely driven by two factors, the concept of operations for the mission and the level of redundancy in the spacecraft hardware. This paper examines the unique mission requirements that drove the Autonomy design. It discusses how the Autonomy system supports all of the various phases of the mission and provides examples of how unique mission requirements of the New Horizons mission were implemented. © 2007 IEEE.","","Fault detection; NASA; Planets; Software design; Solar system; Spacecraft; Autonomy design; Fault management; Mission requirements; Interplanetary flight","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-34548781292"

The advanced technique uses physics-based model with an optimal pursuit solution method. The technique automatically finds the best fault scenario to match measured (or test) data. The best fault scenario provides information about parameter deviations (i.e., fault detection) and fault-contributing components (i.e., isolation). The technique is independent of the thresholds used in fault detection as in some other techniques. The technique is effective even under the condition where data are scarce and widely spaced in time. Operational data from two Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries (IHI) IM270 engines were made available to Scientific Monitoring, Inc. (SMI). The purpose of the data is to apply SMI's model-based fault identification expertise to industrial power generation turbines. The investigation was conducted with extremely limited knowledge of the engines and their maintenance histories. The measured variables, provided in the data set, only include speed, air inlet temperature, power, exhaust temperature, fuel flow, and compressor discharge pressure. With these limited engine data, we modified an existing, generic model for turbine engines and developed the optimal pursuit method to ""hunt"" for suspicious fault states. The detection results were confirmed by the engine manufacturer IHI. The detection accuracy of this technique can be improved with additional data and knowledge about the IHI-IM270 engine. This technique can be readily generalized to fault/state detection of other types of equipment or assets in all industries.","","Compressors; Engines; Fuels; Health; Power generation; Signal processing; Fault detection; Fuel flow; Generic models; Isolation techniques; Turbines","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-11244285051"

In this work, we present an alternative method for evaluation of hypothesis probabilities. Global hypotheses are then represented with exclusive prodxict sets. Each product set has the potential of representing many global hypotheses. A method that generates the product sets is introduced, including a recursive formulation for computational tractability. In numerical evaluations, the method is compared to an optimization based method that, generates the n-best. hypotheses.

It consists of particles interacting by various types of mechanisms such as elastic-brittle forces and friction. Results of laboratory experiments have shown that the grain shape has a major influence on the frictional properties of fault gouge. In order to enable realistic simulations it is thus important to include the capability to model non-spherical particles into the simulation software. To achieve this goal a new class of particles with variable shapes have been implemented in the lattice solid model. The shape of the particles is described by an arbitrary number of piecewise spherical patches. This leads to a good balance between the computational cost of the contact detection and calculation of interactions between particles and the range of particle shapes available. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.","","Friction; Rock mechanics; Computational costs; Efficient implementation; Frictional properties; Laboratory experiments; Lattice solid model; Nonspherical particle; Realistic simulation; Simulation software; Computer software","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-35248848799"

This paper describes a comprehensive experimental study of bearing spall progression and a physics-based model being developed for bearing prognostics. The model computes the spall growth trajectory and time to failure based on operating conditions, and uses diagnostic feedback to self-adjust and reduce prediction uncertainty. The predictions compare very well to fault progression tests on both subscale bearings and full-scale turbine engine bearings. The experimental data has demonstrated that spall propagation is better behaved than once thought and can be predicted with high confidence. For turbine engine core thrust bearings with a typical mission mix, the prognostic window (first detection to failure) is on the order of 100 flight hours, which provides ample opportunity to plan future missions and maintenance activities with considerable safety margin. Since the model is physics-based, it is readily adaptable to most bearing applications, and a reduced order version has also been developed which is efficient enough to run on-board with little or no loss in accuracy. © 2006 IEEE.","","Aircraft propulsion; Fault detection; Maintenance; Service life; Turbines; Maintenance activities; Prediction uncertainty; Prognostic window; Turbine engine bearings; Roller bearings","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-34047115958"

An anomaly can be viewed as a misconception of how the plant is operating: a particular pump might not have been switched-on, a partial blockage might be developing, something more localized like a sensor fault might have occurred and so on. Any computer simulation, constructed to predict what is expected, is unlikely to mimic this situation because any simulation is largely a manifestation of what the modeller perceives to be going on. When solved in parallel with the plant (Figure 1), any physical model (obtained by applying laws of chemistry and physics) will fail to predict plant measurements accurately if an anomaly has arisen (A). There are two fundamentally different ways of proceeding, either the correct anomaly must be hypothesized by classifying its properties, and hence symptoms, (B) or the model can be adapted until the correct symptoms are predicted (C). The choice depends, very much, on the application. © 2000 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057710477"

Although the basic principles of MBR are well understood, its application to specific domains, especially in mechanical systems, has been restricted due to insufficient model fidelity. The traditional vibration analysis approach has been the main stay of powertrain diagnosis since accelerometers have proven to be the primary viable choice for gearbox instrumentation and monitoring. However, a suitable logical representation of mechanical components so as to facilitate diagnostic reasoning about their vibration characteristics is difficult to achieve. This paper exploits the physics behind the vibration signatures of gearbox components both in nominal and faulty operational modes, and attempts to extract and represent that knowledge in an MBR-friendly formulation. Based on these model constructs a complete, integrated, MBR methodology for fault diagnosis based on behavioral characteristics of system components is introduced in this paper. Finally, the implementation of this architecture on the intermediate gearbox (IGB) module of a helicopter powertrain is presented. Simulation results show the successful application of this methodology in the detection of input gear pinion damage in the intermediate gearbox of an H-60 helicopter.","Diagnostic decision tree; Fault propagation; Functional model; MBR; Structural model","Accelerometers; Computer simulation; Gears; Mathematical models; Structural analysis; Transmissions; Vibrations (mechanical); Diagnostic decision tree; Fault propagation; Functional model; Model-based reasoning; Structural model; Fault tree analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33746893017"

Azimuthal anisotropy of amplitude versus offset (AzAVO) is one common measure of seismic anisotropy for fracture detection. For this study, we calculated P-wave AzAVO attributes for a lower Cretaceous limestone reservoir in east Texas. Our study tests AzAVO inversion for the relatively low-fold, fair data quality typical of some land surveys. We developed a workflow to integrate the AzAVO inversion with rock physics, forward seismic modeling, seismic-scale fault interpretation, image logs, and core. Our AzAVO inversion method was based on Rüger's equation, which describes the observed reflectivity (R) as a function of normal incidence amplitude (A 0), AVO slope (B0), anisotropy magnitude (B1), anisotropy orientation (φ0), and noise (ni): R(θi , φi) ∼ A0 +[B0 + B1 cos2(φi - φ0)] sin 2θi + ni Inversion of Rüger's equation yielded four attribute volumes (corresponding to A0, B 0, B1, and Φ0). Additionally, we proposed a additional data quality parameter which describes the relative amount of the total reflection energy predicted by the model. Pre-inversion processing carefully preserved signal via random noise attenuation, super-binning, bandwidth balancing, and phase alignment. In general, AzAVO inversion displayed geologically interpretable, high anisotropy anomalies. Noise, however, limited our confidence for quantitative fracture prediction. On the flanks of the anticline, data quality was high (greater than 50% fit). Here the magnitude of the anisotropy (B1) volume showed strong lineations parallel to NE-SW trending faults. Over the crest of the anticline, the inversion quality was degraded by an overburden effect, coincident with poor data quality fit (less than 50%). AzAVO orientation maps were noisy and in some places obscured by an acquisition footprint. Locally, however, AzAVO orientations were parallel to ENE fracture orientations from core, maximum horizontal stress from image logs, and fast-velocity direction from a dipole sonic log.

Current bearing fault detection methods do not adequately consider the physics of bearing failures, and as a result they generally do not perform well in actual practice. Therefore the goal of this paper is to provide a physics-based foundation for rolling element bearing fault analysis. In order to achieve this goal, a detailed mechanical model of an electric motor is developed with particular emphasis on the bearings and the introduction of bearing faults. Experiments are conducted on a real motor in order to parameterize and validate the detailed model of the motor/bearing system. The model is a 29 degree-of-freedom, nonlinear, time variant representation of the motor/bearing system, including a treatment of the Hertzian contact forces between the bearing elements as well as including a flexible, user-definable method for simulating faults ranging from initial spalls to advanced surface damage. Subsequent to model parameterization and verification, multiple and distributed bearing faults (i.e. advanced surface damage) are explored computationally. The results of these system response predictions indicate that envelope analysis, an established bearing fault detection method based on the demodulation of the system's vibration response, may be employed in some circumstances not only to detect, but also to diagnose single faults, multiple faults, and distributed faults. More importantly, the relative magnitudes of the defect frequencies and especially their harmonics in the envelope spectra are shown in specific cases to indicate the nature of a particular bearing fault. © IMechE 2004.","","Bearings (machine parts); Computer simulation; Demodulation; Electric motors; Harmonic analysis; Induction motors; Rolling; Vibration measurement; Fault detection; Mechanical model; Rolling elements; Stratification; Rotating machinery","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-20844445159"

Monitoring and diagnostic of operational data is successfully used to prevent unexpected plant shut downs and to schedule maintenance activities. A complete set of tools is presented, which is used to monitor combined-cycle power plant operation. The daily incoming data is analyzed with a physics-based performance model, with a neural network-based novelty detection tool and with an experience-based failure detection algorithm, which looks for fingerprints of known and possible component faults. A knowledge management system is used to support the assessment of the findings and the recommended actions are communicated to the power plant operators in the form of early warnings. The application of the different methods in parallel shall ensure that most of the emerging problems are detected before they result in damage that leads to a forced plant shut down. Most of the cases are simple measurement errors, although component deterioration and failures can also be detected. Experience with the ALSTOM early warning system for the GT24/GT26 power plants is shown to demonstrate the successful application of this approach.

The concepts of qualitative physics reasoning and function-oriented diagnostics are employed in the design of PRODIAG and result in two unique capabilities not found in other plant-level diagnostic systems. First, PRODIAG is fully portable as it requires only modification of the input files containing the appropriate process schematics information to be able to diagnose single-component failures in different processes/plants. Second, PRODIAG detects unanticipated faults. Hence, it does not require the prespecification and formulation of rules to cover every conceivable fault scenario, and unlike traditional approaches, it is not likely to misdiagnose unforeseen events. PRODIAG's approach is to map process symptoms into component faults through a three-step mapping procedure with a knowledge base containing three distinct types of information: qualitative macroscopic balance equation rules, functional classification of process components, and the process piping and instrumentation diagram. The concepts introduced in the proposed diagnostic system are described, and an illustrative example shows how they are used in plant-level diagnostics.","","Error analysis; Knowledge based systems; Process engineering; Transients; Fault diagnosis; Nuclear power plants","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0033089769"

One is to model from first principles the physics of fault initiation and propagation. Such a model must include detailed knowledge of material properties, thermodynamic and mechanical response to loading, and the mechanisms for damage creation and growth. Alternatively, an empirical model of condition-based fault propagation rate can be developed using data from experiments in which the conditions are controlled or otherwise known and the component damage level is carefully measured. These two approaches have competing advantages and disadvantages. However, fusing the results of the two approaches produces a result that is more robust than either approach alone. In this paper, we introduce an approach to fuse competing prediction algorithms for prognostics. Results presented are derived from rig test data wherein multiple bearings were first seeded with small defects, then exposed to a variety of speed and load conditions similar to those encountered in aircraft engines, and run until the ensuing material liberation accumulated to a predetermined damage threshold or cage failure, whichever occurred first. © 2006 IEEE.","","Aircraft engines; Bearings (machine parts); Damage detection; Service life; Speed; Thermodynamic properties; Damage threshold; Fault propagation; Prognostics; Algorithms","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-34047239121"

In this work a statistical method capable of independently monitoring a single sensor, and thus enhancing reliability and overall system safety, is introduced. The method's main advantages are simplicity, applicability to a wide variety of aircraft operating conditions, the handling of uncertainties, no need for additionally monitored signals, and no need for physics based aircraft dynamics models. The method is based on a statistical time series framework accounting for random effects and uncertainties, and exploits the fact that abrupt faults are characterized by time constants smaller than those of the aircraft. It employs monitored signal nonstationarity removal, signal whitening via novel pooled autoregressive modeling, statistical decision making, as well as electronic spike/glitch removal logic. The method effectiveness is demonstrated within the simulation environment of a small commercial aircraft via test cases and Monte Carlo experiments with abrupt faults occurring in an angle-of-attack sensor. © 2008 IEEE.","Aircraft control systems; Angle-of-attack sensor; Fault diagnosis; Sensor abrupt faults; Statistical methods","Aircraft; Aircraft models; Control systems; Decision making; Detectors; Fish; Game theory; Management science; Problem solving; Random processes; Sensors; Statistical methods; Statistics; Systems engineering; Theorem proving; Time series analysis; (+ mod 2N) operation; (I ,J) conditions; Aircraft control systems; Aircraft dynamics models; aircraft sensors; Angle of attack (AOA); AutoRegressive (MAR) modeling; Commercial aircraft; Hardware redundancy; Monte Carlo experiments; Non-stationarity; Operating conditions; Random effects; Signal whitening; simulation environments; Single sensors; Statistical decision; System safety; Test cases; Time constants (TC); Time Series; Flight control systems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-46849098186"

For safety-critical systems, ISHM must maintain safe operations while increasing availability by preserving functionality and minimizing downtime. This paper discusses a model-based approach to ISHM that combines fault detection, isolation and identification, fault-adaptive control, and prognosis into a common framework. At the core of this framework are a set of component oriented physical system models. By incorporating physics of failure models into component models the dynamic behavior of a failing or degrading system can be derived by simulation. Current state information predicts future behavior and performance of the system to guide decision making on system operation and maintenance.1,2 We demonstrate our approach on the fluid loop of a secondary sodium cooling loop of a nuclear reactor system. We model the fluid loop at the system level and a generic pump system at the component level. Monitoring and diagnosis at the system level may point to faults and degradation in components, e.g., the pump. A more detailed analysis of the pump using structural and material models may point to physics of failure models that explain degradation in the pump components. This information can form the basis for prognostic analysis that forms the core methodology for monitoring system performance and decision making for maintenance. © 2007 IEEE.","","Accident prevention; Availability; Decision making; Maintenance; Mathematical models; Nuclear reactors; Structural health monitoring; Critical systems; Fluid loops; Systems analysis","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-34548752234"

The mathematic models of these subsystems, based on the physics of the processes involved, consist of time-varying nonlinear ODEs. The diagnostic problem focuses on the detection and isolation of a specific set of alternator faults, including belt slipping, rectifier fault and voltage regulator fault. An in-depth analysis of the models is conducted in order to understand the effects of different failure modes on system performance; subsequently, an equivalent input-output model of the alternator is formulated and parameterized. The equivalent model permits considerable simplification of the algorithms. The proposed diagnostic approach is based on the generation of residuals obtained using system models and comparing the predicted and measured value of selected variables, including alternator output current, field voltage, battery current, battery voltage and battery temperature.
